PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #19, for September 30th, 2005

"The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new
facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them."
- Sir William Bragg


Dear PsiPog Users,

Howdy! Sorry for such a long delay from the last newsletter. Oh
well, life happens :-P. I do have some cool news: I made an
updated design for PsiPog.net, which I plan on implementing
pretty soon. This new design was made with three goals in mind:
1. Faster loading, 2. Link to future forums, and 3. Look cooler.
Check out this preview: http://psipog.net/newlayout.png

Other than that, I have a lot of mail built up from the weeks
gone by, so let's jump into the mail bag.

=================================================================

"I think that the reason PK is much more successful when you are
not focusing because even when you believe in it, if you've been
brought up your whole life learning that these things aren't real
then your subconscious is going to believe it's not, even though
you WANT to believe it is. Follow me? An idea for those who can't
seem to do PK, try doing something else AS you are practicing PK
to "distract" your subconscious into a book, a TV show, or
something else."

My comments: Cool idea. Sounds like an interesting theory -
perhaps it will work for some people out there who are having
trouble.

=================================================================

Shane writes:
"In the last newsletter there was a question that had something
to do with TK along the lines of, "Why can't I do TK when I
focus, and when I don't focus, I can do TK?" Well, this may be a
long shot, but here goes. I have been reading a book that gave me
a few good ideas to psionics. One idea has an answer (kind of).
Basically, it's S.E.P. - Somebody Else's Problem. That is, for an
example they gave, if some one wants to make something dissapear,
there is no possible way the conscious can do this. But if we
were to make it "somebody else's problem" (i.e. our subconcious)
it's basicly already done. So, if we were to think for TK, "oh,
it will move on it's own, besides, it's not my problem" it might
be possible to move it. This is just one thought."

My comments: Interesting thought - try it out and see if you get
results.

"I have been practicing psi for some time, and I have been having
some real trouble with OOBE's. I can easily have one when I sleep
and have a lucid dream. But when I try to do it from a trance, I
just can't do it. I have only been able to have an OOBE from a
trance once, and it was on accident. Do you have any tips?"

My comments: I'm the other way around - I find it very hard to
have OBEs from lucid dreams, but find it a lot easier to do them
in trance. My question is: why do you care HOW the OBE happens?
Getting OUT is the hard part - and you've done it! Of course,
if you're just curious and want to push your limits, then that's
cool :-).

"I was reading the PsiPog Newsletter #18, and was concerned about
the following advise that you gave to Diego:

>> Diego writes: "A friend of mine told me that some "bad",
>> powerful and ancient entity has "found me" ... Do you think it
>> is safe for ME to have an OBE while this entity has the
>> knowledge of my existence?"
>>
>> My comments: The first thing I am skeptical of is your friends
>> statement that some ancient entity has "found you". ...
>> Another question to ponder is: why does some ancient entity
>> care about you? Don't you think they have better things to do?

I'm just wanting to say a few things about your response, and I
do not intend any offence, but it did seem pretty ignorant and I
don't believe what you have said is very valid. First of all, you
seem to be making a less of a deal about this than it actually
is. Diego's friend may be an advanced psychic and know very well
if he is being followed by a negative entity. Why does an
ancient entity care about him? Why does any? Food, basically...
If an entity wants to be able to stay at this level of existence,
it needs to feed energy from people. I'd suggest to Diego that he
reads Psychic Self Defence, as that will give a good idea about
what he's facing, and how to counteract it."

My comments: The reason I didn't give that advice is because I
don't believe that advice is very helpful. Your advice relies on
three VERY BIG "ifs". If ancient entities feed off people for
food, and If Diego's friend is an advanced psychic, and If the
authors of Psychic Self Defence know what they're talking about,
THEN you have given good advice. Those are HUGE questions that
you have glossed over very quickly. In all honestly, Diego's
question falls outside the scope of PsiPog.net (we don't deal
with "ancient entities" and other "negative entities"), and the
only reason I answered it was to give him a different perspective
that he might not have expected.

"Hey I'm a big fan of your site, but I have always wondered why
you never touch on the mirror aspect of the supernatural.
Whenever I gaze at it I always feel a different presence in the
reflection and it always alarms me. I was wondering if you've
ever heard of this?"

My comments: I've heard of it, and I don't really know what is
going on. If I had to guess, I would theorize that your mind is
just playing tricks on you. I've done the exercise and had the
same alarming feeling - it's indeed strange. We don't touch on
it at PsiPog.net because it seems a little useless. It almost
feels more like an optical illusion rather than something
supernatural (to me, at least).

Admiral N writes:
"Is it normal to forget an OBE that you had even last night?
Also, I tried pyrokinesis on an already extinguished match. I
concentrated my psi on it and imagined it getting evenloped in a
blanket of fire. I opened my eyes and I saw the match
steaming/smoking. I didn't believe it and I blinked for a second
and then it was gone... Did I do it or was it just my brain
making my eyes see what I was trying to do?"

My comments: To answer your first question - yes, a lot of times
it's hard to remember entire OBEs. I suspect it's related to
being in an altered state of consciousness close to sleep, where
your memory starts to shut down. To answer your Pyro-PK
question: I don't know! Sounds like a cool experience though.
My advice is to try and REPEAT what you did. It's always hard to
figure out if ONE event was something psychic or fake - if you
can make it happen over and over again, then it's a lot easier to
figure out what is going on.

=================================================================

Rackjack asks:
"I know trying too hard to use Psi can make you pass out and
such, but is it possible to train to use strong amounts of psi
without being affected at all by it?"

My comments: Yes - the body learns to adapt to handle more over
time.

=================================================================

Psiballer writes:
"I've been trying to do OBEs for about 3 days now and I'm not
having much luck. When I'm laying still, am I supposed to have my
eyes opened or closed? And when I do actually complete an OBE, is
it like looking through a different set of eyes, or is it like
you can feel your whole "body" is separted from your physical
body? Because when I tried, once I felt like a separate pair of
eyes were going through my house. Like, I saw my celing, but in
front of that vision I saw a clear vision of my house, like
outside my door was the hallway, etc."

My comments: Your eyes should be closed while you lay still.
Your experience sounds sort of like an OBE, but it also sounds
pretty strange :-P. I honestly don't know what you experienced,
or whether that was an OBE or not. It depends on how "real" the
second vision was. OBEs are not visualizations in your mind;
they often feel so real that you might confuse it with really
walking around in normal life. As I state on PsiPog.net, there
have been times when I've fallen out of my body while in bed, and
thought I actually physically fell out of my bed! :-P

=================================================================

Eeg writes:
"Since you can communicate directly with your subconscious,
instead of visualization do you just tell your subconscious what
you want to happen with the psi and it does it, or do you have a
more direct role in the manipulation?"

My comments: Usually I do what you describe - I internally
vocalize to my subconscious what I want, and it happens. I don't
do this EVERY time (sometimes I use visualization, sometimes I
use tactile feelings, and sometimes I just do it by sensing where
the psi is and willing it).

Jick writes:
"I do enjoy those movies you guys make. Can you make one of a
floating toothpick? So that it is not touching the ground at all?
For doing this seems like a simple task for a psi-expert."

My comments: That depends on how you define "psi-expert". For me
personally, making a toothpick float seems insanely hard. I have
had a lot of requests for more media, so I'll see what I can do.
