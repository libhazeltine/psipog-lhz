                  <p>First and second, I love this site, and an odd thing is, most of the time I try something for the first time, I have small results, still results. Is this normal in psionics?</p>

                  <p>My main question is, I was trying macro-pk for the first time with the string only, made sure no vents were going, covering my mouth, stuff like that, and the string was vibrating back and forth very fast. Was that pk at work?</p>

                  <p>It could have been PK... but you always have to triple check everything to make sure sensative things like that aren't being influenced by wind or vibrations. Take a good 20 minutes to explore the limitations of your string to see what will make it move and what won't - that way, if/when you move
                  it later, you can be sure it was PK.</p>

                  <p>How come you need to train?I don't train and my power grew cause I used a hemispheric brainwave synchonisation cd.I turned from unable to move the psiwheel to able to move it easily within 5 days.You also said that you need to train your mind for different aspects of psychokinesis.Why is
                  that?Anyway, thanks.Bye!</p>

Because your body and mind have to learn new things to perform a specific action. I believe it's the same thing with PK.</p>

                  <p>Hey guys I got a question for ya.</p>

                  <p>Ok so far (with telekinesis) I've only moved my foil psi wheel and nothing else (I've tried straws, batteries, even a pencil or two).Further more I cannot move the psi wheel under a cup. Isn't it just the heat from my hand spinning it?<br />
                  And the cup is blocking the heat?</p>

                  <p>I read on another site that you cant use telekinesis for fame,It just wont work. And all Im doing is seeking glory..:S Is this true or do I just have to practise longer?</p>

                  <p>Sorry just one more question. Moving the psiwheel came in like 6 days for me. So does moving bigger things take longer or something diffrent????</p>

                  <p>Thanks LOADS guys!!!!</p>

                  <p>1) It _might_ be the heat from your hands, or it might simply be that you need to use more "oomph".</p>

                  <p>2) The "can't use tk for fame" nonsense is in the same white-lights-and-fluffy-bunnies category as "you will lose you psi-ability immediately if you ever have a selfish or impure thought". Both are demonstrably false.</p>

                  <p>3) Moving bigger things takes more "oomph".</p>

                  <p>Hey guys,<br />
                  I was practicing tk and energy manipulation a while ago and I was able to spin the psi-weel pretty well. But I took a brake for a month or so and now I just want to focus on tk. Now I cant spin the psi-weel at all?. So I was wondering, could energy manipulation enhance my tk skills or what?</p>
