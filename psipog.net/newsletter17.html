PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance

Newsletter #17, for July 22nd, 2005

"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking
they don't have any."

Dear PsiPog Users,

Hello! I hope everyone is doing well :-). Let's see, what news
do we have? Well hmmm... how about... FOUR new articles! Yay!

How to Measure/Verify Your Skills by me
Product Review: The Gateway Experience - Part 1 by me
Researching Psi - Part 1, Telepathy by SunTzu
Out of Body Experiences by me.

Check out http://psipog.net/home.php for links in the news, or
see the "Recent Articles" list on http://psipog.net/articles.php

Anything else? Not really... The new chat has been working well,
and I will eventually be updating the PsiPog Chat Client to
support the new system (but it will be optional to use). I've
been working on the forums during my free time, and they're
coming along slowly but steadily.

Other than that, let's jump into the mail bag!

"I want to ask you what do yo think is the relation between
psionics (understood as the voluntary production of psychic
phenomena) and the events observed in ouija sessions. I've been
present in lots of sessions and I've seen floating tables and
glasses, a three-seat sofa moving violently (with people seated
on), spontaneous writing in sheets of paper, "presents" brought
from another places, and some more weird stuff. What do you
think? Have you ever seen similar shit?"

My comments: No I haven't! But that would be pretty crazy to
witness. The ouija board is outside the scope of PsiPog.net,
but I wanted to comment on this anyways because I find it
amazing that you actually experienced these things first hand.
From a skeptical/scientific point of view, I recommend trying to
reproduce these events while recording it on tape, or something
like that. Investigate. Think logically. Try switching things
up and see what happens.

"Is it possible for psi skills to go in cycles... I haven't been
able to use mine as much as I want the last six months and
suddenly they all just hit me like a bag full of bricks. I am
natural with many psi abilities/gifts but this just never
happened to me before. Another question is do you know anyone I
can talk to that can help me control my empathy because it's
really getting out of hand an I can't control it."

My comments: To answer your first question, yes - skills can go
in cycles. Sometimes you just have to roll with the punches.
Six months seems a little long for a cycle, but it's possible.
I personally go in cycles of about 1-2 months.

To answer your second question - I can't point you to someone
specifically who can help you with your empathy problems, but I
can give you some advice on how to control it. The common
solution is to shield. Shield shield shield. Learn to create a
bubble shield, and visualize the shield blocking emotions of
other people, and keeping your emotions inside untainted. Check
out my article on shields, titled "Common and Not-So-Common
Shields" - if you are still having trouble after a week, grab me
in the chat and I might be able to help you one on one. But
please try it out for a week and see if you get progress.

"I have an idea for TK. I dont know if that already exist but
well, here I go: it's turning a fan on so the pinwheel starts
spinning in one direction, then with TK you try to spin it in the
other direction."

My comments: Good idea :-). In fact, sometimes people find it
easier to stop objects, or redirect already-moving objects
(rather than starting objects from rest). Another exercise you
can try is to roll a marble, and try to get it to change it's
path while it is rolling. Some people find that easier, so give
it a shot!

"I just tried something out with Psi balls that's pretty cool,
and I thought I'd share it. I found an alternate way that works
quite well for me to transfer the Psi from my abdomen region to
the palms of my hands. I sing it out. I guess it helps me to
feel the energy more easily... who knows? But I just visualized
the Psi comming out with my voice and into my hands, and it gave
pretty good results. It might be my imagination, but I think I
may have event seen an outline of the Psi ball when I did this.
If you like to sing, give it a try!"

My comments: Dang! Great idea! I've never heard of this, but
I bet it would work for some people :-).

"After some practice I found that the psi wheel is affected a lot
by the person's state of mind. (just like it was stated in the
July 9th newsletter)...for example I would finally get the wheel
to move and I would get a little excited and it would stop
instantly. I became frustrated due to the abrupt stops and the
paper wouldnt move at all which would inevitably drop my
confidence.

So I tried to find a way to make myself 'feel' my confidence
building due to the fact that confidence plays a large role in
psi skill.

You start off staring at the psi wheel like normal (do what you
would normally do) and if the paper moves, good for you, keep on
doing what your doing... but if the paper doesnt move and just
sits there after several minutes and starts to look like
frustration is on its way, DO NOT get mad. Close your eyes and
keep them closed and tell yourself that the paper is moving right
now. 'Feel' the paper moving in between your hands, 'know' that
it is moving. Do this for however long it takes to 'know and
feel' the paper moving, then tell yourself that the paper will
stop moving now. 'Feel' it stop; 'know' it's stopping.

Now open your eyes and behold, the paper has stopped moving. You
know the paper had moved and you know you have sucessfully
stopped it when you felt you couldnt do it before with your eyes
open. Now go on with your regular training.

I know this technique doesn't really sound much like a 'real'
technique but it has been an invaluable tool to me during times
where the paper would just not move an inch. I would start to
get frustrated and do the technique, and feel much more relaxed
and confident (almost like a mini-meditation exercise)."

My comments: This seems to be an extension of fooling your
subconscious, plus it adds a relaxing twist to it. You're right,
confidence does play a role. This mental exercise might not
produce results directly, but it sounds like it will put you in
the right state of mind to GET results. Leave the frustration
behind, just know you can do it, and relax! :-)
