   <p>Basically, this article is aimed at all those questions about psi balls I got in my inbox that I never answered (sorry to all you guys out there, it's not as easy as you think <img src="smile.gif"

        height="12"

I understand that some people would disagree with my answer, that's OK, if you feel I left something out or wrote something stupid, write an article and send it to me entitled "Peebrain is a peebrain"

   Yes. It's NEVER happened when I tried to make one, it's only happened when I didn't specifically say "This one is gonna be visible." So don't try to make a visible one and don't get hung up over it... it'll happen naturally!<br />

   <br />
   It doesn't have to look like anything. I've seen shinny dots (like when you hit your head, looks kinda like glitter) and blue wavy snake things. That's personally. Other people that have e-mailed me have said they've seen sparks, the snake things, and fog balls (no, not frog balls <img src="smile.gif"

   <br />
   I'm not sure. I've made visible ones that I could see but no one was around to ask their opinion. I have had e-mails of friends seeing each-others psi balls, so it's quite possible. If I were to make an educated guess, I'd say some are visible to everyone, and some are visible to people who are into aura
   vision.<br />

   <br />
   I've never heard of them being bright enough to light up a room or anything, but I believe it's possible. People have told me it's easier to see them in the dark - maybe because theirs emitted light rather than reflecting it... I don't know.<br />

   <br />
   It takes me about 1 or 2 minutes to make a psi ball that's visible. But I can't go into it thinking I want a visible one. I usually spend 1 or 2 minutes on every psi ball, and some are just visible. I don't think time period matters as much as the effort/emotion behind it. This one guy said he could make visible
   psi balls like crazy when he was excited and hyper. Different emotions cause different things so it's always hard to judge how long something takes.<br />

         id="visib6"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Do you have real pictures of psi balls?</span><br />
   <br />
   Nope. There are a couple reasons why. First, I don't have a buddy here to take the picture for me, so I'd have to make the psi ball then take the picture without losing concentration. Second, I can't make visible psi balls on command. I'd have to carry around a camera with me and make psi balls and when I saw one,
   I'd have to take the picture.<br />

   <tt>[Update]</tt> PsiPog.org DOES have pictures of real psi balls though - check out the 'Media' section!<br />

   I'm not sure if it's possible to colorize your psi ball. I believe it is, but I have no real proof. The only colors I've seen are blue and white. Blue snakes and white stars (yellow moons and green clovers <img src="smile.gif"

   Yes. I can't see auras willfully and I've seen my psi balls. I don't know if it was spontaneous aura vision, but I haven't learned aura vision and have seen psi balls.<br />

   In conclusion, don't get all hung up if you don't see your psi balls. It's not a big deal as long as you can feel them. If you want to see them so you can show other people, rethink your motive. Why do you want to show other people, to make them believe? Let them believe what they want. If you want to make a
   visible one to prove to yourself that they exist, forget it. You already know they exist so move on...<br />

         id="visua0"></a><span style="font-size: 110%;">Am I imagining the correct thing?</span><br />
   <br />
   You can imagine ANYTHING you want! It doesn't have to be one specific thing for it to work. As long as it is defined as "energy" in your mind, then it'll work. For example, if I say "car" then what do you imagine? Maybe a Dodge Viper, maybe a Ford Model-T, maybe a ton of other things - get my point? If I say
   "energy" you can imagine whatever... personally, I think of energy as electricity or smoke. But you can imagine water, butterflies, marbles, spheres, wind, fire... WHATEVER! As long as it's "energy" in your mind, it doesn't matter what you visualize.<br />

   <br />
   Anything you want. I can tell you what I visualize so maybe you can get an idea though. First I imagine myself standing on the earth and all the energy from inside the earth is rushing up and through my legs. Then as the energy comes through my body I direct it out through my arms. I visualize it swirling around my
   arms and going into my hands where the psi ball is. Inside the psi ball, I imagine the energy spinning really fast and as I add energy, it gets denser and denser. That works for me; make up your own thing and it'll work too with practice.<br />

   <br />
   Visualization is basically imagining something - kinda like pretending. If I tell you a story, you can imagine what's happening in your head, this is nearly the same thing. Just focus your whole mind on the task and don't get distracted.<br />

   <span style="font-size: 110%;">Summary</span><br />

   In conclusion, don't think there is a specific thing for you to think for this to work. Every psychic has their own method. Make your own and don't worry about if it's "correct" or anything - if it works then it works, who cares what other people do. Just some tips though, when you are visualizing something, try to
   use as many senses as possible. For example, when I visualize the energy rushing/spiraling down my arms, I "hear" a WOOSH sound and I "feel" the energy going over my arms. I don't really hear it, and I usually don't really feel it (I do more now than before) but it helps make it more solid.<br />

   <br />
   It's real easy to throw them, the only hard part making sure the energy stays in ball-form and not just fly all over the place. Keep your concentration, let it go with your hands, and direct it through visualization. Basically, you just think "the ball is there, now it's there, now it's there" and move it around
   the room that way. I've never done it with a visible psi ball, so I don't know if it really is doing what I'm telling it to do, put when I direct it back into my hands I can feel it again. That's my method, I'm sure there are others...<br />

Certain one's, yes, I believe people will feel it. One of my friends e-mailed me and said he can send psi balls to other people. If he sends it fast, it stings more, but
         if he sends it a little slower, they feel a tickle.<br />

   This is how I do it:

      <li>Imagine the source (ex: the Earth)</li>

      <li>Imagine you</li>

      <li>Imagine the energy coming from your source and flowing into your body</li>

      <li>Imagine the energy entering your body doing whatever (making a shield, creating a psi ball... whatever)</li>
   </ul>That's all I do. Just some tips - let the energy fffllloooooooowwwww... don't force it anywhere, always DIRECT and let it move on it's own. It's kinda like dancing. You don't TRY to dance and you look like a fool when you force it - you just gotta go with it!<br />

   Nope. I've heard of this method before... where do you guys get this information from? I'd like to see the site or book. I've also heard of rubbing your hands together for 30 seconds or something... I prefer to stick to mental stuff and leave the physical stuff out of it. It's always fun trying different things...

   <br />
   Sometimes. Sometimes I do it after deep relaxation, sometimes I do it when I feel energized. Mood affects the psi ball; being relaxed creates one kind of psi ball. Of course, with practice, you can make yourself feel a certain way. Then you can create excited psi balls being in a relaxed mood. I'm kinda close to
   that but I got some work to do <img src="smile.gif"

   Of course a scattered mind won't be able to focus the energy... you should be concentrated on making the psi ball and that's it. Like I said, mood affects the psi ball - a wandering mind will make the energy wander (in a sense <img src="smile.gif"

   Yup. Some days I try to create a psi ball and just totally screw up and can't get anywhere. Just like baseball players sometimes strike out every time in a game, we sometimes "strike out" when making psi balls. Don't worry... it's nothing major. Get worried when you have an "off month" or an "off year" <img src=

   <br />
   Visualize it getting smaller... but not weaker. Imagine it getting denser. I usually don't compress the psi ball that much, when I add energy to it I just shove it in the small area and don't even think about making the psi ball bigger. Therefore, it gets denser without me having to do extra work.<br />

   Keep absorbing energy and keep directing it into your hands. Some people move their hands further apart and make it bigger, then compress it down, some just make it denser. Do whatever you like...<br />

   Maintain concentration. You can also put an energy barrier around it - to seal it in. Then you can let it go and it should stay intact as long as the barrier holds.<br />

   <br />
   Visualize it moving and coming out of your hands. It depends how you absorb it too... if you think of yourself as a container - holding the energy inside of you - you have to make an opening at your hands. If you think of the energy flowing around you (that's what I do) then you just direct it around your body and
   have it gather in your hands.<br />
