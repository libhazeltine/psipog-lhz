         <p><em>by Peebrain</em></p>

         <p>This article is the most complete/detailed description of the method I use to create psi balls. I tried to write this article for a 3 year old so no one would be confused. Forgive me for being redundant and stupid in many parts, but I just wanted to make sure I covered everything <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />. Also, it's written for beginners - I'm not gonna tell you how to throw or add information to them. Here it is, a complete, step-by-step procedure, for making psi balls.</p>

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 1</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Decide where to make the psi ball</span><br /></p>

         <p>Before you make the psi ball, you have to decide where to make it. You can make it anywhere you want. You can make it in your hands, at your third eye, across the room, or in china!<br />
         <br /></p>

         <center>
            <img src="artimg/targets.gif"
                    width="384"
                    height="347"
                    border="0"
                    alt="Targets" />
         </center><br />
         The point is... it can be anywhere. Most people choose their hands. If you are choosing your hands, there are a couple positions you can put them in. Here is a picture of 3 that I use:<br />
         <br />

         <center>
            <table border="1">
               <tr>
                  <td><img src="artimg/hands.gif"
                       width="400"
                       height="113"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Hands" /></td>
               </tr>
            </table>
         </center><br />
         You can make your own positions or use these. It doesn't matter. Once you figure out where your going to make it and get in the correct position, you can move onto step 2.

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 2</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Decide your source of energy</span><br /></p>

         <p>Most people use energy from somewhere else to make a psi ball. You can use your energy, but you will run out faster and get tired. You can use anything as your source of energy. For example, you can use the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, or you can use people or objects. Usually planets/stars/moons are a good
         choice because they have a lot of energy.<br />
         <br /></p>

         <center>
            <table border="1">
               <tr>
                  <td><img src="artimg/source.gif"
                       width="530"
                       height="235"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Sources" /></td>
               </tr>
            </table>
         </center><br />
         Personally, I choose the Sun when I want to make a hot psi ball just because thinking of the Sun makes me think of being hot. I choose the Moon for cold psi balls because the Moon is usually dark and makes me think of cold. Overall though, I choose the Earth because it's close and it doesn't make me think of
         a specific temperature. You can choose ANYTHING as your source. Once you make a decision, you can move to step 3.

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 3</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Start drawing energy from your source</span><br /></p>

         <p>Drawing energy from your source is easy. All you have to do is visualize energy coming from your source and entering or surrounding your body. Visualizing is just like imagining or pretending, just picture it in your head. You can visualize anything you want, as long as it seems like your absorbing energy
         from the source. Some people close their eyes, some don't - do both and see what works for you. For example, I visualize myself standing on the Earth with energy coming from the core, through the ground, and into my body through my feet.<br />
         <br /></p>

         <center>
            <img src="artimg/drawing.gif"
                    width="163"
                    height="210"
                    border="0"
                    alt="Drawing Animation" />
         </center><br />
         Please keep in mind, this is just an example... you can imagine anything you want. Here's some ideas I just came up with:

         <ul>
            <li>Your source has an outlet and you "plug" into it and get energy</li>

            <li>Your source is above you and a water-fall is flowing over you, coming from the source</li>

            <li>Your source is above you and is acting like a cloud, shooting lightning bolts of energy into you</li>

            <li>Your source is feeding you hunks of energy, which you eat</li>
         </ul>As you can see, anything will work. Once you draw energy from your source and you get a constant flow (could take seconds, could take minutes) you can move onto step 4.

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 4</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Direct the energy inside your body to the location you're making the psi ball</span><br /></p>

         <p>Now, while still drawing energy from your source, direct the energy to where you're making the psi ball. Once it gets to the location, visualize the energy swirling around in the shape of a ball. For example, I visualize the energy twisting around my arms and swirling around in my hands.<br />
         <br /></p>

         <center>
            <img src="artimg/handsani.gif"
                    width="370"
                    height="220"
                    border="0"
                    alt="Hand Animation" />
         </center><br />
         Of course, this isn't exactly what I visualize, but I didn't want to spend hours and hours making an animation. Some tips while your doing this - when you imagine the energy moving, imagine yourself feeling it move. Also, imagine hearing it to. Try using as many senses as possible, if you pretend to feel it,
         hear it, and see it, then the visualization is stronger. Congratulations! You're making a psi ball!

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 5</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Adding more energy to the psi ball</span><br /></p>

         <p>To add energy, you just keep visualizing the energy entering the psi ball. There are two ways though... one, you could make the psi ball get bigger then compress it down, or two, you can make the psi ball denser and leave the size the same. If you're going to make the psi ball bigger, I suggest moving your
         hands apart then bring them closer together when you compress the ball. Note - you are <b>not</b> compressing the psi ball with your hands, you have to visualize it. Here is an example:<br />
         <br /></p>

         <center>
            <img src="artimg/grow.gif"
                    width="300"
                    height="270"
                    border="0"
                    alt="Growing Animation" />
         </center><br />
         Personally, I do it the other way - leave the psi ball the same, just make it denser. Here is what you could visualize:<br />
         <br />

         <center>
            <img src="artimg/dense.gif"
                    width="173"
                    height="209"
                    border="0"
                    alt="Dense Animation" />
         </center><br />
         And that's how you add more energy to your psi ball! Yippee <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />!!!

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Step 6</span><br />
         <span style="font-size: 110%;">Letting your psi ball go... *sniff*</span><br /></p>

         <p>Well, when it's time to get rid of the psi ball, all you have to do is let it go. That's it. Hopefully you haven't grown too attached to it <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />... So, when it's time, release your hold and let the energy filter into the air. Just let it diffuse... and that's it!</p>

         <p><span style="font-size: 120%;">Conclusion</span><br /></p>

         <p>Well, you made it. Congratulations! See, it's not that tough... this is easy stuff. If you have questions, I suggest looking at my "Questions and Answers" article in the Manipulation category because I answered A LOT of questions there. Right now I'm gonna take a break, maybe in the near future I'll write
         an article of how to throw them and how to change their color or something... OR maybe one of you will write it for me <img src="smile.gif"
              width="12"
              height="12"
              border="0"
              alt="Smile"
              class="smileyImg" />! Anyways... good luck and KEEP PRACTICING!!!</p>
