                  I'm new here and I've found your chat area but I can't seem to find any message boards on this site. Are there any message boards here or is there another site where PsiPog people are posting?</p>

                  <p>First of all GREAT SITE!</p>

                  <p>Anyway moving on.<br />
                  When I try to connect to the PsiPog chat client, nothing happens. I open the client and press the lightning symbol, and it says "*** Connecting to United States: tuath.ny.us.darkmyst.org (6667)..." then almost instantly it says "*** Connected. Initializing..." then I wait and wait and nothing ever
                  happens. When I try typing in the text field it displays " *** Please wait until the client has connected to the server completely." So I wait some more and I move on to other things occasionally looking back at it. Then I realize its been 2 hours and nothing. What's wrong?</p>

                  <p>I don't know... I have mixed feelings about it.</p>

                  <p>1. It requires a teacher. And teaching something like that is VERY time consuming.</p>

                  <p>2. Classes benefit only a small group of people. If a log is posted online, it helps more people, but sometimes that's a conflict of interest for the teacher.</p>

                  <p>3. Choosing students is always a pain in the ass. People get pissed because they aren't "chosen", and all that junk.</p>

                  <p>But, 4. It really helps that group of chosen students.</p>

                  <p>I don't know if it's a fair trade. Whenever I think about it, I always think: maybe my time would be better spent on writing more articles, and answering the Q&amp;A, where EVERYONE can benefit. We have over 1000 hits a day... teaching a group of 30 students doesn't seem like it's worth it in the
                  long run.</p>

                  <p>Hey everybody.</p>

                  <p>I sent in a French translation quite some time ago of Yumper's article, "Ways to Build your Psionic Abilities". And I mean quite some time ago. Probably about March. Anyway, do you know what happened to it? I spent a lot of time on it, and I wondered if it ever actually got read or used by
                  anyone.</p>

                  <p>And is the translation project still going on? I would very much like to do some more translations if they're needed.</p>

                  <p>Thanks,</p>

                  <p>The problem is that there really isn't enough people to work on everything, so we decided to put the translation project on hold until some time is freed up. We'll still take submissions, but we can't actively keep up with it.</p>

                  <p>I would suggest just holding off on the translations until we're ready again - we'll have an announcement whenever that is. Thanks for your support <img src="smile.gif"
