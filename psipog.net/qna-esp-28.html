                  <p>Hi.<br />
                  I have a question to ask.<br />
                  when i extend my field, I focus on a person, and everything he/she says or does, echoes in my mind about 1-2 seconds before she/he's actually doing it. And when i look at TV with my field over it, I receive images and sound from it before it's appearing on TV, about 1/2-1 seconds before.<br />
                  What is this?</p>

It's usually not that hard to predict what will happen in 1/2-1 second... in one second I will be typing this response... and what do you know, I am! But I think I understand what you're saying... If you are doing something with ESP,
                       maybe you can try to enhance it a little. Go for two seconds, go for five seconds, go for one minute, etc... I know personally, I like to use the "predict stuff that'll happen in a second" in sports to kind of "cheat" <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>I'm a natural empath and have no shields up. I've been having just to plough right through the emotions for as long as I can remember. I'm constantly having mood swings around certain people, and it's ruining my life. I'm starting to become suicidal.<br />
                  The reason that I haven't put up shields is that when I start practicing putting up basic shields I feel like i'm just trapping the mixed emotions.<br />
                  I desperately need to know if there is anyway to kind of 'wash away'the empathic signals for a period of time, allowing me to put up shields.<br />
                  Or, if I put up a shield for blocking empathic signals, will the remaining emotions just dissipate?<br />
                  As I said, I'm starting to get suicidal.</p>

                  <p>I know it sounds stupid, and it will _look_ even more stupid, but shake a rattle all around your body, about four inches, or ten centimetres, from your skin. A baby-rattle is ideal, but rain-sticks, any of the "shaker" kind of percussion instrument, or even some pieces of dry rice in a plastic
                  margarine tub will get the job done.</p>

                  <p>After you've done that -- preferably where no one saw you, because it looks really, really stupid -- "ground" while using a visualisation of a shower to direct the excess emotions, as well as any excess "psi stuff" into the earth/ground/dirt/floor/desktop....anything inanimate and connected
                  somehow to the ground will do. Don't "ground" into your dog. It isn't good for her.</p>

                  <p>If you feel like going the extra step, also make a little construct curry-comb, and brush your field, as though currying a horse.</p>

                  <p>Ok, I'm Really, Really bad at actually duplicating my experiences at will, even with the help of your articles. But, I have had one experience that left me, lets say in 'shock'. And I am wondering if I am alone in this experience. ~ A guy I had just met suddenly created a link ( I think) with me
                  and all of our though and memories collided for about an hour. During this hour we talked both mentally and physically, in pictures and in emotions. I couldn?t hide any of my memories and nether could he. I felt kind of naked afterwards. Has this ever happened to anyone else?</p>

                  <p>Yes, it has. Telepathic linking is an intimate activity. The "naked" feeling is entirely normal in those conditions. The fact that it happened as rapidly as it did with that person is not so common, but it _does_ happen.</p>

                  <p>Yes. It is equally possible to "project" yourself to other places you've never visited. The less you know about the place, the easier it will be to confirm whether your data was accurate, or whether it was just memory and imagination, later on when you check to see what it _really_ is like.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>1)In an area such as telepathy and all, how exactly would you practice by yourself? I mean if you were going to try to start sending, but you have no one to send to how would you practice? I have this dillema and I'm not sure how to go about with training in this manner.</p>

                  <p>2) Last night, I was attempting to make a link with someone right? Well the link itself seemed to be going okay and I recognized the whole "feeling the other person inside you" thing. Now even though I'm not the best at recognizing others signatures, I could tell it was hers (which could you give
                  me some tips on that by the way?) Back to the real point though. When I was finishing the link I had this sort of satisfied feel, but suddenly that changed and it felt as if someone was trying pull me out of bed! It was like I could feel a force pulling me toward it, but it wasn't like a physical
                  force because I could still "feel" my body laying down. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! Thanks in advance. :)</p>

                  <p>1) You cannot practice telepathy, per se, by yourself. By definition, telepathy requires two or more minds. However, you _can_ practice some of the related skills which would increase your chances of success when you get a chance to practice with a partner or in a game in a chatroom. For example,
                  you could practice maintaining complex visualisations (mental video games, et al). And you can practice pulsing psi at a target. Make the pulses very tightly pointed, and aim 'em at your psiwheel....</p>

                  <p>2) Insufficient data. What _might_ have happened was that her mind tried to re-establish the contact with yours, or the separation wasn't complete the first time.</p>

I mean I was naturally born with it, so I decided to see if I can advance, but all the people I know are too lazy and very non-supportive, so basically I have no one to talk to about it or practice
