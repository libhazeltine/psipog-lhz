                  <p>Ok the primary thing that's coming up is, is there anything anyone else has recorded/done/told about somewhere showing that you could temporarily elevate energy/psi levels? If so with that does anyone have an idea what happens when you do that? That's basically the big question for what I'm doing,
                  its hard to progress in the practice/research only knowing that it works, not knowing even a vague idea of "how" it works. I don't want or really expect hardcore science, but it would really help if I had some theoretical idea of what's going on.</p>

                  <p>Actually, yes. Sometiems during a telekinesis practice, or during a construct practice, you may need an extra 'burst of energy'. Many people acheive this through a technique known as biofeeedback. Psi is a byproduct created by the nervous system (as far as we can tell), and by artificially
                  stimulating your nerves, it releases an amount of psi (although continuous use becomes counter-productive). Look up more information about biofeedback.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have a theory about how psionics works overall. I believe that the key is the electrical energy within the human body. Whenever there is a thought, there is an electrical impulse that runs through the brain. I believe that this electrical energy somehow manipulates psi, leading to all psionic
                  abilities. The reason people must first be able to communicate with their subconscious is because the subconscious is the part of the brain that controls this energy.<br />
                  To give an example of how my theory works, take telepathy. When one creates a link, they connect their mind with someone else's using that electrical energy and psi to establish it. So, when one reads the other's mind, those same electrical impulses that run through one's mind runs through the other.
                  And when one controls the other through telepathy, they cause specific electrical impulses, leading to unwanted actions and so on and so forth.<br />
                  Now, do you believe that this theory is plausible? I heard about humans emitting an electrical aura and that electrical impulses were the cause of thought, so this is a thoery I created based on those facts.</p>

                  <p>Sounds like an idea. Now think to yourself: How can I test to see whether this theory is accurate or not? If you are suggesting that electricity plays an important role, what devices could you use to measure the electricity? Would the devices show more "activity" during telepathy, or other psi
                  related skills? And if the devices show "activity", could there be other explainations other than the electricity theory? Always remember - you should be searching for truth, and NOT searching for ways reality conforms to your theory. Reality creates theories, not the other way around <img src=

                  <p>... do you have any evidence to support that theory? I've read evidence that it ISN'T electromagnetic waves... My personal belief is that "PSI" is a group of a lot of different mechanisms (not just ONE thing). *shrug*</p>

                  <p>For what I'm doing I got a string of questions starting to pop up and the information I need isn't here :\ Is there a site or a person (someone I can talk to in the chat perferabbly) that covers knowledge on energy levels (altering them, the rate psi/energy/whatever recovers after expending a lot
                  of yourself, stuff like that) Sorry for being a bit vague in a couple places, since it says to ask one question I thought it better to inquire about where to find the answers rather than sumbitting a lot of questions.</p>

                  <p>Several countries have been doing research into the uses of psionics for military and espionage purposes, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the former Soviet Union (I'd be surprised if Russia stopped such research, but I do not have current data about such). You'll find that
                  governments tend to keep their military and espionage research secret.</p>

                  <p>Psionic effects were noticed during research into hypnosis and mesmerism, a couple hundred years ago. That was not the first time the effects were noticed, by any stretch of the imagination, but they weren't regarded as "magic" in that context. The designation as "psi" is an Americanism, from the
                  mid-20th century.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Potassium is required for the function of your nervous system, as is salt, and glucose (a simple sugar). Most psionic activities deplete the levels of potassium and sugar in the blood, and in fact, any intense mental activity will do this. If these levels drop too far, or too fast, you will become
                  very sick very fast, and it _can_ kill you. Such foods as orange juice and bananas have lots of potassium and sugar, and are popular ways to restore the blood-glucose and blood-potassium levels because they are digested quickly. Too much potassium can kill you as quickly as too little, so stick with
                  safe methods of taking it in, such as eating fruits, veggies, and milk products.</p>
