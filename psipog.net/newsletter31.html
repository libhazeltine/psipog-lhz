Newsletter #31, for June 1, 2006

Dear PsiPog Users,

Recently Apollo has been revamping his site:
http://www.freewebs.com/psilinks/
You can periodically check it for everything you need on
information overload on psi. Also enjoying the long write ups
from you guys, it adds content to the newsletter, and saves me
time if I find myself busy at night, I feel better when I see
that there is going to be something I can plug in. so keep up
the good work, and keep the questions and such coming. And as
you all noticed, the newsletter has changed schedule from
just every two weeks to the 1st and 15th, this way it is easier
for me to keep up with.

=================================================================

Last week's Activity
This activity came from Azric and is as follows:

I have an idea for a game involving pinging. It is a simple
game to play with psions that are in your area. Let's say that
2 psions are in a room together, one is the 'pinger' person
performing the ping, and the 'pingee' is the person reciving
the ping. This is to be done at random times & intervals. For
arguments sake, lets say it is in a classroom, where you want
to keep your psionics a secret, its fun and well, I believe
discreet is the word I would like to use here. The pinger
sends a loud noise or some form of distraction to the pingee,
upon recieving the ping, the pingee looks toward the pinger.
If the pinger HAS sent a ping, they simply mouth the word ping.
Then, to prove that the pingee has actually recieved a ping,
or just looked up coincidently, they nod or shake their head
in correspondance.


=================================================================

Activity #5:

This time every take time upon going to sleep to try and
achieve and OBE. It is as simple as laying there till you feel
yourself drifiting off to sleep, and you are having brief
flashes of daydreams/minidreams. When this happens, try to
keep your mind awake while still experiencing what is happening
naturally. Once you feel ready(should be slight vibrations, or
a semi-detatched feeling from your body) to, try and focus on a
particular part of your body, and try and feel it moving out
and above your body. For a longer, and more understandable
reference go here : art-outline-to-shielding.html168


=================================================================
This was sent in by Obsidian, a handy idea to keeping clean of
excess buildup :

Keeping clean

It happens to all of us, you make a construct, and then after
practice it has no purpose. My point when I say this is that
something you all should know is that psi tends to accumulate
in places, usually as residual energy or as fragmented
constructs. My opinion as to why this happens is that you
program it to stay together.

Okay, so lets cut to the point, residual energy can be good or
bad. If you just want to make a quick psiball, you can use it.
As a matter of fact it can be used as a reservoir, however
unlike a reservoir it doesn't stay put, it can cause
interference in random ways, and some effects it can cause
include anxiety and malfunctioning electronics (you cant
ALWAYS blame windows :P ).

Now to "cleanse your field" you can simply wave your hand
around concentrating yourself on making it act sort of like
psi-glue, globing together any psi that wouldn't be there if
there weren't direct (or indirect) interference by a person,
but also you might not be able to do this. So another
technique would be making a psi-garbage ball, then make
it dissipate. All that I've said is ideal for fragmented
constructs, if its just residual energy you can easily ground
it. After this is done the room should feel different, try
practicing psi now and you might notice the difference.


Also, some might not want to dissipate whole or fragmented
constructs, you might find some random use for them, and you
might even find one with emotional value to you (I once found
my old Pac-man I spent an entire night playing with). You might
want to keep it in a corner or something, but I advise that
if you want to do this try shelling it to make sure it doesn't
dissipate by itself, program the shell to feed off you or
some other source, but don't forget about it since that
wouldn't be a healthy thing to do :P. Same goes for residual
energy, its good for making something quick since its right
there and its already been manipulated by you. Do the same
and shell it, you can program the shell to feed off you or
better yet the residual energy itself. This way you don't
have to worry about forgetting it or making shields that are
compatible with it, besides, better it than you, and it will
eventually consume itself anyways. As a matter of fact shelling
energy is a very good idea, sometimes when you have to ground
its better to do this, and its also good practice.

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================

Austin suggests:
I recently have taken up meditating (or maybe it's
self-hypnosis?) Either way, it really helps to calm yourself,
and clear your mind, and purify your energy. That's about the
best I can describe it.

What I do is I sit in the quietest place possible, place my
hands on my knees and sit comfortably in a crossed-leg
position. I close my eyes (to keep sensory input to a minimum)
and focus on trying to expand my mind. I don't understand how
this works, but I know that once you are meditating fully,
you feel almost as if you are weightless, in a large spherical
area, floating in the center. It feels as if there is a vast
space around you.

At this point, I begin to make subtle (or not-so-subtle)
changes to my mind and my mood. I tend to picture everything
as threads tied to me. In one hand I have a knife and in the
other I have a loop of more thread. If I want to eat, there
is a thread tied to me that also ties me to food. If I want
to remove that want, I slice it off with the knife. If I want
to create a desire, I simply reach out and tie the imaginary
thread to whatever it is I want to do.

Using this technique (I have only been able to do it very
effectively once) I was able to finish a large homework
assignment very quickly by focusing my desires on that one
thing. It also seems to help to have just exercised before
doing this because you will be out of breath and as you focus
on slowing your breathing down, your mind will calm and
quickly slip into a state of meditation.

This could probably be used in conjunction with a lot of
psionic stuff.


My Comments: This seems like a very good visualization for
meditation, and while not everyone may get the same results
from your technique, it certainly seems to be doing well for
you so far. Although I wouldn't advise too much on trying
to master hunger with a simple meditation technique, but for
something such as finishing homework or achieving a certain
state for later practice it seems to work well.

lttlpo asks:
I am new to psychokinesis. but I am willing to learn. Like most
people I would like to integrate my own ways into performing
psychokinesis. however, I am having difficulty. I have already
made a psiball, but thats all I can do. I am positive its there
since I feel the energy, but when I try to program it, it does
nothing. This may be that I am poor at visualizing. Maybe you
could write some exercizes of how to better enhance your
visualization. Thank you.

My Comments: Well first off, I think some people try and make
it harder than it is to begin with. If you can make a psiball,
and move energy than you are more than halfway there to
programming it. This is because when you program it, you are
telling it what actions to perform in the same manner you moved
it to get a psiball in the first place. Visualization is not
as hard as it may sound either. Take for instance, if I told
you to think of an apple, you are probably going to see an
apple in your imagination/head/thoughts, whatever you refer to
it as. Programming a construct with visualization is simply
seeing what you want it to do in your head, and then letting
it happen. It may help if you imagine sending this idea to
the construct you are programming as a packet of energy, but
this is up to what works for you.

Benjamin wonders:
Yesterday I started practicing Telekinesis, this evening it
worked. I felt something special. It was very strange, but I
want to get more advanced. And I'm worried it won't work
anymore. Please give me some advice on how I can get better
and how to do it actually (because I really don't know how I
did it, it was like a band between me and the paper...?).

My comments: Well first off, If you have read the articles on
Psipog and you are still confused, I'm not sure how much help
I can offer as I learned over half of the stuff I do now from
them. But I'll give it a try. First off, the whole concept of
linking to me seems to throw people in the first place. You
don't need some kind of equivalent of a telepathic link, you
just simply need to be aware of its existence, and the state
it is currently in. After you get the feel for this, you can
try and spin it, and see what it feels like when it is
spinning. Then when it slows down, simply recreate the feeling
you felt while it was spinning. If it helps, try and overlap
the feeling you get, and the visualization of of the object
spinning in your mind. If all goes well, you should be on your
way to TK in no time. If you need further help sensing things
try out this article : art-psiball-source.html7

Anonymous says:

Okay, I made a psi ball. I couldn't make one at first,
but then I LET the energy flow; it worked. I think
that instead of doing psionics, we allow ourselves do
it.

What about intent? We have articles, but not
specifically on intent. So, can you tell me about it?

I made a new Macro Pk test. First, you set one of those
little styrofoam balls on a blank sheet of paper. The
you draw a tight circle around it. Then, you try to
move the ball out of the circle.

My Comments: Well if we allow ourselves to do something, we are
still participating in the act of doing it, so while I get your
point, allowing yourself to do something stills mean you are
doing it.

I am not sure exactly what you mean by intent, but I would see
anything you do in psionics would require a certain amount of
intent to get a certain task done without having something else
happen. I not sure how much one could write on intent, other
than : Yes it is required unless you want random results. How
else would you know what you wanted to accomplish, and whether
you got the results you wanted? I can clump psi together, but
if I start with the intent to make a psi-ball, I have the
pre-formed notion, and more than likely am going to visualize
a psi-ball to start with. Now if you are talking about
replacing visualization with intent, that is a matter of
personal opinion, and is up to whatever works best for you.


This would be a good idea for those who often mention seeing
small shifts in the object, but not sure if it actually moved
or if it was their eyes playing tricks on them. Some could
also use it as a personal goal for distance, or as you said
a game of sorts.
