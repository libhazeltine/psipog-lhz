                  <p>I've been trying to develop telepathy for the last month, but i still dont know what a psi sig is. is it a feeling or a thought that reminds you of the person you are trying to read the mind of.(such as, his/her name, voice, etc.)</p>

                  <p>Yeah, you have the right idea. It's the concept of the person you can use to target them. What DEFINES that person to you? It might be helpful to list qualities like you did, to help pinpoint it. After some time, you can get a "feel" for a person, and don't have to list every little detail. This
                  usually happens with people you practice telepathy with for a while.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello, I've made questions before, but now i think i have a more interesting inquiry. I've all ways had great success with intuition and empathy. Now i'm having a rather interesting manifestation. A few months ago i was walking to my car ond had an image pop into my head. I stopped and try to
                  sense more of the feeling and sight that i got but couldn't. when i returned, i got it again at the same spot. i walked around the spot several times then suddenly i saw clearly, a large object in my mind, a big boulder. then i realized that i was standing on the top of the boulder, with only the top
                  of it out of the ground. well soon i started being able to actually sense the entirity of an object in my mind. i've developed it some but i still can't figure out exactly how to classify it. but the most interesting part is that i can actually see and feel imperfecions or weak spots in an object,
                  like a rock or tree. Tell me, have you heard of such? (sorry, i cant write very interestingly) psionguy</p>

                  <p>Yes, I've heard of it, and generally, it is called 'sensing' or 'divining'. If you are more interested in this effect and training it, I encourage you to read the Sensitivity Manual written by Gnome, as it includes such effects, if you practice them.</p>

                  <p>OK, quick question. I read a few of the articles already, and it said it was possible to send images to other people. I was wondering if it was possible to do the same with dreams, like if somebody was asleep, could you establish a Link with them, and see what they are dreaming?</p>

                  It mostly happens to me that, in a dream, I wish for something to be and when it comes true, it does that in a very specific way (shape, emotions ect.)<br />
                  Should I interpert those as hints from my subconsciousness as how I am supposed to help it understand what I want? (for example the shape and emotions I get when I summon "energy" in such a dream)</p>

                  <p>ok, ehere's the thing...i think im an "empath" if thats the term...if there is a term, well, lets just say i sense peoples feelings VERY accurately, to the point that i can feel them too, now, i was wondering two things:<br />
                  1.Is this feeling sensing thing psychic?<br />
                  2.can i use my emotions to..."charge" or help my telekinesis?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Sensing people's feelings can often be attribted to being able to read facial expressions. If you know that that is not the case, then yes, it probably is a psychic feeling. Try to see if you can feel your targets' emotions prior to walking into the room or seeing them. If it still works, this is
                  a much more sure sign.</p>

                  <p>As far as using emotions to charge psychokinesis, NI devoted a few paragraphs to it in his Second Telekinesis Manual:</p>

                  <p>since a small child, i have had the ability to sense, literally if someone is good or bad, if someones good then i feel good, but someties when someones bad i feel literally sick, i cant be with that person, its like my body says not to be with that perticular person, its really good to have it
                  cause it helps me in life to sort out peopple from good and bad, but my question is, what is it, is it empathy or something else, do you have any advice</p>

                  <p>If this is indeed a psychic skill (and not something that you consciously tell based on actions, body laniguage, speech patterns, ect.), then it would probably be along the lines of telepathy. Many times personality types are built stronger into people than just their surface-thoughts, and are
                  easier to get a sense of.</p>

                  <p>As far as feeling 'good' or feeling 'sick' around the person, that is more of a conscious of the sub-conscience sense, and shouldn't hang around or longer than a few minutes. If you are feeling sick often, I advise seeing a doctor.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Oftentimes the thought that you send to a person is not consciously perceived as though it was by a psion, please allow me to give an example:</p>

                  <p>Psion-to-Psion: *sends* "blue square" "wow, I got a blue square, from you"</p>

                  <p>Psion-to-NonPsion: *sends*"blue square" "hmm, why did I think of a blue square"</p>

                  <p>Although certain thoughts are more perceived than others. IF you were walking along and a blue square came into your thoughts, you would think nothing of it and continue your activity. However, if the sending was along the lines of "call Bill" the non-psion may have a sudden thought of Bill, or
                  desire to call him.</p>

                  <p>The emotions/thoughts that are sent are not perceived on the conscious level (most of the time), but instead manifest themselves on the sub-conscious level when sent to someone not trained for receiving telepathic/empathic messages.</p>

                  <p>Well, this might not sound very clear, because im not great at explaining, but. A while ago, i was talking to my mum, and i decided to ask if she had liked the film we watched the other night, which was Shrek, she then, not 5 seconds later comes out with "That shrek was good, wasnt it?" other
                  instances like this include things like when i'll be talking to my friends and ill think of something randomly and one of them will say something about the random subject i thought of. Do you think this could be Precog or Telpathic Broadcasting?</p>

                  <p>Also, i seem to have an overwhelming sense of Deja Vu, a lot more than i used to, now ill have at least one instance where i remember being in a situation exactly the same, each month, whereas before it was incredibly rare.</p>

                  <p>I think that the best answer to this question is to test it and see. Frankly, it could be coincidence, or either one. To try to prove one way or another, experiment. Try to predict what people will say in those types of situations, recording your results. Then try to broadcast your thoughts, and
                  record the results. Finally, see what happens if you are trying both (still recording results). It may be one, the other, or a mix between the two. However, if you try good ol' "try and see" you should be able to determine the nature of the phenomenon.</p>

                  <p>Dear Authors of this site, I would like to know what SunTzu exactly means by shifting perception in his article on Trancing. pleas give me an explanation of this notion.<br />
                  I followed his suggestion to listen to trance music and I began to feel a relatively strong pressure in my third eye region, beginning to see some colors and strange visions (physical eyes closed). Could this be a sign or symptom for trance? And now my questions:<br />
                  -What initial signs or symptoms are typical for a trance state? -What does he mean by ?try to see the world from a space just behind your eyes?? Does he mean, I shall close my eyes and try to see or pretend to see all objects in my current environment (which is changing permanently, home, office,
                  etc.) and which I usually see with my physical eyes? Is this what he calls ?world? in this sentence?<br />
                  -Wher is this ?space behind your eyes?? Is this a special spot in the head?<br />
                  -Should I deem the light while doing this exercise? Pleas give me some advice for this exercise which seems to be important for activating the third eye. Many thanks in advance Koorosh</p>

Now, pretend that your eyes were located deeper back in your head (yes, I know it seems silly). What would you see then? Usually you would see some sort of blackness about your field of
                  vision, as if you were looking through a tunnel at the world.</p>

                  <p>I don't know specifically why this works or doesn't for some people. However, it seems to be related to the "decending meditation" in that you get deeper and deeper into the trance as you do this. For me, it usually 'jump-starts' the trance, and throws me into a trance fairly rapidly.</p>
