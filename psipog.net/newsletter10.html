PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance

Newsletter #10, for January 18th, 2005

"Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no
loss of enthusiasm."
- Winston Churchill


Dear PsiPog Users,

Alllright :-). We have a BUNCH of new mail, so I'll try to get
through the majority of it. Welcome to all the new memebrs of
the newsletter - I hope you find these useful and interesting.
They go out every other tuesday, and I try to fill it with things
people have e-mailed me with. If you want to send in a comment,
question, suggestion, weblink, complaint, whatever - send it to:
newsletter@psipog.net

To read all previous newsletters, visit:

What updates are going on at PsiPog.net? Well hmmm... I fixed
the Search page finally, and I also updated the layout of the
"Login" pop up thingy. Any new articles? Kind of... there are
always a large group of "in progress" things, and every once in
a while a random one goes from "in progress" to finally
"finished". I don't have any specific articles that I think will
be finished soon, but I do have a large bank of "in progress"
articles that could cross over soon.

OH YEAH! Don't forget to check out the new video in the Media
section from Float. It's so cool - watch and drool :-P.

Alright, enough boring chit chat, let's get into the mail bag:

"I was just searching the web lately last night, and I came upon
a pretty cool online book on OOBE's. It's very much like Robert
A. Monroe's Book 'Journeys Out of the Body' (which I thank you
for suggesting in the ebook). The guys name is Robert Peterson.
Well here's the book: http://www.robertpeterson.org/obebook.html
I just thought it might be interesting to some one out there. In
it, it gives a pretty good detailed instruction on a technique to
have an OOB, with some pictures exampling how to do it. At the
end it even goes into some other things that occured in his OBE's
like Telepathy and Empathy."

My comments: Yes! I love that book, and I even put the link in
the Links section of PsiPog :-P. I figured I would include this
here because I bet a lot of people overlook the links and wanted
to give everyone a heads up :-P. It's a great book, and it's
helped me in many ways. Good recommendation :-).

"Okay if your body produces PSI and you control the product that
YOUR body creates and control the creation of the object (PSI),
then would that not make energy manipulation, Bio-PK?"

My comments: Wouldn't that make moving your arm Bio-PK? It
depends on your definition of Bio-PK... A more common/scientific
term for Bio-PK is DMILS, which stands for Direct Mental
Interaction with Living Systems. Don't worry so much about
where to categorize things... Does it really matter if
controlling psi falls under the label of Bio-PK or not? It's
just a label. If you're curious about Bio-PK/DMILS, do a search
on google, or go to a library. Sometimes interesting studies are
categorized under just "Psychokinesis" that could apply to
Bio-PK, so don't be afraid to pick up a few books :-).

"Maybe instead of putting an elabourate chat in the site with
programs and everything you could just create a forum so that
people that arent frequently online can join in too. That way
people can just check in and read the stuff, post something and
check in a few days later and they could also get the opinions
of many more people."

My comments: I know that makes sense in theory... but I don't
think you understand the traffic PsiPog.net pulls. Back over a
year ago, we tried forums and were deleting 80 posts a day.
I believe people were posting between 200 and 300 a day. When
we try to do forums, they aren't the normal "check back every
once in a while" type of things - they are so active it's almost
equivalent to a chat. I do want to eventually try something that
can bring more people together, but I don't know if the "normal
forum" is a workable idea yet. I'll continue to think about it
and listen to ideas, and we'll see :-).

"I think a good idea for the site would be to start up the forum
again. I remember back when we had the old forum and that was a
great place to get some idea's and share thoughts. That was
great...until it took up all the bandwith :) Anyways i realize
that would be a tough thing to do because of the way psipog has
grown, but mabey we could find some alternate ways of hosting it
or something."

My comments: Perhaps. I'm thinking of opening up something like
www.psipog-forums.com or something to dedicate an entire server
to the forums. (No, that URL doesn't work yet, it's just an
idea :-P). It would cost a lot of money, time, and effort... so
right now it's just in the "maybe some day"-phase.

Greg writes:
"Me and my friend have been practicing psi for over a month now
and have been practicing psi and telepathy/empathy. A couple
nights ago as we were practicing we decided to try something new:
seeing people from a distance. I went first, as I had pioneered
this before, though it was in vain. I sought out the person's
face, and my scrying was accurate. We tested this on two other
people, one of which I couldn't find, so my technique is not
completely accurate.

Here's my procedure:

1. Meditate, self-center, clear your mind, whatever exercise you
prefer.

2. Imagine the person's face, and examine how you feel about that
person and how your mind detects that person. This is the
"signature" (in my opinion).

3. Relax and search for the person.

4. After searching, a picture will most likely pop or ease into
your head. It will most likely be the right person, but I've had
a few misses, so to speak.

5. The next time you talk to the person, ask if they did what you
saw."

My comments: I agree that in Step 2, you are finding their
signature. The hard part seems to be Step 3, which you didn't
elaborate that much on... let me see if I can describe what I
think you're talking about. (Correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll
post it in the next newsletter.) Close your eyes, and stay
relaxed. Keep their signature in your mind, and mentally "reach"
outwards (does that make sense? :-P). The goal is to find the
person - you can imprint this goal on your mind in a number of
ways. Personally, I just ask myself "where is joey at?". You
can try other things though, like just holding onto the feeling
of the question (and not verbalizing it), or you can try to
visualize a map with cross hairs searching for the location, or
you can try extending a part of your awareness out and feel for
the right direction to search in. After that, moving on to
Step 4 might make more sense - you'll probably get some pictures
popping into your head, or a "feel" for where the person is, or
you might "hear" a reply in your head, "joey is at the mall".
Try it out, and see if you're right :-).

j_w_b_1 asks:
"I play tp games with my sister (as i told you last time) and I'm
wondering is that just a kind of family link or is it telepathy
in general?"

My comments: I haven't really analyzed my personal differences
between family-telepathy, and random-person-telepathy. In some
ways, it's easier with a family member, and in some ways, it's
harder. For example, if I'm trying to read my sister, sometimes
my brain interrupts and says "well, your sister believes blah
blah and blah, therefore a logical conclusion is that your sister
is thinking blargh bleugh and blarck". And that can interrupt
the reception of what she really is thinking. I mean: my deeper
knowledge about her as a person can activate the "logic" in my
head to try and logically conclude what she "must" be thinking.
So with family members (for me at least), it's harder to shut off
this process, and just WAIT and LISTEN. When I try to read a
stranger, my logical brain doesn't have any information to
process yet, so it doesn't try to draw any conclusions and
interrupt.

However, when I do read them, I can read them very accurately.
Perhaps because it's a team effort between my psychic perception
of them, and my logical understanding of them as a person? I can
read a few things, and plug that information into my logical
brain, and spit out more interesting conclusions.

It's a good question - perhaps I'll stick that in the next poll
on PsiPog.net and see what others think about it (if I remember
to :-P).

=================================================================

Scott asks:
"Is it true that telekinesis is in everyone?"

My comments: Some people say yes, some people say no. Personally
I believe that anyone can do it. But it's sort of impossible to
prove either way, until we know what telekinesis actually IS.
Perhaps something in a person's genes trigger it, or enable it...
or perhaps it's just one of those things that come with being
human. Or maybe it's one of those things that come with
existing in general? I don't know. The only way to find out if
it can work for you is to try it out and see. There is no "pee
in a cup" test that we can do to see if you're capable :-P. Try
and find out!

"Ok, me and my friend invented a game we got from hide and
go-seek. For a good game you need at least 3 people plus your
self. This can be done in many ways but what we did is we made a
construct some where in a room. What you do is you have your
partners to leave the room so you can "hide" a construct some
where. You let your friends in and they must use their psi only
to find it and once everyone is done looking you tell them where
it really was. It works great and is a little challenging but fun
hope you like it."

My comments: Cool idea :-D.

flip357 writes:
"Well I just got done reading the latest newsletter and it got me
to thinking: I have this friend who puts up reverse sheilds. He
sheilds to keep his thoughts from being brodcasted out for other
people to pick up on. Well I was thinking that maybe I could put
a sheild up to keep my thoughts from being brodcasted during
things like a poker game so people could realy tell if I was
bluffing or anything else. I think about things like that
because I read people to try to get an edge in games like poker."

My comments: Good idea - it's possible for people who don't
practice psionics to pick up on things like that, so that makes
sense :-).

Tenwing_Faia writes:
"A long time ago, I was speaking with a psi-enthusiast I had met
at the Renaissance Faire. She suggested that psi powers are
'locked' and that those of us who study psi will come to a point
in our life when it will unlock. Of course, she had said, minor
feats would be attainable beforehand, but at a point in our life
(puberty, or around age eighteen) we will get a flow of power,
in which we can perform bigger tasks (if we have enough exercise
in control) or the smaller ones become a lot easier. She also
mentioned that where some people can't even do the little
experiments well, it is only that they have a tougher lock. All
in all, quite an interesting theory. I was wondering, what are
your thoughts are on this?"

My comments: Hmmm... I don't know if there is a "turning point"
in a psion's life where they notice an increase in "power". My
understanding is more of a gradual and punctual change type of
thing. By this I mean... I believe we make gradual changes
and advancements when we practice. Then every once in a while,
we can make a punctual change which is more sudden and noticable.
For example, if you practice telekinesis, you can sit around and
try to move the pinwheel all day and get no results. But you are
gradually getting better. Then one day, you get it to spin! And
bam, a punctual change. Now you gradually get better at the
pinwheel, and eventually get the balls to try to move something
harder like a pen. But you can't move the pen. So you keep
practicing, and gradually get better, until one day BAM - a
punctual change and now you can move the pen.

Maybe the person at the Renaissance Faire was thinking of one
specific punctual change... One idea that comes to mind is that
person might have been labelling the change from "psi might be
real", to "holy shit it really is REAL!". That is a big change
for a psion, and can change their outlook on psionics which could
increase their success. What do you think?

"In the last newsletter Ancheron had the idea of having a suit of
cards with an odd card mixed in and the challenge was to sense
the odd card. I'm going to have to try this.

I experienced a variation of this half an hour after the Flare
party finished. I was playing a shell game with my daughter we
had 2 brown six sided dice (from a backgammon set) and a red 12
sided dice, the challenge was to find the red 12 sided dice. I
found that when my hand was over the cup that contained the 12
sided dice it felt different, as though some pressure was
pressing against my palm. I went with the feeling on the first
game and won, noticed the feeling and ignored it on the second
game and lost then I realised what the feeling was and followed
the feeling in my hand and won every game. It was as though I
could feel the different shape that I was looking for.

This had never happened to me before, I think the concentration
required for the flare party was a real bonus."

My comments: Cool :-). Good idea for an exercise :-).

puggy2000 asks:
"I was wondering is it actually possible to be better at TK in a
crowd or small group of people, instead of a quiet lonely place?
Becuase I've noticed that my psiwheel moves A LOT more when
people are around. But now I think its the wind or something."

My comments: You have to watch out for wind - the psi wheel is
really sensative. I believe that a group of people can help
though - I've only done TK once in front of other people because
they wanted to see if I could. I was really nervous, and I
hadn't practiced in a really long time - but it ended up moving
despite my doubts. I think their enthusiasm helped me, and maybe
they played a part too because they wanted it to move as well.

"Hey there,
I got a tip for trancing using the how-to guide by SunTzu.

I've recently started DJing and with it, I have learned that the
beat bar (called a four to the floor bar or something like that)
has at least 4 counts. So, when you're listening to the music to
trance out, try and count 1, 2, 3, 4. Eventually (if you have
any ear for music) you'll catch where the beat starts, end and
how fast you have to count. So keep counting 1, 2, 3, 4 and you
can take out the beat bar, and take on more beats (if you want
an overload state) or keep focusing and counting 1, 2, 3, 4 on
that one beat bar.

Good luck with practice!"

My comments: Yep, those of us that play musical instruments can
pick up on that easily... For those musically challenged out
there, listen to ANY song and find a beat.

Oh goodness what a long newsletter :-P. Lots of people had sent
mail, so I try to get most letters in here. Thanks to everyone
for their questions, comments, and ideas! Keep 'em coming, and
I'll keep sending them out :-P.

See you in two weeks :-).
