                  <p>I actually read the article concerning communications with the subconscious and am fully aware that the subconscious communicates through feeling. However, I am curious if it is possible to actually hear my subconscious, as if it can talk to me. I have reason to believe that I've heard my
                  subconscious through the voices of people I've met, but also doubtful and can consider it just simply that I am recalling quotes and such.</p>

                  <p>In short, can your subconscious actually talk to you? And if so, would it make up a voice or would it use voices from memory.</p>

                  <p>Yes, it is possible to have a 'conversation' with your sub-conscious mind (with actual words), and as you become more sensitive to it, you hear the words more clearly. As to what the voice sounds like, I have never thought about it, but it doesn't seem like it is the voice of any people that I run
                  into often. *Shrug* hope this help</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>My subconscious always has the same "voice", but I've never really focused on what the voice was. It's the same as my internal dialog voice. I can tell when the voice changes though. For example, I've heard people I know (like friends and relatives) in my head, and their voices are very
                  distinct.</p>

                  <p>The subconscious _can_ do this. The results of one Kickball game are insufficient to say for certain whether it _did_ work, but it might have done so. It can. Tim Galloway's book _The Inner Game of Tennis_ might be of interest to you.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I had a wierd experience while trying OOB. I read this book "Wisdom of the Mystic Masters", an old book I found in my closet, I would actually recommend trying to get it online and read it or somthing. It tells you to practice seeing yourself somewhere else. I was in my room in the dark, laying on
                  the ground trying it, and I went to my friends across the street. I heard a voice say, "John!" and I jumped up, expecting my friend to come in. I waited and he did come in. He said, My door just opened by itself!" and I didnt tell him. I said, "did you call my name aloud when you walked into my
                  house?" and he said no. It was pretty trippy. it tells you how to really do it too. it says focus on your crown and then drift the consousness above you. I was going to bed one night, and I decided to try it. it felt like I was Vibrating and I got dizzy and jumped up fast. That was my first time
                  trying it, and I havent tried it again. The wierd thing was when I woke up, I didnt remember it until halfway through the day, and i faintly remembered it. I was playing a videogame and remembered the wierd vibration. I dont remeber If I was trying it, or I woke up in the middle of the night and
                  tried it. I only have a faint memory and I did it last night. I didnt actually come out of my body though. is it common to blank out? I read the vibration thing, so I know that is normal.</p>

                  <p>Another thing that keeps happening. The more and more I try this different stuff(Psi, telekinesis, ect.) I have like precognition effects. I sometimes say things on tv a few seconds before they happen in my head. also, my friend always has de ja vu (dont know how to spell it.)We also always think
                  of the same things at the same time. One of us will say somthing and the other would say, "I was just thinking about saying that!" It happens alot. Are we using telepathy? Am I experiencing Precognition? Thanks for your help (sorry if its long and if the questions were already asked :)) Thank you
                  again!</p>

                  <p>a) Yes, it is fairly normal.<br />
                  b) That could indeed be precognition, with the television incidents. The "saying/thinking the same thing" is a common form of minor telepathy. Or rather, it can be; this would depend on the conditions in which it happens. For example, if your Math teacher just asked the class "What is four plus
                  five?" and you both thought "Nine" at roughly the same time, that is unlikely to be telepathy.</p>

                  <p>Okay well the other night i tried to have an OBE and i got to the part where you put your body to sleep. So I worked from feet to my head and when i got to my abdomen/slash chest when i thought i felt pressure. So i stopped and i felt that my heart went up. NOte that i just got into Psi. Was it
                  good that i stopped or should i have been passive.</p>

                  <p>Due to this i decided to take a few days off from Psi, is that alright.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Stopping was the smart thing to do. If you aren't sure about something like that, it's _much_ safer to stop, ask some questions, and try it again later if you want to. If you ignore some of the warning signs, there is a good chance that you won't still be alive to try it again later.</p>

                  <p>That said...</p>

                  <p>In this particular case, you _probably_ would have been fine. There is a point during that activity when your pulse and breathing do speed up, without any problems. Better safe than sorry, though.</p>

                  <p>This isnt so much as a question as something i found that might be helpfull, and I cannot get the chat at the moment(long story) so here:</p>

                  <p>This is basically a variation on Rainsong's psi paintball game. Get a few friends, and, using gelatin-like force bubbles, play "tag" It is very amusing to be sitting in class (or work, what ever) and getting smacked in the face by a smaller force bubble. Usually, with an accompanying ping to say
                  who it's from. This is both fun and good practice and pinging and force bubbles. If there is anything to add, I would be happy to hear it in the (hopefull) reply.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've had this skill I've practiced since I was 10 years old. I'm 18 now, so it's been a long while since I've been doing. I attempted when I first joined this sight to master TK, and for a while I pushed myself an hour every night. However, my inability to do any more than just move it..i.e... I
                  could not control it's movement, eventually lead to dis-encouragement, and I stopped. Starting up again, I want to build on a strong point. I believe my strong point is this skill. This skill I have used only during sports in my gym, whenever I was on the sideline. I would imagine the person trying
                  to make the goal filled with a sea of blue lights, swirling around like the flow of water. Then I imagine a spearlike crystal formation jutting out of the ground, glowing red with disorder. I then visualize the lights locking up, vibrating, trying to be free. I can feel this struggle, but I make sure
                  to focus so that I feel them locked. I even imagine the player freezing still, even while he's still moving. This works around 90% of the time, in that the target player rarely succeeds when I do that. On the flip side, when I make my own team member glow blue (in my mind), along with the ball, and
                  the goal/basket, and everyone else red, it's like the player is godlike with an invincible will, and nothing red can interfere with the blue. This works around 70% of the time. In general..I focus , and the target focus either fails, or succeeds. I have no idea what skill this is, and in order to
                  build on it I need to categorize it so I can read other things from that category. Can anyone tell me what this skill falls under?</p>
