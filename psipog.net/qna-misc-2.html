                  <p>Yes, I've heard of him. I don't know him, personally, but someone whose opinion I respect does know him, and says that the fellow can do what he claims to do. Presuming this to be true, he is therefore a psion.</p>

                  <p>Anywhere that you want, you can move into TK with the intention of making force-bubbles. You can move into healing, or shielding, ot you can start a new direction with Remote Viewing or Clairvoyance (being that you probably already have some of the prerequisite sensitivity).</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The short answer is: nobody knows for sure. The activities of interest to many of the researchers are things such as mucking up computer systems, which is a relatively simple activity, and the perceptive effects (telepathy, precog, clairvoyance, psychometry). I've seen people lift couches, and I
                  personally have lifted a canoe (however, there were no witnesses to that event, and I have not duplicated it, so I do not actually expect anyone to believe it). There are psionicists who are much, _much_ more skilled than I will ever be. Have they done everything that _can_ be done? I doubt it.</p>

                  <p>All that said...yes, spinning paperclips is fun, but you don't need to stop there unless you want to.</p>

                  <p>Hello Sean. I am a noob to psioncs and I am loving it. I have the Psions Handbook and I practice everyday. I only have one question. You mention that in order to use empathy and telekinesis, you need a psi-sig. You gave a basic overview of how to get the psi-sig of someone, but I had a little
                  problem understanding what you meant. Can you give me a little more detailed explannation of how to get psi-sigs? My friend and i will literally thank you.</p>

                  <p>First: Check out that article.</p>

                  <p>Don't try to over-think what a psi-sig is. Just because we give it a bizarre name doesn't mean that it's difficult or anything. It's actually really simple.</p>

                  <p>If I tell you a story about a time I was walking through grass, with the smell of fresh flowers, right as the sun was about to rise... the breeze was blowing softly... blah blah blah. This long list of descriptions will trigger an EMOTION inside of you.</p>

                  <p>In the same sense - think about a person. List their qualities to yourself. "Mike is a little short, and really skinny. When he talks, he's very quick with his words, and uses short sentences. He has dark hair, and is mostly a nice guy." - Now convert that list into an EMOTION (just like you did
                  in the story example). That emotion is the psi-sig.</p>

                  <p>I know that a lot of weird things happen for untold reasons and people I talk to might be hiding the fact that they can hear me through ESP, I mean I hear just about anyone I come in contact with, and they respond (either through physical movements or through their thoughts), BUT the fact still
                  remains that I hear people's thoughts, on a different level that you might think. QUESTION am I crazy???? What do you think!</p>

                  <p>You might be crazy. But you might not be <img src="blah.gif"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. Take serious time to examine yourself to see what is so crazy about what you're saying. Think logically. Don't think of just your perspective - think of other people's perspectives too. I doubt people would hide facts from you on purpose. Relax and take it easy.</p>

                  <p>One good way to test whether you're crazy or not is to try and VERIFY what you hear. For example, ask someone to think of a fruit. Then see if you can hear what they're thinking, and guess it correctly. If you think that they'll lie, tell them to write it down before you guess. That way they can't
                  change the answer after you tell them what you think. Some people do lie - but if you can get them to write it down FIRST, then they can't pull any tricks on you.</p>

                  <p>Don't worry so much. A lot of times people accept it - if you explain it in THEIR terms. Of course they won't know what a "psi ball" is, or a "construct" - but they do know what intuition, vibes, gut feelings, dreams, will power, etc... When I talk to people about it, I don't dive head first into
                  everything, usually I start with "Oh, I'm really interested in the paranormal". MOST people actually ARE interested in the paranormal... so you really don't sound that crazy.</p>
