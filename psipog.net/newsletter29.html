PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #29, for April 23, 2006

"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather
wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to
yearn for the vast and endless sea."

- Antoine de Saint Exupery



Dear PsiPog Users,

Lot of excellent responses so far, especially in terms of
the letters recieved. While there is plenty of response to the
newsletter itself, it lacks in responses to the activities. If
everyone is worried about whether their attempts will look
silly to others, and would rather just wait to compare to
other's responses, no responses get sent in. Try and have a
positive attitude about it and then everyone else will follow
in step, and you might just find they had the same, if not a
similiar experience, as you.

=================================================================

This next bit is from a user expressing their suggestions for
letting those around you know about your interest in psi:

Coming out of the closet

Okay first I just want to give my regard to everyone that's
made this newsletter possible, there really isn't anything like
this in much places.

One of the biggest problems most psions have in their life is
deciding whether or not someone should or shouldn't know that
they practice psionics, sure it all seems easy in theory "just
tell them and whatever happens happens", but in real life you
need to remember that once you come clear there's no coming back
(except if someone just thinks your kidding :P). Well anyways,
I've heard many cases of people being depressed because their
parents have negative thought about this ind of stuff, just
keep in mind that most people just think different than most of
us do, its important to accept it, because trying to prove them
otherwise, could be misinterpreted as you being delusional or
have been brainwashed. But don't worry all is not lost, one
thing that always works for me is talking to whoever you want
to come clean with BEFOREHAND about the matter, see what their
thoughts are, its allot easier this way since they're probably
going to give you their actual thoughts about it, but this is
just step one.

Step two can be one of the following:

-Tell them, say your really interested in psionics, giving
them information you've heard and hearing out their opinion,
let them know that you plan on researching more, however don't
tell them you're a Psion because if you tell them too soon after
you introduce the idea into them their really not going to give
you an honest or even fair reaction.

-SHOW THEM, this may come as a surprise for some people but the
vast majority of people that are skeptical need to see to
believe, why? Because knowing that you think isn't enough for
them, just show them something and do as t were a trick, what I
did personally with a friend is that I made certain parts of his
hand cold, then he asked me how I did it, then I said that I
read something about it and that I was practicing, that it want
really a trick, that I hade done it with my mind. His first
reaction was being intrigued, he wanted to know if I could do
anything else, then I did some basic telepathic suggestion. I
sent a number to his head and later on I told him wich one it
was, lucky for me I was able to consecutively send a 1to5,
then 1to10 then 1to20 and 1to50 (1to100 didn't work out).
But what's important here is that he was one of my best friends,
wich is the people you should tell first, and having pushed away
any doubts he had on the matter beforehand, it was a lot easier
for him (or anyone) to accept that someone can be able to do
stuff like that.

This is where most people mess up and then go to the chat
complaining, you gotta make sure someone believes in psionics
before you say you practice it.

Now be assured, YOU SHOULDNT, no matter how confident you are,
let EVERYONE know, it would be a big mistake, reading one of
not_important's articles he didn't seem very happy with the
attention being able to drag chairs comes with. There will
always be people out there looking to bust your chops, asking
you to do this, do that, prove this, explain to them, get mental
help; but its all part of living in the society that we are in,
and quite frankly until there is a major social event in wich
psionics would be involved there wont be massive acceptance
whatsoever.

Concerning parents: Most users here are barely 14 or 15, meaning
that most live with at least one guardian, so I should say
something apart for this case. NEVER try to enforce an idea to
them, they do know more than you even though not when it comes
to this and they DO have authority over you, making them have
weird thoughts about you is the last thing you might want. Try
talking to them, see if something has ever happened to them
concerning psychics and what there ideas are on it. Some people
like me might find that one of there parents are a lot more
positive on the subject, I had no idea my dad once had a near
death experience.

Confront them individually, just remember that there are
different people and they are likely to have different ideas,
its also pretty bonding if its "your little secret" with one of
them, its very good to find support if you ever get overloaded
or if you experience something for the first time and your
scared. But sometimes its better if you just know that they
accept it (you might just want acceptance, they don't really
need to say "I accept you"), you don't need to tell them, just
live your life normally, practice PK or something in the
kitchen, they'll catch on, or maybe they won't. Something I
know is that most people feel uneasy about keeping secrets
from a relative. Just see what their ideas are on the topic
and do what you feel is best. I'm not saying you should
keeps secrets to your guardian(s), this is just for reference.

Now to conclude I hope whoever reads this finds it insightful,
I personally have told the friend I mentioned earlier, another
that was practicing energy manipulation without any reference
and ended up getting overloaded in some big party and his
brother, who told their sister, who told all my class, wich
though she was just kidding, but then I started getting random
people come talk to me personally about
psionics, to a point that I found out that one of my friends
brother studies that kind of stuff since he was 12 (he's
finishing college, don't know his age)… al to the point that
I know at least 7 people in my town that practice psionics, I
just had to be careful, and try not to mess up beyond repair.

=================================================================

Last week's Activity: This exercise is going to involve making
anintelligent construct and try and get it to maintain itself
for more than a few days. Your intelligent construct can be
anythingsuch as animal or small faries...if you must. Program
them withbasic movements and commands, and don't forget about
theirenergy supply so they don't die out. Try this for the next
2 weeks and then send in your results towards the end of the
second week.

=================================================================
Activity #4: This one was given to me by Xict and it goes as
follows :

While attending daily life take a minute to pause and look at
your surroundings. For example : Look out a window and try to
obtain as much detail as you can of the area you see. When
ready, close your eyes and take as much time as you need to
re-create the image in your head. Try to include as much as you
can. With practice you will more easily be able to recall
objects in places you have already visited and thus increasing
your ability to visualize.

=================================================================

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================

Corey asks:
Hi, for some reason I always seem to have deja vu every single
day. All the time I feel like I already did this or that. In
fact now I feel deja vu I dont know whats up with all this but I
would love to go further in time to see my future or other
peoples futures. My mother has all these incredibly weird
dreams and feelings all the time she has pretty much felt death.
Her head hurt so much long ago she felt as if she was going to
pass out, and then around 9:00 she got a phone call explaning
to her that her aunt died from a stroke. also for every bad
dream I have if i get stabbed or something ill wake up and find
my the place were I was stabbed would throb with pain my mom says
its just from sleeping weird,but this happens everytime. What
should I do?

My comments: First off, I've experienced the thing with dejavu
before, in which I would go about my day and a lot of things
would happen in which I thought I had experienced before, but
had in no way actually experienced such, because it would be
at times and places I was positive I hadn't been to before. The
only explanation would be that I dreamed the place or event,
but didn't remember it. I've also assumed, maybe I knew the
event was going to happen on some level, and the "dejavu" was
simply an assurance of things happening according to what I
had in mind. Keep in mind by some level, I mean one that was
not concious to me.

As for the things your mother experienced these things are
common occurances in life. People have experienced them for
years. Not only does this occur in relatives, but it also
occurs in some connections with psychiatrist and their patients.
One simply needs a connection to another, and a certain
sensitivity towards that connection to experience such.

The last part about sleeping wrong could very well be that you
are sleeping wrong, or simply the fact that your body
simply replicates the experience in your sleep, which is common
in such cases as people who sleepwalk.

IanuSempai concerns:
I have seen reports of people that create psiballs that
actually visibly appear, but during all of my attempts, this
has never happened. I'm entirel ysure that the psiballs are
actually there, seeing as I can feel them, and I can feel my
energy flowing into them, but I could never see them. What's
weird is that my one friend who has no training whatsoever in
psionics said he saw it even when I didn't tell him I was making
one. What's going on?

In the guides on the site, it says to use an energy source for
your Pyrokenesis. However, instead of designating a target, I
just use my own energy. This, as it should, leaves me very cold,
but sometimes, the object I'm trying to heat up becomes cold.
It has only happened a few times, but It's enough to freak
me out. Am I accidentally using Cryokenesis? It seems unlikely,
but I'm told by my brother that it's possible.

My comments: Your friend could possibly be more sensitive to
energy at this point in time. thought seeing is not everything,
such as if things are dark, and you can't see well, you are
going to try and feel your way through the dark, rather than
relying on sight. So why should you rely on it at all time?

As for the Pyrokinesis part, the whole concept is to speed up
the particles of an object enough to increase the heat content
inside of it. To cool down an object would be just the opposite.
To slow down the particles, to where they don't produce so much
heat. From this, the explanation of accidently doing one, while
attempting the other cannot be done, unless I know more about
the method you are using. For assumption's sake, I take from
what you said, that you are trying to take energy from yourself
and put it into an object to heat it up, rather than just
having the object heat itself up. Using your energy to act as
a catalyst for the object, since it needs energy to move faster,
would seem more effective than having your energy do all the
work. With all this said there is one more possibility that
with all the energy of yours you are putting into an object,
when you become cold, your energy may mock that and cause the
object to become such.

Dayvid asks:
I think I made a psiball on my third try but it looked like a
spherical shadow and it felt like static electricity in my palm.
I wanted to find out if I made one because I have never read
anything like this. Also how many times do you have to use a
skill with an anchor to achieve successful anchoring?

My comments: I onced showed my sister a demonstration of a
construct and she explained how it felt cold and staticy, so it
sounds like you are doing a good job on that part. As for
anchoring, it could be different for each person, but the
article was just a general outline to go by, not a definite
representation of it. Just keep up the good work, and if
something doesn't first work out the way you expect, don't
give up.

Ninja Wolfness wonders:
Me and my friend did telpathy across the internet, and he lives
in the United States and I live in Canada. and it sorta worked.
He was trying to send me a feeling from a video game, and i got
what he was sidetracked with : going to the beach, so it wasn't
totally successful. And I can make my hands go sorta warm and
cold, but it usually doesnt work. I've tried psi-wheel, and I
can't really do a psiball. So I'm curious, are some people just
not able to do some stuff, or is there an something easier I
could do to start off TK, other than a psiwheel, cause thats not
working for me so far. Am I totally not figuring out something
from all the excercizes I've read on the net? I am really
interested in doing psi-stuff..but havent had much success.
Any tips?

My comments: As for the being able to do some things and not
others, there can be the possiblity that you are better at first
in certain categories than others. This doesn't mean you can't
do the others without practice, it just means that you are going
to have to work harder in some categories than others. As for
suggestions, you sound like you are really interested, and due
to this you may be putting too much stress on recieving results
that you are simply trying too hard. Take it slow, and don't
rush things, because putting too much stress on getting results
only makes a bad outcome seem worse than it really is.

=================================================================

Telepsycho brings up:

Ok. I have a few things.

First off:
question about my dreams. Sometimes when my eyes are a bit tired
and I go to sleep, I have this weird dream. It has happened to
me a few times. Ok, here it is: I fall asleep, and after some
time, some beats come to me, like something coming at me, but
not hurting me and making a beat. There are big beats, which
sometimes look like gray, round rocks. The smaller ones are
round too, but are a pale yellow or middle-pail green, like a
point of light. The big ones feel like they are blocking my
path, and the smaller ones are just there and are as if they
let me pass through them. They come in regular intervals and
sometimes, two big beats come at the same time with a small
one in between. I call them beats because they come at me but
stop when they reach me. Like heartbeats. Your opinions on what
this is? BTW, I don't think it is a frustration dream.

Second thing:
I read the previous newsletter and noticed that the same
experience Rickti had, had been experienced by other people
on psipog or in previous newsletters. I think the solution
was that the sitting on the ground made them lose energy
through the ground.

Third thing: (Removed, read below)

Fourth thing:
I don't really believe time travel is possible, because time is
an idea, not a fact. In the world, there are no records of lets
say 56 AD or 386 BC. The world does not have time. It is just a
thought that lets us organize our life. To go back in time means
to make the earth spin backwards along with all the other
planets, and that is impossible. But since everything is
possible, well, I am not really confident that time travel is
possible. I mean, time is not a factor like gravity or
electricity that can be made change in nature.

My Comments:
First part...I had similiar experience one time at the beginning
of an OBE. I was laying there, and then starting getting the
feelings of waves going over my body, then I heard what sounded
like heartbeats but longer and more exaggerated, after 3 of them
another wierd wave came over me, and I moved out of my body. On
my return, I heard my neighboors leaf blower running, and got
up to see what the loud noise was, but after I got up, I noticed
the sound was not as loud as I first thought it was. So from
this I concluded that possibly the beats I heard were just
amplification of the sound of my heartbeat.

Second thing...I cannot say too much on the matter myself, as
I don't make grounding a regular practice of my own. But I would
assume be closer to the object you are trying to send your
energy into would increase your prociency in doing so.

Third thing...
I removed this part because while you seem to have the basic
idea of Teleportation, no one knows for sure how such would work,
and we really don't need to worry about members trying to work
on things as experimental as such. But just for knowledges sake,
mainly because I recieved other responses to Teleportation, the
theory stands that Teleportation would not be anything in the
sense of phasing through air, because simply put, open air is
not the end all connection from one thing to another. After all
"empty" air is still full of matter and particles, just as
everything else is.

Fourth thing...Time is a state of matter at intervals, if things
never changed, time would not exist as there would be no measure
to relate it to. So to refer to going back in time is simply
implying you can return something to the state it was before at
any given interval in the "past". This is where various theories
factor in, and I'm not going to say one theory is better than
the other.
