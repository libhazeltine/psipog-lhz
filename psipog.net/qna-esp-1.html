                  <p>Hi you seem to only concentrate on using psi in telepathy. However, from my experience and with what I've read from the forum(see telepathy forum, 2nd page, "How good is your telepathy", posted by NeoPsychic) that there is a way to use telepathy even without psi. Can you produce articles on this
                  and how to utilize it like a manual specifically for beginners? thanks.</p>

                  <p>No, by definition, if you are using telepathy, you are therefore using psi.</p>

                  <p>"Psi" is a variable used to designate the unknown mechanism or mechanisms that allows telepathy and psychokinesis to function. The mechanism or mechanisms which allow telepathy to function may or may not be the same as the ones which allow psychokinesis to work.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello Psipog mods<br />
                  I decided to put my questions under perception because they envolve emotions and talking to your subconscious.</p>

                  <p>1) When learning to communicate with your subconscious, will learning self-hypnosis help, and if so, can you please tell me whether this is a good place to learn it.<br />
                  <a href="http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/learn_hypnosis.html"
                     target="_blank">http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/learn_hypnosis.html</a><br />
                  If that place sucks can you please tell me a way to get good at speaking with your subconscious.</p>

                  <p>2) Concerning trancing, can someone please tell me a good way to go into a trance for communicating with your subconscious, because i found (meaning no disrespect) that the trancing guide was not very detailed, and it evolved listening to music, but i would like to know if there is a certain type
                  of good visualization, like the decending stairway and colors.</p>

                  <p>3) For clearing my mind, I find thinking about a place that you really wish to be in, or dosen;t even exist but seems perfect to you. It depends what kind of person you are. I find that when i think about kind of medieval settings like being in a forest or a plain with hills that go far into the
                  horizon, and a stream that you can drink from (i.e not polluted) and wildlife everywhere (herbivorous :p) and just pretty much a nature setting like that (think lord of the rings middle earth) I know this sounds really geeky and weird, but when i do think about it it effectively clears my mind and
                  causes an extremely peaceful emotion. I was wondering if anyone else has ever kind of felt like that, i realise that it varies between people, like someone might be more attracted to big cities or beaches, as opposed to nature.</p>

                  <p>Sorry for the length of this. If anyone has the time to answer i would appreciate it. I just want to communicate with my subconscious (desperately).</p>

                  <p>Thanks if you answer, if not it dosen't matter, i realise you guys are busy so it dosen;t really matter.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>1 - Sorry, communication with sub-c came before I ever entered a trance (intentionally), so I cannot objectively evaluate that. I can tell you that when I meditate in a busy setting (ie. free time in on a couch somewhere), I have often used "Deep and Slow" from
                  https://dragonrising.com/downloads/</p>

                  <p>2 - The music is kinda my style of getting into a trance, but it is not uncommon for me to "picture your eyes 10 inches into your head" or a descent through the colors (count quickly, going through Red, Orange, Yellow, ect.) Although the last is more of a meditation, it should be enough to
                  establish a stable sub-conscious link.</p>

                  <p>3 - Hey man, do watever works for you. The idea of people using calm surroundings to help aid them in their peaceful meditation is not a foreign concept, and undoubtedly helps a good many people.</p>

                  <p>well ok im kind of confused what is happening in my life now,(no this is not a teen help story or life story) i used to be obsessed with this kind of stuff, and now im well...not but strange things have been happening. about 6 months agao i would say the EXACT same thing at the EXACT same time as
                  my dad, but the it stopped for a while. then i met my best friend (who i dont want to say real name so for now her name is kia) who we were good friends and ( the only one i remember before it was obvious) i vaguely remember me crying to kia how i didnt have feelings for my boyfriend anymore and i
                  didnt want to break up with him because i still wanted to be best friends with him and as i was leaving the building me and kia said the same thing at the same time just coincidence right? well it started happening more and more then when she spent the night i would either say the exact same thing at
                  the same time or be thinking the same exact thing. and i always tell myself "oh i must just be guessing and its all just a trick" but now im having second thoughts about these little "coincidences"<br />
                  and ever since before i can remember id be thinking about say... a certain episode of a tv show and an hour later there it was! (this was before you could check on your tv what was on) or a certain song and then 2 songs later [on a radio] it would play.</p>

                  <p>and lately ive been getting i dont know "signs(?)" would you call them? for things.because i would get the silliest little "sign" (it vaires,from me dropping something and seeing something related to what happened later on to my phone dropping on a keyboard typing out kin h which me and kia both
                  thought of kingdom hearts and that i should get it) and sooner or later something that was related to the sign would happen. (i dont like these signs very much they are kind of creepy)</p>

                  <p>now what im really asking is this all just one big coincidence? or is it a connection/telepathy/seeing into future or just my crazy imagination?</p>

                  <p>if it is telepathy should i try and improve this "gift"? or just leave it be?<br />
                  becuase telepathy is the one power ive never really wanted (of course life isnt really pick and choose now is it?)</p>

                  <p>I do not know how many of these occurences there are, but from the way that you tell your tale, there seems to be a good many of them. If you are having a number of incidents of percognition/telepathy in a short period of time, I would say that they are genuine and that the next step is control.
                  To prove to yourself that you can do this, attempt the active, rather than passive. Try to will an occurence of telepathy to happen. This should prove it to yourself.</p>

                  <p>Hi<br />
                  I was wondering, do you think that improving your TK abilities would improve your sending abilities in telepathy? I was speculating that it might, because to move objects with TK, you have to know how to forcibly (somewhat?) direct your psi toward the object, and that's the same with telepathy,
                  right? Only towards people instead of objects :)<br />
                  Just curious.. and also looking for other "creative" ways to improve my sending ability, because I find it much more difficult than receiving.<br />
                  Thanks in advance!</p>

                  <p>Most of the time, certain abilities are linked together and improve together as a group. Generally, these are clumped into two categories of "perceptive" and "affective" abilities. Telekinesis yould be related to other affective abilities such as energy manipulation, and telepathic sending. More
                  passive things like telepathic receiving and remote presence are closely related.</p>

                  <p>Hello,</p>

                  <p>I just had a quick question regarding something I read in the Telepathy Manual here is the section:</p>

                  <p>2) Target Related Items</p>

                  <p>Another method of tracking a target is by the use of items related to the target. The first step to this is, obviously, acquire an object that is in some way or another related to the target. Then, using your non-dominant hand (do NOT use your dominant hand), run your fingers or your hand's energy
                  field over the field of the object. Target the feeling of the pattern you get from the object.<br />
                  B. Backtrailing an incoming signal</p>

                  <p>I am wondering why you have to use your non-dominant hand, what is the difference between the two?</p>

                  <p>Good question. For some reason, the dominant hand tended to be less sensitive, and also to imprint the item with more data, in studies (and long-term usage of psychometry) by Bevy Jaegers and her students. Her results were replicated by other researchers. It is thought to be related to mental
                  "balances", but the actual cause is unknown at this time.</p>

                  <p>Short version: it works better with the non-dominant hand.</p>

                  <p>If not, there's a good chance that your blood sugar is dropping rapidly. (It is _possible_, but much less common for the blood sugar to spike, in the same circumstances, so don't count on this stuff to regulate your blood sugar levels.)</p>

                  <p>Hi, sorry for taking your time, but I would be really greatful if you could answer my question.</p>

                  <p>In the past year I've developped this strange "feeling" (for lack of a better word). I'll attempt to describe it; I get a different "feeling" for every person I know, or I meet. I can feel what kind of personality a person has once I meet them. Sometimes I even get impressions of colours
                  associated to them. For example, when I'm around my best friend, I sense the colour green and sometimes pink, and I also feel an influence of happiness and serenity. When I'm around someone I don't like, I feel uneasy because of the feeling I get from them being around me. Once they leave, that
                  feeling goes with them. It's almost as if I interpret a person's qualities with a specific, unique "character". I sometimes get this with certain places. Like at a friend's house, I sense that the room I'm in is somewhat ..nagative, or is 'sending' me negative energy. At times I can get used to that
                  specific feeling or trait of that person or place. Also, sometimes it's harder for me to get a specific feeling for some people/places than others. I don't think I'm making a lot of sense right now, but this is the best i could come up with. I read an article on psi signature scanning, and that is
                  the closet explanation I got, but I'm just not convinced yet. I also noticed that once when I was under the influence of alcohol, these feelings became a lot stronger and more distinct for people. It was as if I could close my eyes and tell who was who just by 'feeling' their unique presence. So my
                  question is, do you think this has anything to do with psi? Or is it just what everyone feels at some point or another? What do you think?</p>

                  <p>Sorry for wasting your time in case this has nothing to do with psi, but I just want to make sure. Thanks for your time.</p>

                  <p>The question is: are you doing this based on things that you observe about a person, or is it happening with people that you first meet? If it is happening even before the person starts to talk (or gives clues about personality) then you are probably doing some elementary form of scanning on the
                  person in question. there are, of course, other explanations for this (interpretting ther stride, facial expressions, ect). Associating the feeling of a person with a color is not uncommon, and typically people move to some form or aura interpretation from this (whether they exist or not is still up
                  in the air... but this may be just a visual interpretation of a scan).</p>

                  <p>I think that what you have described probably has something to do with psi and is fairly normal for a scanning procedure.</p>
