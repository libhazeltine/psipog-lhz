                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  My main interest in this site is actually telekinesis, which I haven't been able to manage yet but that's not what this question is about<br />
                  I've (accidentally at first) been able to achieve small pyro and cyro PK effects but haven't been able to control which one I get. Is it just a matter of more consistent practice or am I probably overlooking something. I've read Rainsong's article but somehow the temperature change I create is still
                  in a random direction.<br />
                  That being said, I generally am able to achieve the desired effect by stopping and trying again until I get it right.</p>

                  <p>This is kind of for all of the Kinesis but manly Pyro, Ive been able to get really into it mentally and every thing with visualizations but once I sit there and try it I cant get my mind to calm down and relax and let me take over.I just get really hot, my breathing quickens, and I get very tired
                  am I doing it right and if so is that normal?</p>

                  <p>It's fairly common when trying something that either<br />
                  a) you simply don't have the oomph for, or<br />
                  b) you've got enough oomph but you're not focussing it.</p>

                  <p>It seems to be most common in attempts at psychokinetic effects, but has been reported in some telepathy attempts.</p>

                  <p>The problem is that this can mean result in pushing your body beyond its limits, trying something just that _little bit_ beyond what you can manage. Pushing yourself beyond your limits _can_ cause injury, up to and including your death.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Got a bit of a puzzler for you,</p>

                  <p>I have been able to perform TK in what I feel to be a weird way<br />
                  When I started doing psi I decide that some meditation would be a good start.<br />
                  I could feel a kind of magnetic pulsing that pushed my hands together and apart.</p>

                  <p>I decide that I would try to transfer the magnetic feeling into my psi wheel and use that to move it. At first it had little effect but then it moved a little, after a few more days it was spinning quite fast and I felt ready for the next stage I tried to move a pencil but have not yet managed
                  it.</p>

                  <p>Is this a known method? And if so how can I improve on it?</p>

                  <p>Any help you can offer would be good<br />
                  Thanks for reading this</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Yes, this is a known method. The 'magnetic pulsing' that you feel is a substance we call 'psi'. (For more information look under the 'psi-ball' section of the site). Pushing this substance onto the psi-wheel has the effect that the psi-wheel will begin to move. To move a pen or pencil is the same
                  as the psi-wheel, just with more force. Practice more, and you will have it.</p>

                  <p>in a question i read before it was said distance negatively effects telekinesis(the farther away you are the easier) yet to me it seems that the farther away i am(as long as i can see the object clearly) the easier it is, has anyone else been like this?, and does anyone know why this is?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The short answer to this is that "it's all in your head". Distances in psionics tend to matter very little. If long-distance TK works for you, great! However, for most people, distance presents a mental barrier to TK being effective.</p>

                  <p>Personally, I find that distance makes a difference, but whether it is "all in my head" or not, I cannot say with any certainty. On the other hand, it's not limited to line-of-sight, either....</p>

                  <p>I have a hard time spinning psiwheels without a direct line of sight of them. Even when I have my psiwheel on the desk, and focus on the live feed displayed my computer screen, it's much harder. I've tried spinning other peoples' psiwheels through a webcam with no luck. I've heard of others having
                  luck doing it over a webcam though, so it seems possible.</p>

                  <p>Hello guys. =) I just wanted to say I love the site! A few days ago I was bopping around, and I came across a link to fork-it.com; and I liked that site as well. I came back, intrested even more in pk and i came across some questions people had asked...about people dying from doing it?</p>

                  <p>Now, i should tell you right now that I have OCD which means i obsess about things, mainly my health...and it's probably completely stupid, but i can't help it..anyway how can people die from using it? I can't refind the letter i had read, but it was something about your heart?</p>

                  <p>Could you please elaborate? And perhaps tell me how to prevent this? or something of the sorts? The thing is I love psionics, psi, i love learning about things, and this whole thing fascinates me. I just can't help worrying.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I've had extensive personal experience with precognition, remote viewing, out of body experiences and things like that, but I've never experienced anything that affected matter in a direct way, such as levitation of psychokinesis. Is there anyone how can do it that would be willing to demonstrate
                  it to me? My intellect says it must be real because I deeply understand that life is made of the same substance that dreams are made of. On the other hand, because I've never experienced it, it seems impossibly difficult. I understand that my beliefs are affecting the outcome, which is why I?m
                  seeking to find someone who will demonstrate it for me. What I'm looking for is a 4 minute mile kinda event in my life where seeing it so greatly affects my mind that life changes for me.</p>

                  <p>I've spent many hours over the years, but never have had success. Anyone here able to demonstrate or know of anyone who can and will?</p>

It _is_ possible, and numerous people through this very site, reading the same articles you are reading have used it. The biggest key is to practice. I know that this probably

                  <p>Hi,<br />
                  I'm a person who cannot really visualize that well. I'm an awesome daydreamer and can fall into imaginations randomly but it's when someone tells me to visualize, I just can't!<br />
                  I can create psi balls, well, at least I'm convinced that I can. But when I try to programme and throw it, I have trouble.<br />
                  So, when you've thrown the psi ball, how do you know where It has landed? How do you know it hasn't just fallen apart and disappeared?</p>

                  <p>In response, I suggest that you read the Sensitivty Manual ( <a href="art-sensitivity-manual.html"
                     target="_blank">art-sensitivity-manual.html</a> ), it has a number of activities that you can 
practice in order to make yourself more sensitive to psionic energy.</p>
