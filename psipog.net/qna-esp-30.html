                  <p>Emotions are being sent by everyone around you... People naturally project their emotions. That's why empaths have to shield against the onslaught of emotions flying around. It is possible to strengthen your ability to project your emotions, and the skill is called empathetic projection (not too

                  <p>Probably not. At any rate, there has been no evidence of which I am aware which would indicate such a limitation. That said, hiding from your own emotions becomes increasingly difficult, the more you get into some of the perceptive psionic/psychical skills.</p>

                  <p>Dear Psipog,</p>

                  <p>I am a true empath I have had the gift since birth, it's a family tradition that the women or next in line are to have a power and I was fortunate to get this one. Here is my question. Is it ok that after touching a lot of people that I get confused on who I am, it's like i get mixed up on which
                  thoughts are mine. So I was wondering if I need to just practice more or it is normal.</p>

                  <p>Note - I DO have tremendous control of my mental state, my specialty is repressing unwanted emotions inside myself (although it does make me a rather cold and emotionless person).</p>

                  <p>Control of one's own emotions is another issue entirely. It is generally healthier to control rather than repress them, though.</p>

                  <p>That said, it is entirely possible that you have no need of Shields to protect yourself from telepathic overloading of any kind, empathic or otherwise. Of course, that is more likely a question of your Sensitivity, than anything to do with your repressed emotions......</p>

                  <p>1 - When I first started, silence helped me focus but now I've gotten pretty good at RP, and can do it in noisy areas like classrooms or with loud music playing.</p>

                  <p>2 - Yes I can move, and I believe theres a paragraph in the article dedicated to that</p>

                  <p>3 - When RPing I am capable of thinking, I don't recall if I've ever had a song stuck in my head though. In that case it may be a little harder to concentrate and have succesful results.</p>

                  <p>4 - I had success on my first try, however thats not going to be the same for everyone right? If you don't get good results the first time, keep trying until you do.</p>

                  <p>Ok, I've got a weird thing going on whenever I try to alter my consciousness.<br />
                  Here recently I've been experimenting with altered states of consciousness. I mostly try it before I go to sleep so that I can relax easier. The weird thing is that two nights after doing this I started jerking back to full consciousness and feeling as though I've heard a voice. I kept doing the
                  techniques, and soon I was able to hear the voices, keep in the altered state, and understand what was said. I don't know what's going on, but I have a feeling that I'm picking up on my family's dreams and thought, or that I myself am reaching the dreaming/awake stage and staying there longer. Does
