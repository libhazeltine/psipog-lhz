PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #28, for April 7, 2006

"Losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth."
- Ludwig Borne


Dear PsiPog Users,

Progress is still rolling in the new design of Psipog, and
according to peebrain, everyone will be able to contribute their
knowledge. This means whether you have already started, or
simply have something in mind to share, write it out and have
it ready to start the design off with bang!

Also, I recieved comments concerning the issue of phasing.
For the most part everyone agress on one point : Phasing could
be dangerous/painful. So if you care to try anything in the way
of phasing, you have been warned, IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

=================================================================

I recieved this suggestion from Micah:
Hey, after reading your small introduction to RV I've come with
an idea - why don't you write more about telling the difference
between your simple, obvious thoughts and the real information
you come up with? Describing a few real life examples would be,
in my humble opinion, very useful, wouldn't it? :)

So here goes...
First off, this is the hardest part when it comes to any skill
relating to such thing as thoughts or recieving information from
outside sources and interpreting it into your own perception.
The best way to figure out the difference, is to know your own
perception of things as well as you can. Take for instance, if
you grow flowers for a living(or hobby), and you recieve the
color green. Most likely green is what you most associate with
flowers, or plants, therefore causing your mind to think
"Ohhh it might be a flower!". When this happens your mind
switches to the mindset of flowers, and starts trying to
create the rest of this image of this "flower". It pulls from
your knowledge of flowers, and starts trying to plug bits of
information in to make what you are recieving make sense. So
now you have all this information, and you are almost positive
it is a flower or maybe its even become a meadow of flowers by
now. And then the fateful moments comes....and it is a green
crayon. You are totally blown away with where all the rest came
from and feel dissapointed you weren't correct.

Where did it all go wrong? I would say it went wrong when you
tried to make a mountain out of a molehill. Don't try and make
something more than what it is, or try and build off of a
simple piece of information, this is where the imagination,
and our own ideas of things get in the way. No matter what kind
of information, or in what form you recieve, take note of it,
and move on. If you spend too much time on one piece of
information, your mind is going to start trying to link it
with things it knows. This is where it is up to you to decide
whatever information you recieved, be it sights, sounds,
smells, or just strictly information itself, or... just simply
your imagination.

It could also help if you practice communication with your
subconscious. You can find it here :
art-fire-and-ice.html6
This can possibly help achieve a clearer communication for
better recieval of information. Which may in the end help
prevent confusion on what are your own thoughts, and those
from another source. In the end it all comes down to be
different for each person. While one may recieve informtation
in the form of images, another may recieve it as sound, and so
on, and then there is most common reported strictly just
information. To say one is more accurate than another is all
about personal preference, and I suggests doing what ever
works best for you.

As for examples from my own experience of times when I
incorrectly guessed or during my practices :

A)I once decided something was a duck simply from the color
yellow, and the feeling of the feather like texture...turned
out to be a dandelion.

B)Another time I got a barn, and then when I got the color
brown I automatically assumed their was a tree around.

C)I once had a target of sponge bob for someone, and they came
up with the color orange with the rest of the information,
which was lacking from mine. When they found out what the
target was, they informed me their friend had a spongebob
within view which had an orange hat.

I hope these help you get the idea of how things within your
daily life can affect the way your mind treats RV.

Activity #2 Results: My object from last newsletter was my
camera, and since I can't take a picture of it :P, here is a
link to what one looks like http://tinyurl.com/mors7. The
interesting part is that I left a few pictures on it just for
the heck of it, and it seems they may have played more of a role
than I would of thought.

I recieved some comments on what it was, and here are a few of
them.

The following is from Scott:
Here's my thought on Oneta's Object:
-Snapping-ish ... like something that connects things together
-Different points ... spiky like an animal or hair brush
-cushioned
-bright colors.
-long background stable solid color dark.

This was a bit odd as it almost perfectly describes the very
first picture that was on my camera. The picture can be found
here : http://tinyurl.com/guhmn . I found this to be very
exciting results as it shows the connections made in simply
assigning the object as the camera.

Caleb commented on seeing "a black-ish circle object a ball
or cd maybe. I dont know possibly with some other dark colors
on it"

Could this be the gears in the other pic? Or the lens of the
camera? To me this example shows how variant the information
recieved during RV is. Some get the whole picture, than some,
maybe due to it being their first time, or the variant nature of
RV get less of the full picture than others.

=================================================================

Activity #3: This exercise is going to involve making an
intelligent construct and try and get it to maintain itself for
more than a few days. Your intelligent construct can be anything
such as animal or small faries...if you must. Program them with
basic movements and commands, and don't forget about their
energy supply so they don't die out. Try this for the next 2
weeks and then send in your results towards the end of the
second week. Good luck all!

=================================================================

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================

True Psion concerns:
A few months ago, I tried OBEing. I tried doing this for a month
or so before getting discouraged. Because of this, I now have
trouble doing Psionics again. I can't move the wheel like I used
to and something as simple as psi-manipulation has become a
hassle to perform. I think it may be the trouble I had with the
OBEs. I ask, how would you go about regaining confidence if you
were in this situation? Also, do you know of any easy ways to
OBE besides the classic ROPE technique, waking up early, and
the similar techniques.

My comments: First off, I have never had never had an OBE while
I was actually attempting to. Normally when I attempt I end up
falling asleep, and having a less exciting time, than when I go
to sleep normally. Any time I've ever experienced an OBE was
when I was not really attempting to. I find it is easier to
achieve an OBE when you remain passive about it, rather than
stressing it. When you put so much stress on something and then
it doesn't come through it is natural for you to feel more let
down than if you approach it passively. As for the decline in
other, it could very well be you lack enthusiam to get things
done, so you don't put enough effort into. Basically you should
approach things with enough of an emphasis to achieve it, but
not so much that if things don't go according to plan you get
discouraged.

=================================================================

Chris wonders:
I can be doing anything and concentrate a little and I will feel
a sensation where I concentrate on. Say I concentrate on my
hands I start feeling a sensation sometimes feeling like
pressure or an odd sense of pain( one that doesn't hurt all that
much). I can move this senstation around and sometimes I feel as
though something is running down my arms but then the sensation
changes in my hands to something that doesn't hurt. My question
is what exactly is it that I am feeling? Is it the way psi is
suppose to "feel" or is it something like biofeekback?

My comments: This would seem to fall more under the factors of
awareness, or as some call it sensitivity. You can try some of
the exercises listed here art-psiball-source.html7
such as imagine your awareness traveling into another room, and
then record your feelings, or expanding it out upon your general
surroundings and see how it feels. All in all it sounds like you
are making good progress so far, you just need some ideas to get
you going in further advancing your clarity of it.

=================================================================

Rickti asks:
Hi when I'm making a Psiball I get light headed, but its not
when I'm getting energy. Its when I'm making the ball and I'm
sitting on the ground outside.

My comments: You could simply be overexerting yourself energy
wise, and may be feeling this in the form of fatigue. Even
though you are drawing energy, maybe you are putting out more
than you are taking in and in the end, you are just gettting
dizzy.

=================================================================

Sircubes delivers:
First off, let me start off with an introduction of myself. I am
15 and I am a gamer. I have wanted to do things in what would
involve controlling my energy and things like that forever. I
just never believe it was possible. I would always daydream in
school, usually about a fantasy world, I suppose you could refer
to things like Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. One day,
some friends decided to introduce me into the world of Magick,
like witchcraft used in the Pagan/Wiccan religion. I myself do
not belong to any religion, but as we did things together,
relating, I would sense energy and things like
that. My mind grows more open each day and I can feel my own
potential rising. As i got more into the stuff, even though i
knew little of it, I would develop my own beliefs, I guess you
would say, on it. Magick seemed just another term for chi, psi,
energy, ki, and all those other synonyms. One day, while
searching through a forum, about a specific game, I found a
topic related to the paranormal. That led me to PsiPog. And I
learned how to make my first psiball and soon after a shield :).
Before long I was able to see it with my own eyes and my sense
became greater. I even got a friend to experiment
with me. I taught him how to make a psiball, and we both could
see each others. It was all fun, but before long, we started
to not pay much attention to it and I began to forget about
psipog. After a while I began experimenting with my thoughts
on how to use telekinesis, phase, teleport, and things relating
to psionics as a whole. I haven't been successful yet :). I
have had my experiences with lucid dreaming and de ja vu rather
frequently. There was like a two month period where i had
nothing but lucid dreams, but they are hard to come by now.
I recently wanted to find PsiPog again, but I had forgotten
the name itself. I figured it would pop up somewhere and I
managed to find it on April 1st where a forum I go to had a
thread about the jokes being played on that day. It had a
link to the Wikipedia section and it was the first one listed,
about the whale homepage, which I found amusing :). Oddly
enough, when I went to the Wikipedia entry later that day,
this site was not listed.

Currently I have mainly been reproducing shields when i feel
needed, Im not entirely sure on how stable they are, but I like
to make them anyway. I also play around with my energy, like
swirl some of it around me and move it back and forth. I read
the last three articles of the newsletter so far, and have found
it to be pretty interesting. I tried the thing where you move
your fingers in a circular motion to make a psiball, and it was
the clearest psiball I have seen myself make. I suppose I
should move on to some questions now, Im not sure if they are
in the Q & A section, but I dont have that much time to
look right now.

Those dreams where it seems you are completely paralyzed and
something is going to attack you, what do those usually mean?
I have had a total of 3 where I had woken up in my bed and i
was paralyzed and there was something above me. The first time
I had no choice but to watch, I only managed to throw my covers
off. The second time I managed to break three of the paralyzed
state and reach for the thing above me, it merely floated, or
ran, away, then I woke up. The third time I made myself wake up
before anything happened. Next time this happens I want to go
through with it a little more, is this a good idea? What info
is known about those types of dreams?

I have also had dreams where they feel real (most of my dreams
feel real, they have gotten to the point where I cant tell a
difference at all) and I have been pulled by an invisible force
towards somewhere. In another, I was in that paralyzed state on
my steps to my basement under my covers (when my bedroom was in
the basement)

What is known about teleportation? I plan to be
able to do it, at least once, in my life, it may be a little
unrealistic at the time being for me, but I also don't plan
on being able to do it until i learn more ;).. What I imagine
though is that it will be really painful and extremely hard to do.

One of my main and obvious problems is doubt, like when I try
to do telekinesis. Do you know of any way to help get around
that?

I havent read very many articles on this site, but what I have
read has helped a lot, thank you very much for having this as
an open resource. Sorry for the long... message, I just
wanted to get some info across before I got into the questions
that I have :).

My comments: First off, Congratualations on your success so far.
To move on to the first question. What you described is similiar
to what is commonly known as Sleep Paralysis. It is hard to
explain a general concept of what it is besides the inability to
move when you are seemingly awake. What everyone sees while
experiencing Sleep Paralysis, varies as much as dreams do.
Mainly it has been describe in this manner...On your way to
sleep your mind shuts off your whole body, except for your eyes.
Upon a certain moment during the night, your mind wakes up
enough for you to open your eyes, but your body remains asleep,
therefore you can't move. The reason you "hallucinate" things
is because your mind is still halfway asleep, but also
processing what you are seeing, and therefore you see things
you shouldn't. If you still have questions, just search the net
for "Sleep Paralysis". And from my experience of Sleep Paralysis
it was completely safe to sit through it, provided you assure
yourself what is going on is just created by yourself after
all.

For your dreams that seem extremely real, we all go through
this once in a while. As for your explanation of being pulled
somewhere, the closest explanation I can offer is from my
own experience of one time during Sleep Paralysis. Upon
realizing I couldn't move, my vision kinda split in two even
though it was of the same thing, it was literally like I was
seeing two different images of the same thing, rather than
the way our brain converges what we see into one. There was
a strange feeling of being pulled towards a point in my room
but no movement ever resulted from it. Then it quickly faded,
and I drifted out and back into a frozen state, where upon
I saw the door to my kitchen and felt this feeling, except this
time it was pulling me at the door, to where I couldn't really
pull off the door once I was basically smushed up against it.
What was this? I am not sure, but I know it started as Sleep
Paralysis. My suggestion is get used to it happening, and try
and take advantage of it, such as attempt an OBE while your
body is unable to move. Which method you use is up to you, but
there are a few out there to try.

As for Teleportation, I can only direct you to the following
source : http://tinyurl.com/jtple

Now for subject of doubt....First off, I have been doing this
for a while now, and I still have doubts. Doubt is an essential
quality of life. Without doubt, we'd definately be doing some
crazy things throughout our life, and more than likely most of
them are things you would doubt you would ever do now. Doubt is
simply being unsure of something. You can do all kinds of stuff
and then look back, but are you really sure you did them? Doubt
is a very flexible thing, and it is simply an uncertainty you
have pertaining to a certain issue. If I asked you "How many
coins are in this jar?", you would give me an answer, but you
would still be uncertain if it was right. Does that stop you
from pouring open the jar and counting them to prove to see what
the number really is? Well...It shouldn't...but who knows, maybe
it does someone, but it doesn't stop most if they really care.
So why should doubt stop you from carrying out your practices
to produce the results, such as you would open the jar and
count the pennies? Also, doubt is a mind set, it is not
absolute. When you start doubting yourself you create the
feeling of uneasiness in what you are doing, and then this
leads to worse thoughts like "Oh this is never going to work"
and "I have been sitting here forever trying and nothing".
All the while these thoughts are flooding your head, and you
are focusing on them, you could be focused on practicing TK,
and that is where the mind set of doubt gets you most. So
remember : Just because you have doubt about something, doesn't
stop you from carrying out the necessary actions to produce
accurate results.
