         <h2><a name="p00"
            id="p00"></a>Section 1:</h2>

         <h3><a name="p01"
            id="p01"></a>a. Introduction:</h3>Remote Viewing is the ability to gain information which lies beyond the range of our ordinary sense and beyond the conventional constraints of time and space. Currently there are no concrete facts explaining how and why Remote Viewing exists and works the way it does. We
            only have theories which are supported by evidence. The information gathered only helps to motivate us into developing and experimenting with the remote viewing methods. This manual will not describe every detail as to how Remote Viewing works, as it is not necessary to know when performing. Perhaps the
            best way to understand and learn remote viewing, is to practice and decide for yourself, what works and what doesn't work.

         <h3><a name="p02"
            id="p02"></a>b. Warning/disclaimer:</h3>This manual is to be taken seriously. The material below is fully functional, people who are suffering from mental diseases, or severe physical disabilities are not encouraged to practice remote viewing. Sometimes practice can become very strenuous and physical
            ailments may result. If at any time you begin to feel uncomfortable you are encouraged to stop practicing and take a break until you recover.

         <h3><a name="p03"
            id="p03"></a>c. Preparation methods:</h3>To prepare for remote viewing one must calm themselves and "clear their minds" so to speak. This is a very important step when performing remote viewing. It is inconvenient when present thoughts become confused with the information that is being obtained. There are
            many different ways to relax your body and to clear your mind. Any method is good as long as it does those two things.

         <p><b><a name="p04"
            id="p04"></a>i. Relaxation Technique</b></p>

         <p>One technique that can be used is as follows:</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Close your eyes and count backwards from 10 to 0. Focus on slowing down your heart rate and breathing rate.</li>

            <li>Starting with the toes and working your way up, tense and relax all the muscles in your body.</li>

            <li>While relaxing your muscles, try focusing only on breathing. This will help to clear your mind and enhance the results.</li>

            <li>Perform.</li>
         </ol><b><a name="p05"
            id="p05"></a>ii. Coloring</b>

         <p>Another technique comes from coloring, or doodling. Although this sounds very primary it is a useful tool to calm the subconscious and help the mind focus. Drawing complex pictures (such as faces) upside down force the mind even more to concentrate, which allows greater results.</p>

         <h2><a name="p06"
            id="p06"></a>Section 2:</h2>

         <h3><a name="p07"
            id="p07"></a>a. Analytical Overlay and how to avoid it:</h3>Analytical Overlay (A.O.L.) is a term often used to describe when thoughts, ideas and/or information become cross-wired or confused. When information is collected, the human brain decides to look for similar information within its memory banks.
            For Example: When remote viewing, the receiver describes the color Yellow. The brain will relate many yellow objects that it has previously experienced (bananas, the sun, canaries). This link of information happens subconsciously and cannot be fully stopped but there are ways to avoid it. One way is to
            only use descriptive words (adjectives) when describing an object. Do not use nouns as they can sometimes spoil results. For example: If I see something that is long, yellow and cylindrical, I may believe it to be a pencil, but in reality it is a garbage can.

         <p>With this problem luckily there also come other solutions. One solution which works is known as "Scribbling". Yes you will be reverted back to your read K-1 skills of drawing those great lines that everyone saw themselves in, except a bit more advanced this time. Basically how this works is you need a pad
         and paper and as you receive stuff you either draw it or make out a key, maybe one line for an adjective or two lines for nouns, and when you receive either, jot it down accordingly. The fundamentals behind this are that it helps you make a connection between physical actions and the information you receive.
         In doing so, this allows you to let your mind know that you are receiving and understanding what type of information you are receiving, so it can go ahead and do away with it. What happens to this new found space? Well, it fills up with more information about the target, in a continuous cycle of dumping and
         receiving information. Scribbling is very helpful in dumping those unwanted AOL nouns.</p>

         <h3><a name="p08"
            id="p08"></a>b. Matrix Theory to Remote viewing</h3>The matrix theory is based on the fact that everything is intertwined in a series of lines and connections. Each line is connected to something or someone by means of personal connection or merely the fact that it contains your name, therefore linking you
            to anything which might contain a part of you, such as simply your name on a sheet of paper. When someone creates a "signal" line to a target through use of coordinates, it allows the Remote viewer to connect to the target easier by traveling through the newly opened gateway than blindly searching for the
            signal to the target to make a connection. In laymen's terms you create a detour to the target, only instead of like the original route, you know the directions to this new route.

         <h3><a name="p09"
            id="p09"></a>c. Coordinate Remote Viewing</h3>So to break the ice on this expansive subject we start with probably the most widely known version of Remote Viewing, CRV, or Coordinate RV. Although it is also know by some as Controlled RV, you will see later it is easier understood as Coordinate RV.

         <p>First select a Viewer and Assigner/Monitor(one who will assign coordinates) and gather together some pictures...or refer to Psipog's database of pictures found here (<a href="images">www.psipog.net/images</a>). Once you have enough pictures you will be ready to assign some
         coordinates to them. The normal coordinate format is 0000-0000, but anything that you think guarantees the least amount of interference from outside number combinations will do. Personally I stick to the 0000-0000 format for simplicity. You will form any number combination within this format, such as
         8732-3123, and then you will need to associate in a way these coordinates with the picture you want your friend to RV. To do this you can mentally overlay coordinates on the picture (while this process works for pictures, it works best for 3d objects in everyday life) in your head and hold it in your mind or
         you can physically draw them on the sheet of paper, either yield pretty similar results. By doing so, in theory, you establish a connection line between the coordinates and the picture/object you chose, and anyone can tap the line. It is also best to start with smaller objects first then move up later on when
         both are more advanced in assigning and receiving.</p>

         <p>Next is the process of receiving, which is a bit more advanced than the job of the Assigner. The sender should sit in a comfortable position so their as little as possible interruption, and maybe in a room that is quiet and cut off the sounds of the normal day. Once comfortable and both, Receiver and
         Monitor are ready, the Monitor will select an object and assign it coordinates, then relay the coordinates to you. This is where all the action begins. Once you receive the coordinates you can choose to repeat them, stare at them, or just read them once and sit peacefully. Just as long as you acknowledge them
         for what they are, and that is, coordinates to the object you are Remote Viewing. According to a popular theory of RV, know as the Matrix theory, by reciting or taking notice of the coordinates in some way you are creating a connection to the line (also part of the Matrix theory) made earlier between the
         target and coordinates, and now you must wait to receive information via this cord.</p>

         <p>At first, information comes in spurts, sometimes in pictures, or you may even for a second be transferred to the source of the object, but that borders the line of Remote Presence (RP), so we will not deal with that here</p>

         <p>Start off with simple adjectives, explain the information you get with as simple of adjectives as you can muster from that lack-luster vocabulary. If nouns do come, push them out and mentally tell yourself you only want to receive adjectives, and maybe feelings concerning the target. If you can't stop the
         nouns...Try describing them in as many adjectives as possible instead wasting time trying to push them out. The following is an example for an ideal RVing of a red wagon. "Red rectangular shape....Circles....maybe black....long line with handle like end.....open space....maybe rectangular" then it go even
         further if it had side supports "Brown line patterns above each side". After a while of practicing this routine you will be less prone to use nouns, and use adjectives more and more, maybe further influencing the information you receive via the Signal line.</p>

         <p>Once you have become better at weeding out A.O.L. and controlling the spurts of information, you can move up in difficulty in targets, such as more complex pictures or whole areas. This is where you can reach the problem of being transferred accidentally to the location, and even though achieved my RVing
         it is mainly RPing....so I will leave that to the RP articles. This basically sums it for the technical part of using RV, so now I will leave you to the rest.</p>

         <h3><a name="p10"
            id="p10"></a>d. Advanced Remote Viewing</h3>Once you are a little more advanced in Remote Viewing, and can hit most of your targets, you might want to move on to this method of RVing. It requires no coordinates, nor does it require an extra person. With this, it allows a broader range of possibilities
            within scope of this method of RVing.

         <p>Basically this method requires a place, preferably one you have never seen before, and your Remote Viewing skills. (You can also have a friend pick an object at their house or place in his house if you don't want to do this alone.) It would also be helpful if you had a Subconscious link as described in
         <a href="art-communicating-with-subc.html">the article here</a> and your mind was relaxed.</p>

         <p>Once you have most of the previous you should be ready to continue on..... While you can always pick your own place, it is easier if you first have your friend pick an object, whether it is a whole room or an object in that room and keep it in mind. This helps make the association between who you are
         working with and what object you need to find, and makes a more defined pattern in the, if you will, Matrix (From the theory of CRV). It may help if your friend thinks about this object in its every detail to further the association, or you may find this interferes, due to ways in Telepathy and such. Find
         which works best for you and stick with it.</p>

         <p>Once the object has been established it is now your turn to take part in the Remote Viewing. So get relaxed, using your favorite method...music...dance...kill....or the method mentioned previously in Section 1 of this manual. Once relaxed you need to let yourself know your objectives, and as always your
         objective is to receive information on your target object. This is where your subconscious link, if you have one, will come in handy because you can simply tell yourself what you are looking for. But what about those who don't have a subconscious link? Simple. Think the same thoughts with the emotion of
         needing to find something. If successful, you should begin to receive <i>correct</i> information pertaining to the object you are Remote Viewing.</p>

         <h3><a name="p11"
            id="p11"></a>e. Precognitive Remote Viewing</h3>This following methods are a bit different in that they combine the branches of Precognition and Remote Viewing into one. You will be using Remote Viewing techniques to observe a future event, place, or outcome.

         <p><b><a name="p12"
            id="p12"></a>i. Multiple Targets Technique</b></p>

         <p>This method requires more than just two people, and more than likely at least a small group of friends. You will need to select someone who will be picking the two targets needed for this process, one target for yes and the other target for no, and the rest of the group will do the Remote Viewing. After
         this person is selected, they will then proceed to select the targets such as, a "Bird" for yes and a "Dog" for no. They can draw little pictures on paper or overlap the thoughts of each in your mind, whichever they feel more comfortable with and whichever brings the most favorable results. After the controls
         are set, you will need to pose a question, for example "Will it rain tomorrow?"</p>

         <p>Once you have your question comes the tricky part.....and by now most of you should know which method of RV you are best at using and incorporate it into the following. If you are best at CRV, write the question on paper, and then draw the coordinates on the same sheet of paper, or if you are better with
         ARV, then run the target question through your mind with the intention that it is what the Remote Viewers are going to see. Now have the group have a go at trying to RV the target. The descriptions of the images are crucial at this point, so choosing targets that are similar (cat, dog) are not beneficial.
         When the group members finish describing what they have seen, choose the answer which is supported with the majority of feedback.</p>

         <p><b><a name="p13"
            id="p13"></a>ii. An Individual's Technique</b></p>

         <p>This is probably the simplest of the techniques, but not always the most successful. It consists of yourself, and questions you have mixed up previously that you need answered or want to see the outcome of.</p>

         <p>Gather a list of questions you need answered or future things such as "Future home", and then write them on 5-7 sheets of paper, and then fold them nicely. Grab 5-7 envelops, and place each sheet into an individual envelope. Now comes the hardest part, mixing them up...Toss them in the air.....scatter them
         about....just mix. Once mixed, write a set of coordinates on one, and begin to RV. Record what you receive and then later open the envelope to see if it could even remotely correspond to what was written on the sheet of paper.</p>

         <h3><a name="p15"
            id="p15"></a>a. Ethics/Protection:</h3>Although the choice is completely yours to make, Remote Viewing can be used for many purposes. This manual has not been composed to tell you when and how to use remote viewing, it is an individual choice. Since Remote Viewing can be practiced any place and time, it is
            useful to know how to protect oneself from spies. The easiest and most effective way to block out remote viewing spies is with shielding. Simply create a shield and program it to deflect remote viewing attempts. The following are links to shielding articles: <a href=
            "art-psionic-shielding.html">http://psipog.net/art-psionic-shielding.html</a>, <a href="art-outline-to-shielding.html">http://psipog.net/art-outline-to-shielding.html</a>.

         <h3><a name="p16"
            id="p16"></a>b. Helpful Tips:</h3>Here are some helpful tips to help you practice and develop Remote Viewing:

         <ol>
            <li>Keep a pen and paper handy at all times. Sometimes it is easier to draw a picture of what you are viewing, than to describe it with words. Coloring is not a big concern, but shading may help the results.</li>

            <li>Use adjectives when describing the objects being viewed. Using only adjectives (such as fluffy, smooth, yellow) will help to avoid Analytical Overlay.</li>

            <li>Do not relate all of the images that are seen. Although they may relate in some way, they also may have no relation to one another at all. Relating two objects can often bring upon Analytical Overlay or destroy somewhat perfect results.</li>

            <li>Performing Remote Viewing while in a trance can help to reduce Analytical Overlay.</li>
         </ol>

         <h3><a name="p17"
            id="p17"></a>c. Final Warning:</h3>Please keep in mind that over exertion and exhaustion can become serious medical problems. If at any time you start to feel nauseous, dizzy or feel any pain, stop immediately and rest. If the pain persists seek medical attention.
