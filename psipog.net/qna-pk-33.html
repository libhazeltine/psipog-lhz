                  <p>Hi, i read rainsong article on visualization and it said that if you visualize your self playing a sport you can actually improve your skill in that sport. Now can that work for tk as well?<br />
                  i have a problem with the psiwheel. (I've been doing this for 5 months) everytime the psiwheel moves i get exccited and lose focus. any tips on trying maintain a state of mind..? also would it be wise to move on to another object if you can barely move the psiwheel??<br />
                  thanx at advance Tain.</p>

                  <p>1) I do not know of any studies for that use of the method. There probably isn't anything to be lost by trying it, though.</p>

                  <p>2) You _could_ just continue as is, and you'll eventually get bored enough with it that you won't get so excited. the excitement you are feeling right now is a normal reaction to accomplishing something "cool". Grounding is another option. Or you could try one of the forms of meditation and/or
                  trancework.</p>

                  <p>3) The Psiwheel is only one of many small toys with which you can play with PK. It is not a pre-requisite for trying other toys. Go ahead and "bop" whatever catches your fancy...just don't push too hard.</p>

                  <p>I have been practicing Telekinesis for a while now. I can move the psiwheel among a few other things. But I am have problems with unexpected happenings lately. For example, when i am in class and focusing on my work, our class television would turn on and off repeatedly. This has occured once in
                  practice. I had 2 psiwheels set up and would focus on one, it would not move but the other did and visa-versa. In a few cases both spun whcih was a great accomplishment. I guess i am saying, do you have any ideas on how to stop unexpected TK insidences. I thank you for your time and I practice often,
                  but need help with this. Thanks again.</p>

                  <p>About the only practical method I've found for preventing unwanted PK is to set a secondary Shield to interfere with it. The exact programming of the Shield in question takes a bit of trial and error, though. Good luck.</p>

                  <p>Ok, I'm in need of some serious help, either I've got like minor schizophrenia or something. I have been practicing for almost a month now and I'm not getting anything. I try moving the wheel in and out of a thin plastic cd case cover (the one that comes when you buy CDWs on the little rack). I
                  can get it to move outside of it, but the movements are extremely small and I'm almost positive that the movements are just the breeze from my breathing. I came home from work at like 2:30am one night and I couldn't get to wheel to move again (big surprise) but oddly enough I tried the cryokinesis
                  just as a variety and I dropped the water to 40 degrees Fahrenheit from right around 90 or so. I have yet to be able to perform anymore cryokinesis or PK. I have read through all the articles on Telekinesis and all the Q&amp;A and I am clueless as to why I can't do this. I picked up a guitar for the
                  first time in my life like 3 years ago and I played the first part of James Bond and some of Enter Sandman (with no previous guitar knowledge, and with like a week of work I could play a good amount of Enter Sandman). The point I'm trying to get across is that I need some suggestions or something
                  because I can usually pick up and learn most things extremely quick. Any help would be great, thanks <img src="happy.gif"

                  <p>Practice more, or try something else. Being able to pick up Guitar easily is a laudable achievement (congrats! :) ) but it is not at all the same skill as PK. If it were, either I would be able to play the guitar or I would not be able to do PK.</p>

                  <p>I read An Introduction to Telekinesis by Peebrain, and i don't quite understand how the card exercises are supposed to work, since telekinesis is the power to move objects with the mind. I can believe the dice because you are trying to make it land in a certain way, but the cards, you seem to be
                  trying to sense where the selected card is and shuffle it to the bottom of the deck, am i right?</p>

                  <p>Telekinesis (aka psychokinesis, or PK) is the ability to move or alter objects with the mind. Affecting the probability of which card will turn up next, or which card will end up on the bottom, can be done with microPK.</p>

                  <p>I used to be *really* good at spinning the psiwheel. One day I invited my friend over and introduced her to telekinesis. Together (remember, this was my friend's first try ever) we were able to knock the paper off the needle (I use a needle instead of a tack).<br />
                  Now, I can barely make it bob up and down! No matter how long or how hard I try, I cannot make it spin. It's incredibly frustrating, to say the least, considering I could do it pretty well before.<br />
                  Any suggestions? Aagh! I'm ready to throw that *#@%$! psiwheel out the window!<br />

                  <p>Well, the first thing that hits me is that you're angry. Not the best state of mind to be in. Try relaxing, taking deep breathes, chilling out for a little bit. Have some fun! I know it can be frustrating... I've had my fair share of "let's stare at the pinwheel for 4 hours!!! Yay :-|". It sucks.
                  It's frustrating. But... gotta relax. Stay calm, try to remember past events when you were successful, and try to recall what you did to make it move. Try practicing with your friend again. Don't get stuck in an angry cycle, break it up and be playful.</p>

                  <p>after a year or so of practice, ive finally moved my psiwheel. its really random though it goes back and forth. but it does spin in one direction for quite awhile. i had the AC off. but i was wondering. i did it once in front of my computer. do you think electricitiy has any effect on the
                  psiwheel? i mean there could be a pull from the screen of my computer or something.</p>
