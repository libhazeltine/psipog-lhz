<A NAME="0"><FONT SIZE=4>Have you ever created a visible one?</FONT><BR><BR>
Yes.  It's NEVER happened when I tried to make one, it's only happened when I didn't specifically say "This one is gonna be visible."  So don't try to make a visible one and don't get hung up over it... it'll happen naturally!<BR>

<A NAME="1"><FONT SIZE=4>What exactly is a psi ball supposed to look like?</FONT><BR><BR>
It doesn't have to look like anything.  I've seen shinny dots (like when you hit your head, looks kinda like gliter) and blue wavy snake things.  That's personally.  Other people that have e-mailed me have said they've seen sparks, the snake things, and fog balls (no, not frog balls <IMG SRC="../../smile.gif">).<BR>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2"><FONT SIZE=4>If I make them can the ones I make be visible to other people?</FONT><BR><BR>
I'm not sure.  I've made visible ones that I could see but no one was around to ask their opinion.  I have had e-mails of friends seeing each-others psi balls, so it's quite possible.  If I were to make an educated guess, I'd say some are visible to everyone, and some are visible to people who are into aura vision.<BR>

<A NAME="3"><FONT SIZE=4>Are they supposed to be really bright and can they light up the room?</FONT><BR><BR>
I've never heard of them being bright enough to light up a room or anything, but I believe it's possible.  People have told me it's easier to see them in the dark - maybe because they emit light rather than reflecting it... I don't know.<BR>

<A NAME="4"><FONT SIZE=4>How do you see a psi ball?</FONT><BR><BR>
The same way you see a baseball or a basketball.  You just look at it.  At least, that's all I've done.<BR>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="5"><FONT SIZE=4>How long does it take for you to get a visible psi ball?</FONT><BR><BR>
It takes me about 1 or 2 minutes to make a psi ball thats visible.  But I can't go into it thinking I want a visible one.  I usually spend 1 or 2 minutes on every psi ball, and some are just visible.  I don't think time period matters as much as the effort/emotion behind it.  This one guy said he could make visible psi balls like crazy when he was excited and hyper.  Different emotions cause different things so it's always hard to judge how long something takes.<BR>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="6"><FONT SIZE=4>Do you have real pictures of psi balls?</FONT><BR><BR>
Nope.  Theres a couple reasons why.  First, I don't have a buddy here to take the picture for me, so I'd have to make the psi ball then take the picture without losing concentration.  Second, I can't make visible psi balls on command.  I'd have to carry around a camera with me and make psi balls and when I saw one, I'd have to take the picture.<BR>

<A NAME="7"><FONT SIZE=4>How visible is a psi ball supposed to be?</FONT><BR><BR>
Sometimes I can see mine as clear as I see this keyboard in front of me.  Other times I have to look REAL hard.  Sometimes I get a glimpse - there are a lot of different degrees.<BR>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="8"><FONT SIZE=4>Is it at all possible to colorize your psi ball or make it visable to others?</FONT><BR><BR>
I'm not sure if it's possible to colorize your psi ball.  I believe it is, but I have no real proof.  The only colors I've seen are blue and white.  Blue snakes and white stars (yellow moons and green clovers <IMG SRC="../../smile.gif"> sorry, I couldn't resist!).<BR>
<A HREF="index.html">Return</A>
<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="9"><FONT SIZE=4>Is it possible to see psi balls without learning aura-vision first?</FONT><BR><BR>
Yes.  I can't see auras willfully and I've seen my psi balls.  I don't know if it was spontaneous aura vision, but I havent learned aura vision and have seen psi balls.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Summary</FONT><BR><BR>
In conclusion, don't get all hung up if you don't see your psi balls.  It's not a big deal as long as you can feel them.  If you want to see them so you can show other people, rethink your motive.  Why do you want to show other people, to make them believe?  Let them believe what they want.  If you want to make a visible one to prove to yourself that they exist, forget it.  You already know they exist so move on...<BR>
