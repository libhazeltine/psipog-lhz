                  <p>I've heard a lot of talk about how if you put your hand too close to the psiwheel, your body heat can create air currents and make it spin.</p>

                  <p>I for one would rather move it with my mind, so I was wondering: about how far away from a psiwheel should you keep your hands in order to keep it from being effected by your body heat.</p>

                  <p>I used to start with my hand super close, then once I got it spinning, I would move my hand away. Then I would stand up and back up. I've moved the pinwheel from across the room doing that. I guess just keep your hands a few feet back, and you should be ok. Perhaps you are moving heat with your
                  mind, which affects the paper? Is that not TK?</p>

                  Ok guess what? i read all your articles and Q&amp;A pages, then i went to my room with my pin-wheel,i gazed at it for like 10 mins. and it moved!Of course i ccouldn't control it yet but i need some help.I can make an Aluminum foil pin-wheel spin but i can't do it on paper?Why? also, in order for me
                  to move my pin-wheel, i need to give it a little push, why?I'm sorry but i have one more, I can't get it to start at all, is the paper harder ot move than the foil one?I know it ain't my breathing that made it spin because i was far away. Thanx for your help!</p>

                  <p>Simply put - the harder application is harder. Once you learn to do an easy exercise, as with other skills, there are harder exercises. The harder ones are harder. It's just that simple. They take more practice. It's so simple it's hard to explain <img src="blah.gif"

                  <p>Hey. I have read alot on the net about focus and that you need to be able to do it well before moving anything. I was wondering, when you focus, are you meant to clear all mental 'loudness' from your head and only imagine the object moving (so you can't actually hear your thoughts), or can you
                  hear yourself in your head asking whatever it is to move?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Focus is important to any controlled psionic activity. It is nothing more or less than concentration on one thing; in this case, the "one thing" is the psychokinetic forcing of the object to move. If you can't hear your own thoughts, then you've basically passed beyond "focus" to "hypnotic coma",
                  loosely speaking.</p>

                  <p>O Hey! It's me again sorry for bothering you.<br />
                  I can move the psi-wheel now but i was wondering, after you learn to control it, do you HAVE to move to rolling pencils or can you just start levitating the pin wheels? If so, how exactly do you levitate something? I can move the pin wheel but i just don't know how. I forget and overnight, on the
                  next day, i can't move it at all! Why?I don't know but i'm hoping you can help me! Thanx!Holla...lol</p>

                  <p>You are not required to move objects in any particular order, no. The fairly standardised curriculum in this community stems from a total lack of imagination on the part of newbies, rather than a required course of action.<br />
                  To lift something, move it upward, rather than sideways.<br />
                  If you don't know what you are doing, it is harder to correct problems. Not being able to do things the following day is often a result of one of two things: a) exhaustion and b) forgetting what/how you were doing.</p>

                  When I try to move the psiwheel and my eyes are focused on the psi wheel everything around it (the background) is blurry and moves a bit like you're dizzy. So is that normal or am i creating a sort of tunnel to the psiwheel.<br />
                  Thanks, i find it hard to concentrate on the psiwheel when the rest moves a bit (always thinking that my psiwheel moved)</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have recently started practicing Telekenesis and would like to know if I am doing something wrong. I know results aren't instant, but I feel I might being doing TK wrong. Here's my procedure:<br />
                  Rather than drawing energy from an imaginary source, I put my hand on an electrical appliance such as a computer and pretend that it is feeding me energy. That seems to work. Next, I direct that energy through my arm and up into my head, then I redirect it to both my right and left arms. I keep the
                  flow steady though I am disconnected from my chosen source. Then I send the energy between me and the object and connect to it. I pretend to see what the object sees, yada yada yada. Once I am connected, I imagine I am pushing it in the desired direction. I have had minimal success on the psiwheel
                  and next to no success on pushing/pulling a different object. As I said, I understand the skill comes in time, but I need to know if I am doing something wrong before I make myself want to give up. So, am I doing anything wrong?</p>

                  <p>First of all, I would suggest _not_ running the "energy" to your head. There is no need, and if you are in fact accomplishing anything, you may be causing damage. Nerve-damage in the central nervous system is _not_ fun.<br />
                  Clearly there is more than one workable method to performing standard run-of-the-mill psychokinesis. Many of them do not require the sort of intimate contact with the target which you are describing. Why not just whap the psiwheel upside the paper with a puff of psi-stuff. Or extend a stream of
                  densely-compacted psi-stuff at one corner, in a sort of psionic bank-shot?</p>

                  <p>When you make a psi ball do you have your eyes open?</p>

                  <p>do you have to see a psi ball to make it move if not then how can you make it move somewhere?</p>

                  <p>Everytime i try to move something with my mind it doesnt budge do i have to close my eyes?</p>

                  <p>How come these people who have these powers dont prove their skill on big television shows?</p>

                  <p>What is the biggest thing ever moved with telekinesis?</p>

                  <p>If you'd read most of this section, you'd see that many of your questions have been answered already, at least once.</p>

                  <p>No, your eyes can be open or closed when making a psiball. It makes no difference at all.</p>

                  <p>You don't have to see it to move it. Check the appropriate section of "Articles" and read the psiball articles again.</p>

                  <p>Closing your eyes is not required for PK (ie moving something with your mind). However, it is neither a common skill nor a particularly easy one, and it is quite possible that you'll never be able to do it. Contrarywise, perhaps you'll get it to work tomorrow.</p>

                  <p>There are various reasons for _not_proving themselves on TV. One of the obvious ones is that they wish to maintain a low profile. Another obvious one is that they have no overwhelming desire to prove it. Some of us don't care whether other folk believe in psionics, gravity, seawater, or
                  housecats.</p>

                  <p>The largest thing ever moved with telekinesis is at least as big as a sofa/chesterfield/couch.</p>
