<FONT SIZE=+1>December 14th, 2002 PK Party</FONT>
<P>
As far as I know, this is the first time anyone has ever done anything like this.  A normal
PK Party is a gathering of people, at a physical location, where they have a small party and
try to bend silverware using psychokinesis (hence "PK Party").  The original idea comes from
a guy named <A HREF="http://www.jackhouck.com/">Jack Houck</A>, and PK Parties have become
pretty popular.
<P>
Since we can't really have a bunch of kids from all over the world meet at one spot, we
decided to meet in the PsiPog chat room and see if we could reproduce
the PK Party, but online instead.
<P>
I led the event, but really I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to bending
silverware, so all I did was summarize the method on <A HREF="http://www.fork-you.com/">Fork-You.com</A>
and hung out with everyone else.  RetroKat (the webmaster of <A HREF="http://www.fork-you.com/">Fork-You.com</A>)
came and helped us out, and gave us some tips too.  A few people had results, and the images
are below.
<P>
Below are the pictures I received from the chatters.  Could they be fake?  Maybe.  Make up
your own mind.
