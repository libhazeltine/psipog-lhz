                  <p>Learning to make psiballs first is not required. However, if you are learning from a site like this, it is a good idea to read the essays about the most basic activities first, such as Psiballs and Pings, because many of the other essays assume knowledge that might not otherwise be present.
                  Learning to make the psiball is not needed; reading and understanding the procedure is. Otherwise, many other essays here will not make sense.</p>

                  <p>hi. I'm currently teaching someone PSI. however, when he focuses his energy, he can't seem to easily release it from his body. His body parts stop moving, get stiff, and turn red, then black. When he lets up it goes back to normal. However, after that he starts almost floating, where he is just
                  barely touching the floor. the energy blew out his TV and later he focused it in a blast and vaporized a box. He still has trouble with getting his body to release the energy though, and i fear he may hurt himself. He has also fainted after successfullly doing pyrokinesis. He can't stop doing it
                  because he is a natural and it keeps happening. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>If he is a "natural", as you claim, then the obvious suggestion is to start by teaching him how to _stop_ the effects rather than producing new ones. Your note is unclear as to the ability in which he is "natural", however. Specific suggestions must await a more specific question. Dealing with
                  clairvoyance, for example, is different from dealing with psychokinesis.</p>

                  <p>If focusing his "energy" causes the symptoms you say, suggest he _not_ focus his "energy". Focus implies intent. He can stop doing this, at least. If not, I would strongly suggest he obtain the services of a mental-health professional.</p>

                  <p>Fainting after doing Pyrokinesis would not be strange; he'd need a snack. On the other hand, if he cannot release "energy" from his body, how did he affect the object upon which his Pyrokinesis acted?</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I was wondering, If someone starts Telekinesis/Psychokinesis, should you have a firm base foundation in energy manipulation or is that just essential in Telepathy? Should it be treated as a pre-requisite to Telepathy, or everything? Where should one start if they were to do Telekinesis, and if it
                  is Energy Manipulation, to what extent (example: mastery of psi-balls, mastery of shields, etc)? Also, should Psychokinesis be learnt before learning something like Aerokinesis, Pyrokinesis, or Cryokinesis, or would having Psychokinesis give you the skill to do those three? Thank you for taking the
                  time to answer this!</p>

                  <p>Learning Energy Manipulation first is not required. If someone else is teaching you, it makes it easier for him/her to explain some things. In the same vein, knowing what's in the Energy Manipulation section of this site, will make figuring out the PK section simpler.</p>

                  <p>Psychokinesis _includes_ Aerokinesis, Pyrokinesis, and Cryokinesis, so that is a bit like asking whether you need to learn Mathematics before learning to Add and Subtract. <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>The effort involved in psionic activity affects the body, whether or not you actually accomplish anything. Some of the effects are barely noticed, in small attempts such as Shapes-and-Colours games, or a couple minutes of staring-contests with your Psiwheel. However, a serious sustained effort
                  will affect your blood sugar (drops it, generally, but there are exceptions to this), potassium, and so on. Any intelligent diabetic person can explain in detail what happens to your body when the blood sugar drops suddenly. Hint: it is bad.</p>

                  <p>The kind of large-scale psychokinetic effects that were hinted at in the post under discussion are the kind that have an annoying tendency to bring you to your knees --literally-- shaky, exhausted, and quite possibly in immediate danger to your life depending on the severity of the individual
                  incident. And that's just the sugar part.</p>

                  <p>A severe drop in blood potassium can cause such inconveniences as cardiac arrest....cardiac arrest -&gt; your heart stops -&gt; unhealthy.</p>

                  <p>This kind of effect is not restricted to attempts at lifting large objects. Sustained effort even in "small" things such as long-distance scanning will do it, if maintained long enough. This is, actually, one of the reasons that folks in chatrooms have reason to refuse requests for such scans.
                  Those requests tend to come in groups large enough to endanger the person doing the scanning, if s/he complies with all of them.</p>

                  <p>I haven't started with TK yet, i've tried like 3 days but without results.I was reading a guide for newbies (from not_important) and it said that we should be careful with TK because it is very dangerous i.e. someone could make an artery explode on someone's head, that could eventually kill him. I
                  knew TK could be dangerous but not that much. Does that means that if i learn to do TK and then i get very mad with someone i could accidentaly do some serious damage to him (unvoluntaryly)? I dont think i would do it and i try to convince myself but when i try to do the psiwheel experiment i keep
                  thinking on the situation and can't concentrait. This danger stuff puts me nervous during the expriments.<br />
                  Another think that impulses me (unvoluntatiely)in not been able to concentrate is thinking about how would people(even my friends who don't believe in TK or this stuff)would react or even call me freak, i start thinking on that (when i dont want to) and can't concentrate(i know people who do TK are
                  not freak but some people has a very closed mind). How could i stop thinking on that for that not to be an impediment?<br />
                  Also, does any of the people (people you know, or anyway the people who can answer the Q&amp;A questions) regrets having learned this abilities (TK or other)? (like not_important sais regreting, in his article "Advanced TK: How to succed")<br />

                  <p>The "freak" situation has happened in several cases that I know of. The easiest way around this, for a newbie, is to resist the temptation to show off in public.</p>

                  <p>As for being dangerous, PK is more dangerous to the person doing it than to bystanders. The risk to your own life starts _long_ before you can manage PK effects likely to cause damage --accidental or otherwise-- to anyone else.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hi. This is a bit long so pardon me for taking much of your time, but its very important to me. I have a few stuff that is bothering me and am not sure if its my psychic senses such as empathy or I'm just a paranoid person. To start off I'm basically diagnosed as being partial delusional. I take
                  prescription Geodon because of a special "incident" that happened to me. Basically, I bought a car magazine and I felt really weird. Basically, I had so much energy and I could feel my pulse beating abonormally quickly. I also noticed I had slight increases in strength tasks like being able to lift
                  heavy objects I wouldn't be able to do normally. I notice I have a strange craving to buy a red piece of clothing and I would go to the mall and buy a red hat or something. I also had the unfortunate incidents of actually hearing what seemed to be gunshots outside my house. Now, the weird thing is I
                  don't "hear" things like how certain people who actually are diagnosed for hallucinating, but when I go outside I noticed I can't find where these gunshots are coming from, what exactly they are, I don't see any physical evidence of anything electronic or people making these sounds. But yes, I can
                  confirm of these sounds being real because my neighbor indirectly asked me what was going and I told him about buying a car design magazine to explain what was going on. The strange thing is I just threw away the magazine and these sounds wouldn't happen anymore. I also wouldn't have a pulse of 200
                  bpm anymore.<br />
                  I know it sounds like I might be paranoid and my psychiatrist is correct in identifying me as having a mild case of schizophrenia, but these things ONLY happen when I buy that specific magazine.</p>

                  <p>My second concern is I notice when I'm in the classroom in college I tend to have a weird feeling of paranoia and excitement and it totally affects me so much that I have major problems finishing my degree because of this. (Imagine starting college in 1997 and as of 2004 have only passed 2
                  classes!)<br />
                  I've been given Paxil to combat this, but I still can't handle sitting in the classroom being a student and I'm always thinking there are students in my classroom trying to "set me up" by throwing subliminal gestures or saying weird things. For example, in my Tai Chi class I notice at the end of one
                  session one of the students I normally chatted with told me "I think you lost..." I have no clue what exactly what he was talking about and can't come up with a possible explanation and it just leaves me with this sickly feeling of me being setup thus adding to my paranoia.<br />
                  I don't know I just need some advice from anyone if you guys think any of this has something to do with anything within the subject of psychics, ki energy, paranormal or I'm just plain paranoid.</p>

                  <p>Hey there, me again:)<br />
                  I must admit I have never heard of biokinesis before. Now I'm interested in trying it but I can't find your articles on it...:(. I hope you don't mind if I ask you a few questions about it.<br />
                  1) Can you use biokinesis to alter your appearance to look like someone else?</p>

                  <p>2) Regarding my previous question about changing sex, you said it would take serious structural and hormonal changes. If someone were to do such a thing, how would you know you're doing it right? Is there a certain sensation to look for is it more of a will it and let nature do it thing?</p>

                  <p>3) Where ARE your articles on it? (Do you have any?)</p>

                  <p>4) How would you go about it? (What are the basics, etc.)</p>

                  <p>5) OK this is about regular PK, I was doing great but over a week ago I have stopped showing any results, in fact- I can't do it! No matter how hard I try! I haven't overworked myself, I don't really need to meditate (I don't let things get to me and my mind stays blank when I want it to...) Do
                  you know what happened? Do other people get this? Is there a cure?</p>

                  <p>"Biokinesis" it a political theory. A quick web-search ought to get you some interesting pages about it.</p>

                  <p>The slang use of it, meaning "using PK to affect living tissue" derives from the gaming community, and is a logical construction...but is incorrect.</p>

                  <p>Now, to the questions at hand:</p>

                  <p>1) If you are sufficiently skilled, it is possible to affect your own tissue to a considerable degree. I'd read about one chap who could make a mole appear on his hand, then go away again, for example. He used it as a demonstration of what the mind can do. I don't recall the name at the
                  moment.</p>

                  <p>2) I've never made such an attempt, nor have I heard of anyone else doing so. However, if you don't know the finer points of the structural and hormonal alterations --not to mention the gross mutation of the chromosomes-- you are more likely to cause serious problems, than to achieve your
                  objective safely. (Those serious problems could include the same kind of slow painful death that plagued early attempts at _in vivo_ genetic engineering.) How do you know you did it right? If you end up being a member of the opposite sex, and you remain relatively healthy afterward, you did it right.
                  If you die in the process, or immediately after, you messed up. If you keep your original "plumbing" or end up with some kind of combination of male and female, you messed up.</p>

                  <p>4) The "basics" would be to study Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry, to start with, so you'd have the beginnings of a clue as to what you were getting into. After that, skill in Psychokinesis would be required.</p>

                  <p>Combat is not a topic here for several reasons. The simplest of these is that Peebrain has decided to exclude it from the acceptable topics on this site. His site, his rules.</p>

                  <p>If you are a beginner and run into some presence that wanted to harm you, chances are that if your Shields are not good enough to defend you, any attack form you attempt will accomplish nothing beyond annoying that "presence" further.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have noticed in a number of places when someone asks what the "purpose" of a psiball is, one answer that seems to pop up sometimes is 'cat toys'. Since I am not advanced enough to be able to effectively make my constructs stay after I have made them, I am wondering if this is true and if anyone
                  has ideas on why they make good cat toys.</p>

                  <p>It almost sounds as if cats can see them or sense them in some way in order to play with them. I feel that this is possible because a cat's senses are generally more advanced then ours...just wondering if someone had thoughts on this.</p>

                  <p>If cats could not sense them, they would not make good cat toys. The idea comes up repeatedly because a lot of us live with cats. Drop a psishape on the floor where Kitty can see it, and watch her reaction.</p>

                  <p>I actually just got a cat from my sister, and tried this out. The cat went nuts! I couldn't tell if the cat was playing with the construct, or afraid of the construct. I'll have to mess around a little more.</p>
