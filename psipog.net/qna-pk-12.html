                  <p>Hello. I've read all the articles about TK and I've tried practicing the psiwheel exercise. It just won't work. I've cleared my mind; nothing. I tried 'willing' it to happen; nothing. I've tried visualizing; nothing. What can I do to help me with my practice?<br />

                  <p>In one of your articles "Advanced Telekinesis: How to Succeed by Not_Important"</p>

                  <p>You wrote this: I've had much luck, but I've also practiced many hours. "The chance favors the prepared mind" hehe. The biggest thing I can move is a chair. And no, I CANT'T levitate anything I think I have got good genes for TK stuff, therefore don't be sad if you can't move chairs after 9
                  months.</p>

                  <p>"NI" says he CAN?T levitate things but in you media section there's a picture of "NI" levitating a knife. How is this possible?</p>

                  <p>I don't want to judge you of any thing because I thing your site is great I was just wondering. J</p>

                  <p>You've probably heard this question before, and you're probably sick of it (And ones like it.) but here goes anyway. First off, I was thinking about how one would actually kill someone with PK. The conclusion I came to was that you would need to somehow damage a person's internal organs
                  sufficiently. That got me thinking, has this ever actually happened? Just as poltregeists are thought to be random acts of PK, are there any deaths or causes of death throughout history that could be from some malevolent psionic? Not the best thing to be thinking about when starting off, I know, but
                  the 'dark side' (If you will) of psionics is something I feel should be learned about, if only to avoid doing harm to yourself or others.</p>

                  <p>I've been practiceing TK for over a month. When i try to move my psi wheel. It appears to be moving but when i asked my friend if it was moving and it looked to be moving for me, he said it wasn't moving at all. Is this some kind of the way your eye percepts things, or is this just i'm some
                  concentrated on moveing it that my mind believes that it's seeing the object moveing?</p>

                  <p>Goes it seem to spin, or does it seem to wobble or move back-and-forth slightly? If the latter, it is an optical illusion. The effect is known as autokinesis, and is related to eye fatigue.</p>

                  <p>I have hear that if you can do tk, then you can levitate something, since it uses the same thing. I think it was rainsong that said this. Is there anything that is different when you try to levitate then when you try to spin something?</p>

                  <p>Yes. The direction. To levitate, you go "up"; to spin, you go "around".</p>

                  <p>Levitating also needs to use sufficient force to counter the force of gravity. Spinning a psiwheel doesn't need as much force, if it is well-designed, because there is not much friction.</p>

                  <p>I did a search and I didn't find an full answer to my question so here it goes.</p>

                  <p>I get the psi-wheel to spin, sometimes fast sometimes slow. When I am finished my hands are warm and I came to the conclusion that it was just the heat moving the psi wheel. Lately i've been trying moving my hands back farther away from the psi wheel and It still spins but not as fast. When im
                  done this time my hands are hotter than ever before. Then I asked myself why would my hands gain so much heat without that little if any movement.</p>

                  <p>Is this still TK because im controlling my body heat to a fixed point in or around my body?</p>

                  <p>If your hands get really hot, then it sounds like it might be from your hands. Stick your hands in your pocket, and keep practicing <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"

                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />. Force your body to figure out an alternate solution. Or, if you want to control the heat on your hands, practice what you're doing more (though I assume you don't want to do that). When I first started, I used my hands, but then I would pull them away slowly. I could get
                       the pinwheel to spin if I convinced myself that my hands were close, even if they wern't. I would say to myself, "Nothing has changed, my hands are right next to the pinwheel" (even though they wern't), and it would start to spin. Keep practicing, experimenting, and trying new things <img src=
