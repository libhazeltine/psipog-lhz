                  <p>What constitutes "sometimes"? Light bulbs _do_ burn out periodically, of course, regardless of who turns them on or off. If the glass itself is shattering frequently, advise your friend to purchase better bulbs, and to make sure they are the right kind for the sockets in question, and for local
                  conditions.</p>

                  <p>Ok, This is a long and possibly complicated question. So let me get started. When I was little my mind was always kind of diffrent then others. I always thought about things diffrently, and as I've been growing my minds been changing. I've started to hear things like peoples voices and thoughts in
                  my head and well I didnt control it, it just happened, and about a year ago I relized I had started feeling other peoples feelings mixed in with mine. I've always seemed to be able to tell what kinda mood someone is in even if they were hiding it but I never thought much of it when I was smaller, but
                  now im acctually feeling what they feel. and I dont know how to control this stuff yet, it always just happened. And if i am daydreaming and looking at something such as a piece of paper or an open door it would move like wiggle or shake a little. Other things have happened but i dont feel like
                  pestering you with those right now. Please helpif you can and tell me what might be going on.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are a few things that <i>could</i> be going on.</p>

                  <p>The first one is that you <i>could</i> be crazy. I know, I know, you don't think you're crazy, but it is a possibility. I could be crazy too - it's just one of those things you have to keep asking yourself to keep yourself in check. So put everything else on pause for a few minutes and do a self
                  check to see if you're crazy or not.</p>

                  <p>If you discover that you might be crazy, then go get professional help.</p>

                  <p>If you honestly think you're sane, and all that other stuff is going on, then I would suggest learning to either: 1. stop it, or 2. control it. I'm not exactly sure how you would go about stopping it because I personally choose to control it.</p>

                  <p>So... finally I might be able to help you. If you are not crazy, and you want to control it, then my advice is to learn how to shield. Read up on psi balls, then constructs, then shielding. After that, read up on empathy and telepathy stuff, and it sounds like you might have some geisting problems
                  too (which is slang for psychokinesis control issues). Shields are your friend.</p>

                  <p>Also - don't be afraid to experiment. Learn more about what you can do, and learn what triggers it. Learn how it works, and try to see if certain emotions cause certain things to happen. Keep a journal.</p>

                  <p>I don't know how "normal" it is, but I experienced the same thing. While practicing energy manipulation, I sort of just got empathy without even trying. The skills are linked in some unknown way, and if you're good in one, you'll probably be able to pick up another with less trouble.</p>

                  <p>Do you guys consider sparring a friendly match or rather some kind of serious combat? I hear that by sparring you can exchange shields with someone and get some cool tips, but is it safe? Should I be well shielded if I try it?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I consider sparring to be combat. I used to be a little less strict about it, until I witnessed first hand some kids sparring, and one kid hurting another kid by accident. I'd rather not have PsiPog shut down over something like that, so I keep the rule strict. Accidents happen. People miss, and
                  hit others who aren't sparring. People over do something, and do damage.</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I have looked through the Q&amp;A section of your site, and have found one question which is similar to what I want to ask, but doesn't answere my question. <a href="qna.html"
                     target="_blank">qna.html#view=1&amp;viewid=648</a></p>

                  <p>In the answere to this question, Rainsong said at one point "If you are trying to learn psionics, you need your nervous system to function correctly. Mucking it up is stupid."<br />
                  I would like to know what you base this upon as the effects of some drugs increase the responsiveness of your nervous system as well as your ability to access and use your subconciouss mind. Would you be able to give me some sources on this?<br />
                  I would also like to know specifically which recreational drugs were tested and what the actuall problems and advantages are.<br />
                  I have been experimenting a lot lately with a couple of recreational drugs which have given me a much greater psionic ability, I would like to compare my information to yours.</p>

                  <p>Thankyou,<br />
                  Ps. I would like to apologise for questioning your answere, I didn't mean to disrespect, just get a more precise answere.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>I'll address your post-script first. Asking for clarification is not disrespectful. There is no problem there. The way you phrased your question makes it reasonably clear that you, at least, _read_ the initial answer.</p>

                  <p>There were more than a hundred drugs tested, in several series of tests, conducted by several organizations. I do not, however, have the details handy at the moment. If/when I unpack them (I'm in the process of moving house), I'll edit this message.</p>

                  <p>There are quite a few drugs that _seem_ to enhance a person's sensitivity and/or contact with the subconscious, but when their results are looked at by a sober observer, or the percipient him/herself once the drug wears off, turn out to be useless gibberish. Some psionic abilities are more easily
                  tested objectively than others: psychokinesis and telepathy, for example, are easier to evaluate than construct-making and "psi-generation". Consider, therefore, which of your psionic abilities are --or appear to be-- enhanced, and what evidence there is for this. Any drug that affects how your mind
                  operates will affect your judgement. By definition, any drug that affects how "you" interact with your subconscious mind therefore affects how your mind operates.</p>

                  <p>I _cannot_ recommend experimenting with recreational drugs for any purpose, for several reasons. One of these is a simple matter of lack of regulation, it being an illegal activity: you do not really know that the drug you have purchased is, in fact, what the dealer claims it is, or whether it has
                  been mixed with anything else. Those are variables your "experiments" need to account for.</p>

                  <p>When it comes to effects of recreational drugs on psionics, caffeine has variable results. In more general terms, the additives that adulterate tobacco cigarettes should be enough to give you pause for thought. Alcohol and assorted less-legal depressants have been known to give the impression of
                  increasing psionic sensitivity, but tests tend not to bear this out. The tests in question were generally not run by people interested in discouraging other people from using the substances in question, by the way.</p>

                  corner of your eye? Investigate.</p>
