                  <p>you don't believe in religous shit? what about the links to wicca sites and shit like that? wicca is fake and stupid. just like any all 'right-hand path religions'. for example, the way they attempt to answer/justify when people ask 'why were people taken to court for witchcraft if wicca is not
                  bad witchcraft?'. an idiot poser like you psipog fags on tv replies, 'because SOME of them were already psychopaths in their own ways and stuff like that'</p>

                  <p>the stargate program and shit like that aren't good things, dumbasses. they're involved with government, blah blah like that, so HAVING COMMON SENSE, YOU SHOULD KNOW. your chat page talks about common sense. funny, you haven't talked about your common sense.</p>

                  <p>We seperate psionics completely from religion - in fact, one of the goals of this website is to avoid religious connections. The psionics you see presented here is based on science and experiments. As you can see, none of our articles reference "demons", "spirits", the "devil", "God", or anything
                  like that. If you have specific questions about your religion, I suggest you ask a priest/nun in your area.</p>

                  <p>Hi, me again, now that a bot is active in the chat, and the possibility to login in from a mirc client again, is it possible to add a web-based client to chat ?, like some java add-in in the website and login from there. E.g you can use the login name from psipog website as the login for the
                  chat?</p>

                  <p>Because we get a LOT of people who come to the chat and ask questions without reading any of the articles. By forcing people to be a member for two weeks, it:<br />
                  1. Makes sure they are somewhat serious (i.e., not just something they're curious about for a day, and then done with it)<br />
                  2. Makes sure they have read some articles, so they have some basic knowledge.<br />
                  3. Prevents people from evading bans easily.</p>
