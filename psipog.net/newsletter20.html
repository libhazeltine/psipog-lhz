PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance

Newsletter #20, for October 16th, 2005

"Intuition is the supra-logic that cuts out all the routine
processes of thought and leaps straight from the problem to the
answer."
- Robert Graves


Dear PsiPog Users,

Yo! In case you couldn't tell, the entire layout of PsiPog.net
has been updated :-). I personally think it's a big improvement.
I am also updating the internal structure of PsiPog.net to work
more smoothly, and you should see small results of that when I
switch it over (some time in the future).

Let's jump into the mail bag...

"I had a question about what Yev said in the 19th newsletter:

>> Yev writes: "...I have always wondered why you never touch on
>> the mirror aspect of the supernatural."

What's the mirror thing?"

My comments: This topic isn't really part of PsiPog, but if
you're curious you can do searches on google for Scrying.

"I read what Psiballer wrote and wanted to add something that
happened to be on my first known OBE. At the time I was still
living in San Diego and lived alone. I had several friends and we
practiced energy work together. I had read several things on OBE
and was practicing it DAILY and more without much luck. I could
not seem to slow my physical brain down enough to be able to go
into the OBE.

I had had a hard day and was a little tired. I have this really
great comfy couch that I many times would sleep on. I laid down
with my arm around one of my pillows and started to watch a
comedy sitcom. These usually can help bring me down and relax.
BUT this time I had started feeling my hand waving around
FREELLY. It was a really cool feeling too. The next thing I could
start feeling my feet sort of kicking free and played with that
for a few seconds. The next thing was I was laying there watching
the things I had on my walls go by and floating up in a diagonal.
This happened for 5-10 seconds and I got scared and slammed back
into my body (not the right thing to do LOL). Every nerve in my
body suddenly came alive and was tingling like mad. This took a
while to settle down before I could do much more. This was the
first time I was able to calm myself to the point that the OBE
could happen. Everybody has a "something" than can calm their
mind and body to that degree. the trick is finding what that
something is."

My comments: Cool! Thanks for sharing :-).

"I haven't yet successfully made a psi-ball. But I was wondering,
would it be possible to draw energy from your source to form a
psi-ball, and then store it by allowing the psi-ball to stay with
you, like orbiting you or something, so that when you need it,
it's there to be used?"

My comments: Yes! In fact, this is what a shield does :-).
Except it doesn't orbit, it just kinda sits there :-P. But yes,
that is definitly possible, and is used by some psions.

Moonman writes:
"I think I have some information that you would enjoy to know. I
have been studying OOBEs for a while now, and have collected some
useful information.

During an OOBE:
1. My psi powers are greater than that of my normal ones.
2. I can increase my psi abilities faster than when in the real
world (as if I was practicing for a week in only one night).
3. I have found it possible to remember something from the real
world, such as something that somebody said that has importance
to what I am seeing.
4. I have created a flared psiball, and seen it when I got back
to the real world. I can then manipulate it."

My comments: I can relate to number 2 and 3, but number 1 and 4
I found the opposite in one of my experiences. I tried creating
a psi ball (once), and couldn't even get a sensation. I felt
nothing when I tried to make one. That was my only experience
with it though, so it's not really enough to say one way or the
other :-P. Perhaps some readers out there have experiences?

"I was wondering, what dangers are there in having an out of body
experience. High Octane energy can have devastating effects and I
don't want to be 'that guy who floated away and evaporated in the
sun.' *grin*"

My comments: Heh :-). Well, I can tell you what I know, and what
I believe.

What I know: nothing. I have no clue how OBEs work, and
therefore have no idea on the risks involved.

What I believe: I believe that I am safe. I've convinced myself
of this by facing my fears, accomplishing OBEs in spite of the
risks, then experimenting on my own.

"Hello all! I recently found some kids at school who are members
of PsiPog (w00t!!!) and was wondering, is it easier to practice
TP in close range or far range? Also, all of my friends, and I,
are having difficulty with TK. We have all read the articles, and
the most successful of us has managed to make a string twitch. If
you could give us some pointers please? Thank you!"

My comments: It is my experience that telepathy while looking at
the person is a lot easier. I believe this is because I can
track their thoughts better and plot them against their actions.
For example, if I get a confusing thought, I can make it fit into
what they are doing, and things make sense. But hey, it sounds
like you got some friends to experiment with, so test things out
and see if you notice a difference :-).

I don't have a lot of tips for TK that aren't written in the
articles. But - there is an article that isn't on PsiPog.net
that you might find useful. Surf to http://www.upconline.net and
look for Float's article on psychokinesis.

"I've been able to do OBEs since I was young. However, now when
I do them on purpose, in the middle of exiting my body, I
suddenly realize that I've completely stopped breathing. I
re-enter my body, and I'm wide awake, but my body isn't taking
any breaths automatically. It's not that my breathing slows down
or gets very shallow; I'm used to that. This is extremely
alarming, since it used to not happen. Also, when I occasionally
do it by accident, I do just fine with my breathing! This only
happens when I leave my body on purpose.

Does anyone have any suggestions about how to make sure I keep
breathing when I do OBEs?"

My comments: I'm not exactly sure what is going on, but I do have
a similar experience. I was investigating this same thing while
trying to OBE - I was curious as to what happens to my breathing
when I leave my body, because I knew when I was out of body that
my body must continue breathing, but I wasn't aware of it. When
I focused on my breathing, and tried to leave my body, it felt
almost like my breathing was fading out. It was insanely scary
to leave while my breathing seemed to fade out... but I did it
anyways and everything was fine. I'm not sure what is happening
in your case, but this is what I believe is happening from your
small description: I think at one point you monitored your
breathing while leaving your body (perhaps just by accident), and
you noticed that you stopped breathing (while in reality, your
BODY was still breathing, but you were becoming less aware of
it). This created a new fear inside of you that emerges when you
try to OBE - you think to yourself, "Wow, I hope I don't stop
breathing again!" - and you begin to monitor your breathing to
make sure. But the same thing happens, and you panic and return.

This wasn't a problem earlier because the fear didn't exist, and
you wern't monitoring it. Does my idea make sense? My
suggestion is to OBE anyways, for a short period of time. Say,
30 seconds. If your body isn't breathing for 30 seconds, that's
ok and you'll survive, but when you return you should be gasping
for air. If you return and your body is fine, then go a little
longer next time - do this until you are OBE'ing for a long time,
and at that point you know for a fact that your body must be
breathing on it's own.
