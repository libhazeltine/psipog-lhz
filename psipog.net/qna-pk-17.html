                  <p>I see that you don't have any articles on electrokinesis. First of all, does that mean you don't believe in it or that you just don't have sufficient information on the subject? Second question: if the answer to the first was the latter answer, does everyone have the ability to develop
                  electrokinesis or do only certain people have that gift? Thanks.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>"Electrokinesis" is a word stemming from role-playing games. It _can_ be used to describe a rather large assortment of psychokinesic effects. The chap who claims to be a natural "electrokinetic" has yet to elaborate on exactly which PK effects he does.</p>

                  <p>That said, generally folks have either or both of two sets of skills in mind when they refer to "electrokinesis": microPK interference with electronic systems such as computers, and running or otherwise altering the function of electrical appliances (usually, but not always, with macroPK).
                  _Sometimes_ they are referring to the quasi-telepathic effects of linking with and probing computer systems.</p>

                  <p>In any event, other than listing the applications, there hasn't seemed much point in writing about this specific subcategory of PK.</p>

                  <p>As for your second question, there is insufficient data available to give a definitive answer. Quite a lot of people have been able to learn to accomplish minor PK effects. However, to say that everyone has the ability to do so is premature. Among those currently practicing, there is a wide range
                  of skill: from moved a very small object once or skewed the stats significantly one day to serious and reliable PK at a large scale. The time taken to learn these things ranges from a few minutes to a couple decades.</p>

                  <p>Presumably, your _real_ question there is "Can I, VampWitch, learn to do this?" The only real answer is: "Try it and find out."</p>

                  <p>Psychokinetic messings-about with computer programs is pretty common, really. Try the butterfly game, or the moving tile game, at the Garden of Dreams, to start out ( www.psiarcade.com/garden ). The moving tile game might _seem_ like it would go the "right" way anyway, but it is not the case. And
                  yes, they are pseudo-random java script kind of things, nothing especially odd about the game programs themselves. <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>I should refer you to the "rant" section, but to save time and effort, I'll simply re-state it here:</p>

                  <p>Psychokinesis is a physical activity, and its use affects your body. Your question is equivalent to "I decided I needed to start getting some exercise so I ran a five-mile race this morning, and I was tired afterward. Why?"</p>

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>I recently found a document on the internet called "Unleash your telekinetic ability."</p>

                  <p>In one part it was written that if you have bad aura you should not learn TK.</p>

                  <p>"A bad aura is easy to recognize. If you have three or more of the following, then do not read the rest of this document.</p>

                  <p>? Ringing sounds and/or hearing voices in your left ear</p>

                  <p>? Recurring nightmares or sleep disorders</p>

                  <p>? Most areas of the white part of the eyes are mainly a light red to dark red color</p>

                  <p>? Inability to stop thinking. Refer to the definition of focus.</p>

                  <p>? High levels of recurring headaches, migraine headaches, muscle cramps, stabbing pain, and other areas of discomfort</p>

                  <p>? Constant arguing, heavy usage of any type of medication, drinking lots of alcohol, caffeine, smoking drugs and/or smoking cigarettes.</p>

                  <p>The majority would like to say that telekinesis is negative in nature. In practice, telekinesis cannot be utilized consciously with negative PSI energy.<br />
                  If you are unsure about your aura then do not read this document. Instead, you can also talk to an empath on the Internet. You should ask an empath to read your aura to determine if your aura is good or bad. Ask an empath for references.<br />
                  Once again, the author stresses the dangers of attempting to learn telekinesis in bad aura."</p>

                  Is this true or is it just ****?</p>

                  <p>Either "out of psi-stuff" or simply too exhausted to use what psi-stuff was available. Psionics is a set of physical skills, and the body has limits to its stamina. Even "simple" things like scanning are more tiring than you'd expect. To replenish your "oomph", rest for a while, eat properly,
                  pretty much what you'd do to recover from strenuous athletic activity, even if you don't actually "feel" that tired. It sneaks up on you, like the kind of exhaustion felt after cramming for an exam, but your body might decide "enough" before you feel like you're going to crash.</p>
