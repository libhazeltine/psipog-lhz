                  <p>Psi: second-to-last letter of the Greek alphabet, used as a variable to denote an unknown mechanism involved in telepathy and psychokinesis, in American research in the early-mid 20th century. By extension, it is also used to refer to the "stuff" used to accomplish pk and telepathy, and --by
                  further extension-- other effects...and sometimes those who produce such effects.</p>

                  <p>Psions: from "psionics", unofficial. Denotes both people who use psionics, and a hypothetical particle which might be connected to the mechanism by which psionics is accomplished.</p>

                  <p>Psionics: Americanism coined in parallel with "electronics", "nucleonics", etc. Refers to deliberate use of the "mind" to affect physical reality. Both the set of skills, and the use thereof. By extension, it has come to include the perceptive "psychic" abilities, as well.</p>

                  <p>Hey! I just read a formula reasearched by some Conrad guy who researched on telekinesis for 20 years...<br />
                  TK = CFe + ZPE - SD - E+<br />
                  It means that Telekinesis (TK) is the result of a sufficiently high amount of Iron in the brain (CFe), of a Zero Point Emotion (ZPE) state, not using energy on will power or imagination or anything, and it is reduced by any degree of Sleep Deprivation (SD), and reduced by any degree of excesss
                  vitamin E (E+) as that reduces the iron.<br />

                  <p>There are enough "Questionable" parts of his paper to make the whole thing practically worthless. His formula, as presented, is without meaning.

                  I understand that you have done experiments on, and analysed, blood-chemical/ingredient (for lack of a better term?) levels before and after PK. Also, you've looked at research of the Soviets during their experiments with PK etc, i think?<br />
                  So.. have you found there to be any significant hormonal changes in the blood? -And do nicotine and alcohol have any effect on the skill of someone doing PK?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>My research has been on blood-sugar. The Soviets investigated rather more thoroughly. There are significant changes in the chemical balance of the blood, yes.</p>

                  <p>From what I've read, nicotine has no noticeable short-term effect on PK. Alcohol in any appreciable amount tends to mess up PK attempts; most tested depressants do, so it isn't overly surprising. It is "from what I've read", though. It is not impossible that some results of drug-tests may have
                  been reported inaccurately, or simply that more than one variable was involved.</p>

                  <p>Can TK be performed in front of skeptics, by a TK practitioner that can succesfully spin the psi weel when in a room on his own?</p>

                  <p>I have heard this is not possible, personally i get put off when demonstrating my non-paranormal skills, but im still able to demonstrate them with a little focus.</p>

                  <p>I just started practicing TK regardless of wheather its real or not. Someones got to try, in my opinion, not enough people play with their mind enough, no wonder we only use a fraction of our brain power.</p>

                  <p>TK can be performed in front of skeptics, even in front of pseudo-skeptic debunker types. There is a certain amount of "performance anxiety" that can interfere with your concentration, of course...same reason people sometimes forget easy stuff on exams.</p>

                  <p>All else being equal, levitation is probably the hardest, because you need to support the entire weight of the object. Anecdotal evidence also leads in the direction of "levitation is harder than sliding" based on the relative frequency of occurances. Of course, for statistical purposes, anecdotal
                  evidence poses a few problems.</p>

                  <p>The difficulty of sliding varies with the amount of friction between the object and whatever it is sliding on.</p>

                  <p>"Absorbing energy" from the flame would not be pyroPK, no. Presuming that you're not referring to the heat or light produced, but rather to a method of "gathering" psi-stuff, the "absorbing" is only a convention, not literal. If you are in the habit of using the elemental-magic approach, there is
                  no reason that you can't use the flame as your focal point. However, you will find it rather limiting: it's fine if you're playing with a flame that is already lit, but how will your sub-conscious react when you try to light a flame. "Hey! You always had me gather psi-stuff with the flame to do
                  this....there is no flame to gather from. What do you think you are doing _this_ time?"</p>
