PsiPog.net : Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidance
=================================================================
Newsletter #25, for February 10th, 2006

"A dream is not a dream if it comes true."
- Anonymous


Dear PsiPog Users,

From now on you will be recieving your newsletters from Yours
Truly, Oneta. I myself have been practicing for a while now, I
would have to shoot for 4-5 years if you want numbers. I
basically practice in most areas of psionics passively, except
for energy manipulation which I do much more often than the rest.
Other than that, I just poke around in the PsiPog chat.

PsiPog.net is having an online interview with Ed Dames! Now, I
realize most of you are thinking "Who is Ed Dames?". He is a
big name in the world of Remote Viewing, and was taught by Ingo
Swann. For more information (including two biographies, and a
cool video), check out the links on the calendar page:

http://www.psipog.net/calendar.php?view=1&day=1139688000

I suggest people take advantage of the event - it should be
really cool. It'll be in the main chat room at 3pm EST on
February 11th. (I'll be taking off the chat restrictions for it
so anyone can join, even if you aren't a member of PsiPog.net).

JoeT was the one who set all this up, so next time you see him,
tell him "Thanks!"

Now to dig into the mail bag....

=================================================================

Flyingmonkeyc reports:
"Hello,
First off, let me say just how 'psyched' I am to be here. I've
been trying to look for a site such as this. I tried the pinwheel
exercise and seemed to have it almost immediately! Of course,
some doubt came into my mind after, and I figured well maybe it
was my breathing. So I attempted it at eye level (so my breathing
wouldn't affect it), again, it spun as I wanted it to. So then I
think its my fingers making a breeze (I use my fingers to sort of
"control" the direction, makes it easier to visualize it in my
mind then act it out),so I tried it from farther away. Yep, got
it to spin from about 3 feet away (Though it was VERY difficult).
I was still skeptical.

My final test was put a cup over it. This would be the test of
tests for me, and would prove if I was actually controlling it.
So for about 30 min (I think, wasn't really paying attention) I
sat there, trying as hard as I could. Then it happened, it
wiggled. Then it started to turn. I kept it up for what seemed a
minute, at a very sloooow pace. I was so excited that I couldn't
concentrate any longer.

Now I KNOW that PK is real. I can control it with the cup after
some serious concentration, and without the cup almost at will
(at a pace that sort of freaks me out a bit). I just want to say
thanks a lot for the information, as now all I can think of is
training.

And if I may, is it possible to actually lift the paper off the
pin (well, I use a screw). I mean, obviously it will take time
if it is possible, but I just want to know if it has ever been
done? And is it normal to feel very weak after a long session
(say an hour+)? And lastly, is the fact that I am heavily
involved in martial arts matter? Oh, and one more question (sorry
for all the questions ;p ), if I want to make a video, how do I
put it in the media section, I think with a couple more days, I
can spin the pinwheel under the cup as fast as it goes without
the cup! Thanks again!"

My Comments: Awesome job on progress so far, Keep it up! For
levitating objects, it is possible in the same sense TK is
possible, as they both work on the same principle of you
affecting the object outside of normal means. People normally
notice fatigue after an hour or two, so I would say this is
normal. As for being involved in martial arts, being physically
fit couldn't hurt anything.

Metalicor exclaims:
"Hi, I think your site is fantastic and inspirational. I started
to try out body experiences for sometime now and for every
successful OBE I can't fall back a sleep. I don't know if it is
from shock or what but this really is a cool thing, and I would
love to hear ideas to continue my experience with OBEs. I also
practice aerokinesis, but sometimes I'm afraid to attempt because
every time I practice there is a storm either the next day or
right after i finish my training is this coincidence or could
this be possible."

My comments: Sounds like you may just be getting an added benefit
of the alternate state of consciousness OBE's offer, and resting
while in OBE as if you were napping, or it could be as you
mentioned and be your excitement preventing you from sleep. As
for the other, it is rare that we affect external forces as great
as that by accident, so to stay on the safe side, it is probably
coincidence.

=================================================================

SoreasKeyblade wonders:
"Hey! About a week ago after I read the articles about obe's I
did not try it and didn't give it a thought, but when I was
asleep I felt like I was awake and looking at my bed. The thing
is I couldn't move or even budge the only thing I felt moving was
my leg but it was not moving! Is this an OBE?"

My comments: This sounds like a brief case of Sleep Paralysis,
which normally results in a restriction of body movements while
being able to view your surroundings, which are sometimes
hallucinated, due to still being confined to a partial sleep
state. But this isn't a bad thing, as I had my first OBE from
Sleep Paralysis. Quite possibly it could have simply been a
dream also.

=================================================================

Scott from a previous letter writes:
"My friends and I were in a circle watching me move peppermint
sticks. I was doing it successfully taking only 15 seconds on
each until I tried to move one but instead 2 other candy canes
moved. How did this happen?"

Matt responds:
"I remember this happening before, when watching a PsiPog
member's web cam, they had 3 or so, and were focusing on the
middle one to move. Every now and then, the other two 'bumped' a
bit. My theory: Nobody's perfect, the directionality of the psi
he was using wavered from its original path, and instead of
moving the one he wanted to, it moved the other ones."

My comments: Its not uncommon for your intention to slip into
objects of similar shape/form when trying to do Telekinesis,
after all what decides that you wanna move this object and not
its exact look a-like next to it. Its left up to the clarity of
the intentions you put into moving the object.

=================================================================

Travis Rae notes:
"I recently read your tk thoughts, techs, and tips article and
had a very interesting experience afterwards. A few days later,
I had a dream where a friend was able to levitate a stack of
plates. They were normal, ceramic plates, but he continued to say
they were paper plates. I think that because of this, it could be
possible to make TK easier by tricking your subconscious that the
object is lighter than it actually is. I have yet to try it, but
you're welcome to give it a shot."

My comments: While this is one way of overcoming your doubt of
being able to pick up a stack of heavy ceramic plates by making
the concept of them being lighter, it also takes away from the
overall idea of what you are trying to achieve. I.e: Move ceramic
plates with the concept of what it would take to move paper
plates. Should this help you out in the short run, it becomes
troublesome in the long run, when you run out of objects with
lighter counterparts to imagine.

Jason lum shares:
"A couple days ago in my gym class, we were playing floor hockey,
and I was on the field. I decided to try something, and I
imagined my body in my mind,and having red particles,
representing heat, flowing from the center of my body outward,
and having blue particles, representing cold, flowing towards my
body from the outside. I did this for a while, and then after my
turn was done went to the bleachers while someone subbed for me.
I continued to do the activity in my mind, and I actually started
to get cold. This is the first time ive really done anything
temperature related,and the first time ive really had results
from any psi activities. Just thought I'd share it."

My comments: Thanks for sharing the nice visualization technique,
hope it works for others as well as you.

=================================================================

Joe Cool Guy asks:
"I have a friend who is interested in learning about psi. He
likes things structured, however, so he asked me what order he
should learn things in, and to help him build what I guess could
be called a psychic training regimen. If it works for your body,
it should for your mind, too, right? The progression I think I
will use for teaching him is: basic energy manipulation, psi
balls, tactile visualization, psi balls again (using tactile
visualization), and then let him go from there. But I was
wondering, would it be better to do it my way, or to teach
visualization first, and then go on to learning energy
manipulation? As for this training regimen, I am fairly lost. I
was thinking 30 minutes a day, with some kind of warm-up and
cool-down. Anyone have any suggestions or ideas?"

My comments: As for Tactile Visualization or Energy Manipulation
first, I think it would be best to practice them at the same
time, since they are incorporated into the same practices, it
would not be anything out of the normal. Also, Tactile
Visualization is nothing more than a more defined form of
visualization.

=================================================================

Zero054 theorizes:
"I have a small theory on TK for after you learn how to use it,
It goes something like this: When using telekinesis you use your
mind to move maybe say a Psiwheel on a tack. Well the more you
use it the stronger your mind gets. Like doing push ups you work
out your biceps and other arm muscles. I feel using Telekinesis
works the same. You do it over and over and over till you get
stronger at it and then you are able to move it faster and
better. Then you are able to move onto other objets say a pencil
or pen."

My comments: As it stands the more people practice the more used
to moving the object they get and the easier they recreate the
patterns next time. Whether this is because it removes more and
more doubt that person had stored away and whether it actually
involves how far they advance is up to that person. I don't
believe removing all doubt is key, just don't let it stand in the
way of your mindset while practicing.

=================================================================

Callum Harber comments:
"Hello, ever since I was really little I knew I was gifted, lots
of things have happened to me that I can't explain. I was
experimenting ways to absorb energy, and I thought I would try
seeing if I could get some out of a crystal ball I got once. I
put my hands on it and felt the energy flow, but then it got
really hot and my hands felt like they were burning so I had to
let go, is this normal?"

My Comments: Without knowing at what mindset you set out to
achieve your goal, it is hard to assume why you received the
results you did. Overall, it is possible it is just and
oversensitivity to energy at the point in time.

=================================================================

Azric warns:
"This is in response to what espman wrote. I have attempted
putting stressed emotions into psi balls before. I believe you
should be careful when doing so, because if, say, you put the
wrong emotion in them, or other little variables, it will make
your stomach turn, & make you feel a little sick."

My comments: Thanks for the warning, as we all know psi balls can
be used as a medium for emotions, which means they will radiate
the same feelings as programmed with. Which is why we should be
careful what we program them with.
