                  <p>Pendling is nothing more or less than a way to amplify the signal from your subconscious to your conscious mind, making it easier to understand. The accuracy of Pendling in the psionic context (usually using either Precognition or Clairvoyance) depends entirely on the operator's skill at
                  Precognition, Clairvoyance or whatever. To gauge your own accuracy, keep records of your results, and the accuracy thereof. Basic statistical analysis will give you an evaluation of your accuracy. Another, quicker, test, is to write a hundred or so questions on index cards, one question per card.
                  Choose questions to which you know the answers, or to which you will be able to find the answers relatively easily. (For Precog, try the Animal/Vegetable/Mineral thing at p-i-a.com) Shuffle the cards, and draw them, one at a time, face down, and pendle the answer. Check your results, and calculate
                  your score.</p>

                  <p>Before I got into psionics I actually went through a short period experimenting with self-hypnosis stuff... It's pretty wild, though I never really thought I hit the state everyone described. As far as it's relation to psionics... I mean, I am not a scientist, and to be honest I really don't know.
                  I'm sure it has SOME relation of some sort, you are messing with states of consciousness, which tends to be related to psionics. But other than that, I can't really for a solid opinion on the matter. Perhaps the other mods have more information than I do on the subject...</p>

                  <p>Do (I) think hypnosis is a form of psionics? No, not the usual sorts of hypnosis, at any rate. Something very like hyposis can be induced telepathically, and this effect is used in some kinds of telepathy "trials", for research purposes. Also, some psionic effects have been reported as being more
                  common and/or more easily controlled while in hypnotic trance. Regular "hypnosis expert" people have conniptions when asked about whether hypnosis is some kind of "black magic" or mind control...but many of them deny that hypnosis can be used without the consent of the subject, and this is a false
                  belief</p>

                  <p>It's very common to forget one's dreams soon after waking. If, later, you get "this strange remembering feeling" from experiencing something you dreamed about, that's "deja vu", in one of its apparently numerous forms.</p>

                  <p>I am unsure about AP, but you can alter the physical world in an Out of Body Experience. The case I'm reminded of first is from Robert Monroe's book, <i>Journeys Out of the Body</i>. He pinched a friend while OBEing to get her attention. She reacted to the pinch, and was surprised. He later found
                  out that she had a large bruise in that area that appeared (supposeably, from the pinch).</p>

                  <p>Also, I believe Robert Peterson (robertpeterson.org) has reported affecting the physical world while OBEing, only to return to his body and find that nothing had changed.</p>

                  <p>When you have an OBE, you won't wonder if it was an OBE or not. It feels 100% real. And by 100%, I don't mean dream-like-wishy-washy. I mean 100%. I have fallen out of body while in my bed and thought I actually physically fell out of bed a number of times.</p>

                  <p>So, if it felt like a dream, then it wasn't an OBE. If you woke up and crapped your pants in awe, then it was an OBE <img src="wink.gif"

                  <p>Are what is the difference between Astral Projection, OBE's, and remote presence? Can they be controlled consciously, or do they just happen unwillingly?</p>
               </div>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It's hard to give a definite answer to this, mainly because the terms are what you define them to be, and a lot of people have used the terms for different things. For example, a lot of people think Astral Projection (AP) and Out of Body Experiences (OBEs) are the same. Other people believe that
                  you can AP while OBEing, and you can AP without OBEing. Other people believe that AP is a type of OBE, and even others believe that OBEs are a type of AP. It's crazy.</p>

                  <p>Basically, I've seen the following trend:</p>

                  <p>AP - you perceive your conscious mind outside of your body, and the world around you is very strange (like you are flying around, and demon fish attack you).</p>

                  <p>OBE - you perceive your conscious mind outside of your body, and the world around you is the same as this world (like you stand up, and get out of your bed, and fly through you bedroom window).</p>

                  <p>Remote Presence (RP) - (please note I have never done this) - seems to be an OBE but with Bi-Location mixed in with it. This means that you perceive part of your conscious mind outside of your body, and you perceive part of your conscious mind still in your body. If you have your physical eyes
                  open, you see both locations (as I have heard it described).</p>

                  <p>They all can be controlled, and I believe that all of them can happen spontaneously too (not sure about RP though).</p>
