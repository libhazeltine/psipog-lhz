   [20:05] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I'm going to begin with some introductions. First, myself. My name is annie. I have been described by the lovely peebrain as being a valley girl without the ditz. I don't know about that, but I'm definitely not like anyone else you know.<br />
   [20:05] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> My psi career began as a toddler, though we didn't call it psi then. My family still does not subscribe to the verbiage I have chosen to use for these skills as an adult. I have two brothers and two parents. All of us but one brother can manipulate psi in some manner or another.
   That's ok though, we don't like him anyway. My father is what psipog would categorize as a telepath and my mother is what psipog would categorize as an empath/telepath.<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> However, I'm fair game. I was poltergeisting from the time I was 3, so says my mother. I keep reminding her that at least it wasn't during the terrible twos, but she doesn't appear comforted. It was always small stuff: toys, mostly. Then at puberty it moved on to electronics.<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This caused much tension between my father and I the day he bought a brand spanking new surround sound flat screen giant TV. It only made it through one menstrual cycle. Since then, I have been the target of an occasional combat related stalking or attack. My experience is personal
   to me, and probably won't be helpful for every single one of you. But I like to think I'm qualified enough to help a few, just from life experience<br />
   [20:06] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> So that's that. Let's move on to the next introduction. A brief introduction to shielding.<br />
   [20:07] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The interactions of every day can be overwhelming. Visits to the Department of Motor Vehicles can bring even a mediocre empath to his knees. Same with a crowded mall during the holidays.<br />
   [20:07] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Any time you're dealing with the public, you're dealing with flying emotions, unintended pinging or nagging, and general malicious folk -- among other things. Shielding is your defense against this.<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> There are all kinds of shields. The ones we will be discussing today are the ones I know how to make. These include:<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Bubble Shield<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Mirror/Reflective Shield<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Marshmallow Shield<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Cloaking<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Force Bubbles<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - Redirect Shield<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> - As well as some general programming tips for anything your strange teenaged minds can think up<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The purpose of shielding is obviously a defensive mechanism. It serves to either block or filter incoming or outgoing energy/emotion/influence. Sometimes it filters both. If you're going to be engaging in psionics skills, shielding is damned near essential.<br />
   [20:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Do I have any questions on the material covered so far?<br />
   [20:08] &lt;Confuzed&gt; Did you break your dads tv?<br />
   [20:08] &lt;abnormal989&gt; can nons unintentionally ping you?<br />
   [20:09] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> please no yes/no, just spit out the questions<br />
   [20:09] &lt;Strata&gt; these are questions she just answered<br />
   [20:09] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Confuzed: yes, i broke his tv and his stereo system<br />
   [20:09] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; does an empath unitentionally feell peoples emotions<br />
   [20:09] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> abnormal: yes<br />
   [20:09] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> anyone else?<br />
   [20:09] &lt;Savant&gt; What exactly is a ping, and can non psions ping?<br />
   [20:09] &lt;Lance&gt; are any of these attacks from people at psipog?<br />
   [20:09] &lt;tim93&gt; im a weak empath, do shields help feelings<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> let's get this straight.<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> sean and i are the only ones answering questions.<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> let's catch up.<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Savant: please read the telepathy manual or Rainsong's ramblings on pings<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Lance: i can't speak for anyone else at psipog<br />
   [20:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> tim: yes<br />
   [20:11] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> any other questions, before we continue<br />
   [20:11] &lt;Raven21&gt; is a ping continuous or like a computer pings another computer (i dont think this is answered in thte articles)?<br />
   [20:11] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; will this be posted on psipog.net<br />
   [20:11] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> yes, the log it will be posted on PsiPog.net<br />
   [20:11] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Raven: it can be. or it can just be a tap.<br />
   [20:11] &lt;WindShade&gt; Is it possible that females make better empaths than males?<br />
   [20:11] &lt;hyperion2&gt; Can shields be visible?<br />
   [20:11] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> hyperion: yes<br />
   [20:12] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> WindShade: as far as I know, gender has nothing to do with it<br />
   [20:12] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Moving on.<br />
   [20:12] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Before we get into the specific programming of different sorts of shields, let's cover the very basics of how to create a psionics shield around yourself. Clearly think about your shield's intent. What is it going to do? Why do you need the shield? Is this a temporary shield that
   needs to dissipate before a certain time, or a more permanent one that will just require maintenance?<br />
   [20:13] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> There are a couple different visualizations people use in the creation of a shield. The basic idea is to draw up plenty of energy, let it surround or even "swirl" around you. Use whatever visualization you're comfortable with. Some people visualize waterfalls. Some visualize
   flames. Others just make a really big psiball and step into it like an oversized winter coat. I am not a visualization person, if you haven't already noticed, so I have trouble trying to think of good ones for other people. Shell the shield like you would any other construct, and after you've added plenty of psi,
   just let it go.<br />
   [20:13] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> (emphasis on plenty)<br />
   [20:13] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The first specific one I'm going to discuss is a shield that's been coined The Bubble Shield. Personally, I find this shield a bit useless in and of itself, but if you tweak it a little it can be a lot more fun and a lot less useless. This is the finger-painting of shielding, too,
   so this should be an easy success.<br />
   [20:14] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> A bubble shield is created around your body. It's intent is just your basic filter. No random emotions, thought patterns, or every day telepathic "noise". Programming this while you're visualizing your shield being created is important. Remember what I said about intent. Don't just
   start making a shield and go "hmm, what am I going to do with this shield today. Ho hum. What to do what to do." Have a mission statement before you even begin draw<br />
   [20:14] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The next step in shielding is The Mirror Shield. If you're going to use this shield in combination of layers, please make sure this is your outer layer. I really shouldn't have to explain why. This is created initially in the same manner as The Bubble Shield. (You should start
   noticing a theme here, soon.) You are going to gather up plenty of psi. Do your chosen visualization. With this one, I'm going to take the example of "stepping into" a construct that's been programmed to reflect.<br />
   [20:15] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> What is it you're trying to block? Watch it bounce off of this construct. What is symbolic to you of the emotions/thoughts/other constructs/etc. that you're trying to block? I like to teach dirt or mud or things that are easily rejected by the subconscious.<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Make it small. Make it simple. Overdoing it is only going to screw up your programming, so don't be a showoff.<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> At this point you should have a pretty decent sized psiball with programming set to strongly reflect. Add more psi. Add more. Then add more. Now either literally or mentally step into your construct. I'd go with literally, since we're going all out anyway.<br />
   [20:16] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Let's take 5 to play around with this shield or ask your questions or use the restroom or whatever. Please keep your questions to only what I have covered so far.<br />
   [20:17] &lt;WindShade&gt; Can you give any examples of things that mirror shields are used to reflect?<br />
   [20:17] &lt;Savant&gt; How do I test my shield?<br />
   [20:17] &lt;Droshi&gt; should you program the shield while you are adding psi, or should you form the complete construct, and then program it?<br />
   [20:17] &lt;_Triocalas|TP&gt; so basically annie we start the shield small and increase the size?<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Droshi: you can try both, but personally I program it while adding the psi - why do two steps when you can do just one big one? ;-)<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Droshi: the important point though is to have everything figured out before you even move the psi around<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> WindShade: sure. constructs. unwanted empathy. unwanted everyday telepathic noise. mosquitoes.<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Savant: have someone test it for you. We'll get to that.<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Droshi: the former<br />
   [20:18] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Triocalas: that is one way that i'm teaching<br />
   [20:19] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> does anyone who is participating in the shield creation have any specific questions about theirs?<br />
   [20:20] &lt;Pixie1&gt; ive read that shields can instead of blocking out incoming telepathic signals, they can enhance them and make them easier to pick up. like when youre not a natural telepath and use a shield to aid your training, is that true?<br />
   [20:20] &lt;Metsruler2189&gt; is it possible to make it around yourself<br />
   [20:20] &lt;Droshi&gt; when im creating constructs as big as a shield they tend to collapse...is there something i can do to prevent that?<br />
   [20:20] &lt;WindShade&gt; When programing a shield to block things such as mosquitos, do you visualize the mosquito wanting to move from the area, or bouncing off? Eh?<br />
   [20:20] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Pixie: I suppose you can program some kind of beacon. Never tried it, myself, though.<br />
   [20:20] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Mets: yes, that's the point<br />
   [20:21] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Droshi: you need to increase the amount you add by about a million. Make it solid, from inside out.<br />
   [20:21] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Pixie: if you do try that, be careful, in all the cases I've heard of people programming those types of shields, the shields work TOO good ;-)<br />
   [20:22] &lt;hyperion2&gt; I feel drained after peebs warm up, is there a way to gather more psi quickly? and also, If you visualize your shield to reflect light, should you be able to see in front of you?<br />
   [20:22] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> drink some water or some orange juice. if you're too drained, just listen and sit this one out for now. also, i haven't gotten to reflecting yet. so when i say "please keep your questions to what we've covered so far" what i mean is please keep your questions to what we've covered
   so far.<br />
   [20:23] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Moving on, again.<br />
   [20:23] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The next shield we're going to cover is one of my favorites to teach. It's The Marshmallow Shield. The name of this shield makes me think of the end of Ghostbusters. Not the exploding part, the part just before that.<br />
   [20:23] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> In any case, the purpose is to absorb and diffuse incoming attacks. It's not a shield I keep up 24/7, only because it makes me very claustrophobic and hot. I really don't see a reason to keep it up 24/7 unless you're just super paranoid about the psychic conspiracy coming to get
   your ass. (And we will.)<br />
   [20:23] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Just kidding, mostly. As serious a matter as combat is, this shield is fun. And you should have fun making it. The less stressed you get about creating this shield, the better and more clear your defense.<br />
   [20:24] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This is another matter of intent and programming. Your mission statement should be something along the lines of "This shield will absorb incoming attacks and diffuse them before they ever reach my body. This shield will 'stick around' (har har) until I manually get rid of
   it."<br />
   [20:24] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Then make it happen. The Marshmallow Shield incites the most response from the imagination, so I'm not going to guide you through this one. Take a few minutes. Gather and program psi. Make it happen.<br />
   [20:25] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> If you have questions at this point, please PM them to Mannen or Strata.<br />
   [20:26] &lt;Strata&gt; Sirius: is it possible to make it to where it absorbs them then increases the stregnth(SP?) of the shield?<br />
   [20:26] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> sure!<br />
   [20:26] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> it's a matter of tweaking the programming to do so.<br />
   [20:27] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> so while you're creating and programming, do so with the intent or "mission statement" as we've called it today of absorbing and using to fuel the current shield<br />
   [20:27] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> OR you can do things like save the construct for later use. but i won't get too much into that, as it is toeing the combat line more than i'd like to.<br />
   [20:28] &lt;Strata&gt; jaci: Is visulisation the best way to take down a shield without a time limit built in<br />
   [20:29] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> i don't know if there is a "best" way. visualization works. funner yet, is making a construct to blow it to smithereens. or just shake it off like you would a link.<br />
   [20:29] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> like a wet dog, you know?<br />
   [20:29] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> personally, I use "kill codes"... if I tell the sheild to die, it dies quickly<br />
   [20:29] &lt;Strata&gt; Droshi: for all of the shields is part of the programming implied to be "hold together"<br />
   [20:29] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> That also works.<br />
   [20:30] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> if i understand your question right, droshi, yes. there should be a shelling or hold together type programming in there.<br />
   [20:30] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Moving on. Strata, Mannen, hold your questions please.<br />
   [20:30] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Next is the Cloaking or Hedge Shield. I dig this one a lot, because nothing says "leave me the hell alone" like not being able to be found or targeted. You can also use cloaking in combination with masking if you're under psychic attack.<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This one is a bit more complicated than the others, as a little bit of telepathy is involved. And before the more experienced psions sneeze at that, just listen.<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> There are actually people who don't know what their psi signature feels like. And when you try to explain it, they look at you like you're stepping off of a flying saucer. (I know, crazy, but it's true.) So I will rephrase to avoid the sneezing.<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> You must be at least good enough with telepathy to know your own signature. It is also helpful if you have at least some semblance of competence in telepathic suggestion.<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This really isn't the simplest of shields, now that I think about it. But at least we're into the useful stuff. When gathering and programming the psi, you're not just dealing with purposes and mission statements anymore.<br />
   [20:31] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This is just more advanced programming. You're answering more questions and having to think of several things at once. Project yourself into this construct as what you want to be seen.<br />
   [20:32] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> . If you want to not be seen, project invisible, blank, nothing, and so on. You can use this to be underestimated, over appreciated, liked; you can project confidence, or arrogance, or sensitivity, or anything you want to project. (If you have a job in sales, these projections are
   almost a must.)<br />
   [20:32] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> So we're creating this construct to be used as a shield. I'm going to use the example of projecting "Don't notice me. I am a hedge. I am a hedge. Don't notice me."<br />
   [20:32] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> We're creating a shield in the normal manner. Gather, swirl around, and then without hesitation program EXACTLY what you want.<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> For my example, I would immediately start projecting things like boring, and non-threatening, as well as don't-even-bother-noticing-this-one. I would also still be programming the construct as to size, quantity of psi, and time to live.<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Sometimes I'm asked pretty interesting questions like, "annie, if I use your hedge shield and I walk up and slap someone, would they notice?" The answer is an unequivocal yes. If you truly think you're that "invisible" you might need to seek psychiatric council.<br />
   [20:33] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This "invisibility shield" is not actually for being invisible. You can do fun things like sneak up on people, but slapping them or dancing around naked with your hair on fire will more than likely get their attention -- shield or no shield.<br />
   [20:34] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> It's most often used to lay low while undergoing psychic attack. If you decide it's a good idea to try this shield while slapping your sister, you deserve the dunking of your head in the toilet that is to follow.<br />
   [20:34] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I wish I could spell this shield out a little more for you, and perhaps if I were a more articulate person I could. But this is the best I can give you. You probably won't get it the first time, but it's certainly one I recommend putting some effort into practicing.<br />
   [20:34] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Do I have any questions on the material covered so far?<br />
   [20:34] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Please PM them to Strata<br />
   [20:35] &lt;Strata&gt; Droshi: would it be possible to force a hallucination so that you actually were "invisible"..on one or more minds at once<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> good question<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> beats me ;-)<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> i don't understand that question.<br />
   [20:35] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> on one or more minds at once?<br />
   [20:36] &lt;Droshi&gt; either just to one person's mind or say to an entire crowd<br />
   [20:36] &lt;Droshi&gt; when i mean hallucination just influencing what light their eye percieves<br />
   [20:36] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> oh!<br />
   [20:36] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: (I'm not sure if this is relevant yet) If you can program a shield to reflect light, can you program it to reflect the images behind what's being shielded? In a sense, literally make something appear invisible?<br />
   [20:36] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade: that would require you to reflect light, which is impossible<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> you're just asking if the projection can be narrowed to one person or broadened to a crowd?<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> sure. the one person thing is a little more nitpicky in the programming. but sure.<br />
   [20:37] &lt;Strata&gt; abnormal989: why is reflecting light impossible<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> read a physics book<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> well, maybe not techically impossible, but it is much easier to just use telepathic projection<br />
   [20:37] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> we barely have bending light down<br />
   [20:38] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> is that all for questions?<br />
   [20:38] &lt;Strata&gt; not at all<br />
   [20:38] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> (i.e., if you have the skill to bend/reflect light, you can do telepathic projection very easily)<br />
   [20:38] &lt;Strata&gt; Savant: Sir Strata. Instead of creating the effect of being invisible to psionic attackers, could one conceivably create a feeling of power, to intimidate the attacker, similar to animals?<br />
   [20:39] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> yes, savant. we haven't gotten there yet.<br />
   [20:39] &lt;Strata&gt; Client: If you're a man and you want people to think you're a girl but don't want to go through all the operations, could a cloak shield hide your...fireman?<br />
   [20:39] &lt;Strata&gt; Telekinex_Man: You can reflect light off a mirror, why could you just program it to reflect light 'like a mirror'?<br />
   [20:40] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> wait yes we have. under the hedge part.<br />
   [20:40] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Telekinex: there is a lot of "maybe this" or "maybe that" - if you can make something that can mimick a mirror out of psi, then you wouldn't be in this seminar<br />
   [20:40] &lt;Strata&gt; Lance: If someone is sending a constuct using your sig and your using a cloak shield, how does the shield go about hiding from the incoming construct?<br />
   [20:40] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Client: i am drawing a blank. i've never tried to hide my penis before.<br />
   [20:41] &lt;Strata&gt; Psi-Sam: is it possible to put a shield around someones eyes and programm it to let them not see you?<br />
   [20:41] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Psi-Sam - probably not... I've never tried it, but like I mentioned before, if your intention is to not be seen, telepathic projection is your best bet<br />
   [20:41] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Lance: that's more a matter of masking. You can mask your sig while you're cloaking.<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> And if someone is using your sig to throw constructs at other people, I suggest a good ass whooping.<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> all this bending light stuff is overkill, and probably impossible<br />
   [20:42] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: Can you shield other people? If someone's being annoying, can you take the step of ignoring someone a little farther to make them unnoticable?<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I agree with peebrain on that.<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> yes WindShade you can shield other people<br />
   [20:42] &lt;Strata&gt; Yumper: Is it possible to make a shield that makes people think you are someone else?<br />
   [20:42] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Yumper: as in, in person?<br />
   [20:42] &lt;Yumper&gt; yeah<br />
   [20:43] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> it's possible i suppose. though i don't know this from personal experience. i think i'd be madonna, if you could though.<br />
   [20:43] &lt;Mannen&gt; If a shield gets damaged, can it be like a "hole" in just one spot, or would the whole shield get weaker evenly?<br />
   [20:43] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> psionically though, i do it all the time.<br />
   [20:43] &lt;Strata&gt; twang_: could two people combine shielding upon someone else?<br />
   [20:44] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Mannen: it can just be a hole, but think of it as a crack in your windshield. it spreads eventually, fast or slow depending on the angle and force it was hit with<br />
   [20:44] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Mannen: depends on the shield, depends on the attack<br />
   [20:44] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> twang: yeah, but it would be stupid<br />
   [20:44] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: What stops others from killing your own shields since it's all dealing with energy anyways?<br />
   [20:45] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> it comes down to skill and programming. for example, if you tried to kill mine, you'd be in for quite a surprise.<br />
   [20:45] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> OK.<br />
   [20:45] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> MOVING on. hold your questions<br />
   [20:46] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Cool. O.K. What's next again? Ooh, force bubbles. This one is terribly fun, and terribly cool. Force bubbles require an intermediate level of psychokinesis skill. So, what is a force bubble? Well, it's only the super duper coolest shield _ever_. But it's pretty advanced as far as
   shielding goes, and once again requires about an intermediate level of competency with psychokinesis.<br />
   [20:47] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> The way that peebrain visualizes this is to visualize himself building up a little fort around him. He lays down, brick by brick, until there is a wall around, under, and atop of him. He also then visualizes a bunch of arrows to relay the word "force" and "that way" to his
   subconscious.<br />
   [20:47] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Other visualizations include just visualizing this as a giant negative end of the magnet. Peebrain tends to think more scientifically than I do, so even if you're dumb like me you can visualize a bigass magnet. Right?<br />
   [20:47] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> My suggestion, if you want me to be honest, is to work with this on a smaller psiball-esque level before you begin turning it into a shield. Make a smaller construct, that can be used as a force bubble.<br />
   [20:47] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> It's cool what you can do with these as well. A word from personal experience though, don't set your force bubble balls down. They roll. And they knock things off counters. Glass things. Yeah.<br />
   [20:48] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This is a skill that comes with practice. I don't expect any of you to have force bubbles down tonight. But I expect you to think it's cool enough to start incorporating into your practice.<br />
   [20:48] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I'm sure we have plenty of questions on force bubbles. I'll give you about 5 minutes to ask.<br />
   [20:48] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Ask Strata or Mannen, that is.<br />
   [20:48] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> and one at a time from you two, please<br />
   [20:49] &lt;Strata&gt; abnormal989: how is PK incorporated into this?<br />
   [20:49] &lt;Strata&gt; Droshi: when i visualize shields im usually sitting in a chair...since this shield can move physical objects, would it be bad to create it partially splitting an object?<br />
   [20:49] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: Can you shield single parts of your body? For example: can you make a force shield around your hand only?<br />
   [20:49] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> one. at. a. time.<br />
   [20:50] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> abnormal: it's a shield that actually moves things it comes in contact with. how is pk NOT incorporated into it?<br />
   [20:50] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade: yes, you can even stick these sheild in remote locations - Rainsong suggested using them to mess around in billiard games<br />
   [20:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> abnormal: if you're asking how to actually incorporate the PK into it, use the visualization suggestions that annie outlined above (arrows for forces, or negative magnet poles)<br />
   [20:51] &lt;Mannen&gt; Psi-Sam: For force-bubbles do i visualize like spikes coming out a psiball or it around me?<br />
   [20:51] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Droshi: i am of the opinion that you can be hanging upside down from a tree, if you damn well please. i don't know that you'll make any difference or break your chair.<br />
   [20:51] &lt;Strata&gt; Faragorn: can i use a force construct as protection from STD's?<br />
   [20:51] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> unless you're fat, of course.<br />
   [20:51] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Faragorn: that's idiotic<br />
   [20:51] &lt;Strata&gt; Raven21: Is the strength of the force bubble proportional to your tk ability, i.e. if you can push a pencil, your force bubble would do the same or can it be more powerful?<br />
   [20:52] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> PsiSam: visualize what you want. it's a force that pushes things away<br />
   [20:52] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Faragorn: i have a feeling your abstinence is what's keeping you from getting STDs, not your force bubbles.<br />
   [20:52] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Raven21: yes, the shield is dependant on your PK ability... but even if you can't do PK, you can get some cool results that aren't quite force-bubbles, but weird acting contructs<br />
   [20:52] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Raven: it's related in an indirect way, it's not concrete like your example<br />
   [20:53] &lt;Strata&gt; Savant: What use do force bubbles have in shields, in relations to psi? I could see it keeping mosqiutoes away, or protecting you from various physical things...<br />
   [20:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Savant: Rainsong used one to stop her car from getting in a wreck<br />
   [20:53] &lt;Strata&gt; Pixie1: force bubbles knocks things away from them, is it good to have a shield that hinder physical contact with things?<br />
   [20:53] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> well, it got in a wreck, she just didn't die :-P<br />
   [20:53] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Savant: you can come up with all kinds of uses. Rain used it to save her life. I use it for things more superficial, like moving dinner plate away.<br />
   [20:54] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> At this point I'd like to cover briefly some of the additional programming you can add to any shield. We've discussed reflecting in terms of mirrors and force bubbles. We've discussed sticky and absorbing marshmallow shields. We've discussed cloaking and masking to a certain
   degree.<br />
   [20:55] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Now I'd like to talk about redirecting. This is a cool trick, when under attack. PsiPog doesn't condone the harming of others in any way shape or form. However, we don't expect you to be martyrs either.<br />
   [20:55] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> If it comes down to you or them, the answer is simple. Has your family ever gone on holiday and had their calls forwarded? Well, that's basically what redirecting is. Any attack you're directing towards me gets forwarded on to someone else.<br />
   [20:55] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Hell, or some THING else if you're one of those pacifist hippies. I used to redirect to a house plant fern thingy once. My mother couldn't figure out why it kept dying under perfect planting conditions. C'est la vie, I suppose.<br />
   [20:55] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> This is another matter of programming. Get your sig. Know who or what you're redirecting towards, and program this during the creation of your shield. Then practice many times.<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I'd also like to talk about filtering. For the most part, I'm pretty much a bitch who doesn't want to deal with anyone. But there are a limited number of people who I actually -want- to receive intentional thoughts or pings or the like from.<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> When I create my heavy duty shields, it's a matter of commanding/manipulating to block ALL. EXCEPT these particular sigs. Again, this is a matter of practice and getting comfortable with it.<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Another variation of this is to create a filter that takes each sig as they try to come through, decide if you're going to allow the traffic or not, and proceed accordingly. This is some pretty complicated programming, when attempting to put into words.<br />
   [20:56] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Think of it as your very own secretarial shield. "Thank you for contacting annie's shield, can you hold please?" while your shield and subconscious work together to decipher things like friend/foe, wanted/unwanted traffic, and just plain do you feel like dealing with incoming crap
   right now.<br />
   [20:57] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> It's not as complicated as I make it sound, so please at least give it a good effort. You could very well surprise yourself.<br />
   [20:57] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> At this time, I'd like to take some questions from the group before we end the seminar for the evening. This could take a significant amount of time, so please bear with me if your question isn't answered right away.<br />
   [20:57] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> send questions to Mannen or Strata, please<br />
   [20:58] &lt;Mannen&gt; Would it be possible to create an "inverse" force bubble? That is, one that would let things in, but not out.<br />
   [20:58] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> like a little tiny black hole?<br />
   [20:58] &lt;Mannen&gt; Yes.<br />
   [20:58] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> i haven't. doesn't mean it is impossible, though.<br />
   [20:58] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> I've never tried it, give it a go and see what happens<br />
   [20:58] &lt;Strata&gt; Droshi: what would be the point of redirecting if you could simply reflect an attack back to the person who sent it?<br />
   [20:59] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Droshi: to spice up life, or to kill two birds with one stone<br />
   [20:59] &lt;Mannen&gt; Would a force bubble have a mass..? Would it weigh anything?<br />
   [20:59] &lt;Strata&gt; Lance: you (annie) said a force bubble would roll around and move things if you let it down. Does that mean force bubbles have telekinetic properties? If so, do they have to or can you make one that only affects psi?<br />
   [20:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Droshi: why have one way to stop an attack, when you can have two ways?<br />
   [20:59] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Mannen: yes, the more solid bubbles have mass, and Rainsong actually described shards of one in her force bubble article I believe<br />
   [20:59] &lt;Mannen&gt; _Triocalas|TP: how much force can a force bubble exert?<br />
   [20:59] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> I've never owned a scale small enough to measure, Mannen. But my guess would be yes.<br />
   [21:00] &lt;Strata&gt; twang_: could mass-pinging/thoughts be possible? wouldnt this affect the way people behave? could we all have a "natural" instinct to shield ourselves at all times?<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Lance: i already said it has psychokinetic properties. That's what it is.<br />
   [21:00] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> twang: I don't understand the question<br />
   [21:00] &lt;Mannen&gt; Psi-Sam: Can i make a shield around like a rock and programmed it to lift up with the rock in it.will it work?<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Triocalas: a fair amount. if you want a number in pounds per square inch, i can't help you<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> twang: that has nothing to do with this seminar<br />
   [21:01] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: Can you create a force bubble designed to hold something still?<br />
   [21:01] &lt;Mannen&gt; Sawyer_Hickory: Is there a big difference in what kind of shield you use if you program it the same way as another type?<br />
   [21:01] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade: once again, I'll resort to: "I've never tried it, but probably, so give it a shot"<br />
   [21:02] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> In my experience, when i make force bubbles, nothing stays still. but go for it.<br />
   [21:02] &lt;Strata&gt; Alkadual: How would you program the shield to allow certian psi sigs through? would you think of the psi sig or the persons name or face?<br />
   [21:02] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Sawyer: not really. the purpose and programming are the only signifigant factors really<br />
   [21:03] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Alkadual: me personally? i just think of their sig. as far as visualization goes, face is good. name is fine.<br />
   [21:03] &lt;Strata&gt; twang_: could a force bubble be programmed to serve multiple purposes in one go? or does it lose all its energy as soon as it hits one object?<br />
   [21:03] &lt;Mannen&gt; hyperion2: Is it possible to create a shield that would bring things in? such as a shield to gather energy? if so would the shield maitnance take more energy than you gather?<br />
   [21:03] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> twang: they can sustain<br />
   [21:03] * abnormal989 (pR2A9CC16B@vw-19876.comcast.net) has left #projection<br />
   [21:03] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> twang: depends on the skill, depends on the programming, depends on the purpose, etc...<br />
   [21:03] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> hyperion: yes it's possible. and the rest would depend on several things.<br />
   [21:04] &lt;Mannen&gt; _Triocalas|TP: Would going into altered states of consciosuness i.e. trances help increase power and speed of force bubble?<br />
   [21:04] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Trio: not to my knowledge. never hurts to try, if you're into the altered state game though<br />
   [21:04] &lt;Strata&gt; Lance: In a force bubble, is the force exerted at all times or only when theres an object to repel? If the force is always being exerted, wouldnt this wear you out pretty fast? Also, is the force exerted on the ground as well? With enough force<br />
   [21:05] &lt;Strata&gt; Lance: could you possibly levitate<br />
   [21:05] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> all times. it's not a matter of being worn out, it's a matter of programming.<br />
   [21:06] &lt;Strata&gt; Kingcob: If you are moderately skilled at both pk and force bubbles, which would be a more effective means of moving objects?<br />
   [21:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Lance: I'll reference Rainsong concerning levitation. She has 30 years experience and hasn't levitated. So, is it possible? beats me... Is it probable? no<br />
   [21:06] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> that is the only way i know to make the appearance of levitation, is by stepping on a force bubble. but i don't recommend this as when i tried it i fell and twisted my elbow.<br />
   [21:06] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> cool<br />
   [21:06] &lt;Strata&gt; WindShade: Can you create a force shield with a design that fits your form, instead of a clumsy bubble?<br />
   [21:06] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> King: keep up working on your pk. then you can do both.<br />
   [21:07] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> WindShade: you take the name very literally. make it a giant horseshoe if you want.<br />
   [21:07] &lt;Strata&gt; Yumper: Would it be possible to create a shield that makes people wander away from you? Like an anti-social shield?<br />
   [21:07] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> yes. the hedge shield. aka the leave me the hell alone shield.<br />
   [21:07] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> WindShade: concerning other shapes, a bubble is usually used because if you are attacked, and the attack bounces off a "form-fitting" shield, it could hit you again (like bouncing in between your legs)<br />
   [21:08] &lt;Strata&gt; Raven21: is a force bubble in the shape of a ball just a regular psiball with programming?<br />
   [21:08] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> we're running a bit over. are there more questions in queue?<br />
   [21:09] <b>&lt;peebrain&gt;</b> Raven: yes, it's a ball with force bubble programming...<br />
   [21:09] * peebrain confused by the question<br />
   [21:10] &lt;Strata&gt; no<br />
   [21:10] &lt;Mannen&gt; None here.<br />
   [21:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Raven: as i said, and sean clarified, it can be just a plain old psiball with the programming. it can be a full body armor shield. or it can be a giant horseshoe.<br />
   [21:10] <b>&lt;anniesocks&gt;</b> Thank you for your attendance. I hope to do more seminars in the near future. Also, if you'd like to stick around for a bit and test out each other's shields (in a non-combative way, please!) And for a little while, I will be available on a first come first serve basis to give a
   scan to those who think they've been successful but need affirmation. Good luck and happy shielding.</p>
