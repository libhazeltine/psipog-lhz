                  <p>Heh i noticed 2 thinngs... 1 - How come does it day Psipog is under construction? It has been around for about 5 years as far as i can remember. At the moment it seems as if it is completed. I'm just currious why it says that? 2 - It says it was last updated in May. but to be serious, Psipog gets
                  updated nearly every day does it not? Just two little things im currious about. ^^;;</p>

                  <p>For the links section, you say that if we have a good website that we should submit it. I have a few questions on this, firstly what constitutes good? Secondly, does it have to do with something mentioned on this site, or could it be on something that has no articles yet, or that doesn't exactly
                  fit the site (such as a majick, religious meditation, or other paranormal things). Thanks in advance.</p>

                  <p>Howdy,<br />
                  I am from Brazil and was planning to build a website like yours but in portuguese. Actually, we dont have any good website related to this subject. So, we'd like to translate your articles to our language and put on our website, keeping the authors name and showing advertisement to your website, and
                  links as well. What do you think about it? I woud like your permission for that since im not the owner of this articles.</p>

                  <p>I am Peebrain, the webmaster of PsiPog, but I don't OWN the articles on here. I personally only own the articles that I wrote (the ones that say "by Peebrain" <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"
                       height="12"
                       border="0"
                       alt="Smile"
                       class="smileyImg" />). My personal policy, about MY articles, is you can copy them if:</p>

                  <p>1. Proper credit is given (i.e., "this article was written by peebrain").</p>

                  <p>2. A link back to PsiPog.net somewhere.</p>

                  <p>3. None of the content is changed (i.e., you can't copy one paragraph, then add your own paragraph, then delete some of my sentences, and change them for yourself).</p>

                  <p>Now, if you are translating the articles, obviously that would violate my 3rd rule. But that's kind of the point of making the site, is to translate the articles, so we are kind of in a pickle. So... IF you promise to translate those articles as acurately as possible, then ok. If you are going to
                  do a half-assed job, then forget it.</p>

                  <p>These rules only apply to MY articles. You need to contact the authors of different articles if you want to use one of their articles. Otherwise, you do not have permission to use their article.</p>

                  <p>Hope that is somewhat clear <img src="blah.gif"
                       width="12"

                  <p>Well, i think that this website is awesome and everything. Except i wish that on the Q and A section you guys would atleast answer 4 questions a day. I mean sometimes you guys dont even answer one! I'm so glad you chose to answer my question in the kinesis section. But your answers dont even make
                  sense. If you could answer the questions a bit more specifically and more often, that would be better. And i guess this question is for all of the members on this site thanks.</p>

                  <p>You seem to overlook the fact that everyone here, including Peebrain, has a life outside the Internet. None of us are paid to tend this site. Some of the questions that get asked in the Q&amp;A simply don't get answered, for any number of reasons. For example, a few asked about how to do
                  teleportation. It doesn't matter how much a person believes in it, that belief still does not affect whether or not _we_ know how to do it. Some questions that _are_ answered, might not be what the querant was looking for, as apparently was the case with your very simple question about PK.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The logic is that empathy falls under... well... Empathy. Healing is manipulating something. Not perceiving. So someone looking for healing instructions might look in Manipulation-&gt;Other, and someone looking for things to do with Empathy will look in the Perception-&gt;Empathy category. Both
                  users should be directed to that article, so that's why it's in multiple categories. A lot of articles are in multiple categories, actually.</p>
