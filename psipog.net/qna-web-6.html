                  <p>I don't really think that's a good idea. For a couple reasons:</p>

                  <p>1. Some people who visit this website are just insane. We attract some weirdos out there.</p>

                  <p>2. A lot of people on PsiPog are under 18. IF I did do something like that, I would have to require people to be at least 18. And we all know that some young kids out there are going to lie just so they can participate.</p>

                  <p>3. Combine 1 and 2 together, and it's a very bad situation.</p>

                  <p>It appears that you have updated the profiles of the members, and have included age in your update. Although I know it would be easy to fake and mostly unreliable, I am curious if you plan to post the average age of a psipog user.<br />
                  Scewing this statistic are obvious things like that I have two usersnames (SunTzu, and SunTzuWarmaster), people can easily lie about their age, and will most likely to so if they are under 13.<br />
                  However, I am still interested in the average age of a use, since I have seen most of the birthdays have been people above 21 lately (who knows, they could have told you they were born in 1900, I know I do regularly).</p>

                  <p>PsiPog ran into a few legal bumps earlier where it would have been nice just to have SOME input. I really don't care if people lie in the forms - I do it all the time too. But, it's really not that big of a deal, and it could take care of legal shit in the future. I keep all information private,
                  but I also fall under United States law, which requires me to provide information under certain conditions. In the event earlier, more information was needed to help someone in a tough situation. It kind of made me mad that I had stopped asking for the minor information - it would have come in handy
                  at the time. But yes, lie in the forms, that's fine with me. It's really none of my business, unless you're under 13.</p>

                  <p>No, you can't, but thank you so much for asking. Some people don't ask, and it makes the current authors not want to write any more articles. The articles are copyright their respective authors, and any other PsiPog content that doesn't have an author is copyright to me.</p>

                  <p>As an author, I do allow people to copy MY articles (articles that are written by me, Peebrain). My personal requirements are:</p>

                  <p>1. You do not change anything (you can't translate the text, or edit a sentence, etc...)<br />
                  2. You give proper credit (you clearly mark that the article is written by Peebrain)<br />
                  3. You clearly link back to <a href="http://www.psipog.net"
                     target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net</a> somewhere on your website.</p>

                  <p>Those are the requirements for MY articles. Other articles, by different authors, have different policies. If you don't know their policy, then don't copy the material. The best way is to ask them (like you have here).</p>

                  <p>Copying a Q&amp;A post would require you to contact every author of the person you want to copy from. Copying anything else on PsiPog is illegal.</p>

                  <p>Hi Peebrain,<br />
                  I was wondering how you made the forms (like the Q&amp;A Submit form) so you could click "Ask Question", or "Submit", and it would send it to you. (I hope that made sense) I have sort of a request form in the making on my site, but I can't figure out how to send the form to me. Even dad, the master
                  computer programer, can't figure out what it would take. My server is AOL, so I can't use CGI, and I have know idea how to use PHP.<br />

                  <p>I use PHP and MySQL, which allow you to do all sorts of cool things. Actually, when people submit a question, it gets put on a page that only moderators can view. Then the moderators can pick and choose which question to answer, ignore, delete, etc... It's all done in PHP and MySQL. If you can't
                  run CGI or PHP, your best bet is either using something that is hosted somewhere else for free (like bravenet.com), or making the form e-mail you the information (which is kind of sloppy). Search around for tutorials on forms.</p>

                  <p>Hi peebrain,<br />
                  I was messing around with the PsiPog calender and found it only goes up to the year 2037. After that it says year 1969. Why's that?<br />

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>The calendar stores dates in Unix format. Which basically means it stores them in 32-bit unsigned numbers. The numbers count the seconds from January 1st, 1970. Using only 32-bits, this makes the 32-bit number fill up in 2037 or 2038 (I forget when exactly). So it counts up... and up and up...
                  hits 2037... counts up but overflows. Gets wrapped back around to 0, which is January 1st, 1970. Depending on your timezone it can be in December of 1969.</p>

                  <p>Hey have ever played a game where u can increase int. and it will give you more magic power. Well i was wondering if thats just in game or is it the higher your grades the better your chances are to getting alot better, and if you use energy to make psiballs and stuff is there a way to increase

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>Unfortunately "higher intelligence" and "higher grades" do not always go hand in hand. Those students who have to _work_ at getting those higher grades (and do so succesfully) have an advantage in practicing psionics, because they have more experience in concentrating on studying that those who
                  skip through their classes easily. There does not appear to be a marked relationship between intellect and psionic ability. There are competent psionicists on both ends of the scale, and in the middle.</p>

                  <p>You use energy to make anything at all. "Energy" is the ability to do work...including maintaining the function of your body. Increasing your stamina, is probably more useful for the purposes of your question. Slowly and progressively increasing the length and difficulty of your practice ought to
                  help.</p>
