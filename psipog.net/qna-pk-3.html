                  <p>on my first attempt at TK, i was able to move a string, and the next day i was able to make a paper clip spin. now, about 2 weeks of practice off and on, i can make 7 paper clips spin. is that normal, or is that pretty good? Also, i was able to warm up water about 3 degrees on my first try about 3

                  <p>Hey great site helps me bunches. but i wanted to know what you think on this whole telekinesis equation.</p>

                  <p>TK=CFe+ZPE-SD-E+ which basically means telekinesis = high amount of iron + zero point emotion state but reduces ability with SD which is sleep deprivation and reduces it more with an excess of E vitamins because they take away iron. please give your thoughts on if u believe this equation or not.I
                  would put link but i only compied down the equation.</p>

                  <p>It seems like everywhere I read about psychokinesis, PK, it is being done on only one object at a time, and I was wondering if it were possible to control multiple objects at once. I am quite new to using PK (can only get the psiwheel to wobble a bit x.x) so I cannot test this with my as-of-yet
                  quite limited abilities.</p>

                  <p>Tinfoil is lighter than paper, as a material, and therfor it is easier for most people to move (I prefer paper, but it seems that most people have an easier time of it when they try to go for the foil.)</p>

                  <p>If you are looking for an easier exercise (which I discourage merely because the psi-wheel is the definition of basic exercise), you can go for a foil wheel or try to move a toothpick in water.</p>

                  First off I want to say I LOVE this site . I just got into it after a friend showed me some cool stuff and we chatted hours about it . Anyway onto the question .</p>

                  <p>I ran into this site from here : <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/contents.html"

                  <p>and I did the clock test and pendulumn (I know I misspelt that) with great results and I am confused at what it actually does . Am I controlling it or is it some freaky coincidence .</p>

                  <p>"Fourmilab" is an excellent site. It is playing with Probability and Statistics, though (as is all microPK activity). To find out whether you are actually doing something, or if it is merely coincidence, you need to do the experiment a lot of times...preferably more than a hundred. Keep track of
                  your scores, and see if they are steady, or wildly fluctuating. A large number of small-but-regular pushing to one side or the other is more significant than a single score that is off the charts.</p>

                  <p>First thing is first, My name is Gavriel, and I thank you just for entering. :).</p>

                  <p>So.... do to the wealth of information in your site, I'm a bit puzzled.....</p>

                  <p>I was interested in training my self in telekinesis, especially because of the fact that when I was a child, I was able to move pieces of paper etc, without touching, and with no training......</p>

                  <p>In time that ability was forgotten, and now I can't do that, I guess, without proper training.......</p>

                  <p>So I got to your site through a recommendation of it's helpfulness, and though, when I entered the value "Telekinesis", I've got too many results! (Well done though...!)</p>

                  <p>So now I can't tell in which on to start!</p>

                  <p>I thought that if anyone, you can point me in the right direction.....</p>

                  <p>Thankfully, Gavriel.</p>

                  <p>P.S.</p>

                  <p>I'd rather not going through Meditation and stuff, in order to be able to possess that ability, though i am ready for hard training.</p>

                  <p>P.S.S.</p>

                  <p>(:P) Is it really true that some ppl are able to even move couches?!</p>

                  <p>I've been reading about psychokinesis and I have to say I'm confuse. Do you have to learn each kinesis by itself to control it (telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, etc.) or do you learn psychokinesis as a whole there by controling all of them?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>There are basically two approaches to psychokinesis: the one for microPK effects, and the one for macroPK effects. All the different targets are merely variants in the use of the basic Psychokinesis.</p>

                  <p>You can learn them separately, if you want to or if the approach you are using specifies a different method for assorted variations. Or you can learn the basics of it, and apply it to other targets than whatever you started with. Both approaches are valid, in that both approaches have worked.
                  Which you choose will depend largely on personal preference, either your own or your teacher's.</p>
