                  <p>This question is more specifically for Rainsong, but I'd be honored just to get an answer. I'm sure all of you psions have heard this one from a newbie before: How does one tell what psychic areas he/she excels in and which ones he/she lacks in? Are there any "quizzes" or "tests" I should look at?
                  Thank you for your input.</p>

                  <p>The obvious answer to this is: try it and find out. Most of the "quizzes" that you'll see are in the same category as the "is he the boy of your dreams" quizzes in teen-girls' magazines: fun if you like that kind of quiz, but useless nonetheless.</p>

                  Firstly that april fools chat thing is _EVIL_,but its very effective.Now i need some reasurence here and i need it bad, I saw the newest artical by Peebrain and Annie and i saw the photos ,thats where it went wrong I believe in this stuff all right and i no offence ment but those photos.... they look
                  fake in one of them Peebrains foot is half cut off and when you look close you can see a different colour backround around him.And in most of them there is a white outline and the one of Peebrain "flying" could possibly just be him jumping yesno?<br />
                  Once again no offence inteded to Annie or Sean.<br />

                  <p>Hello there,<br />
                  (don't worry I have not mutated or anything)<br />
                  I've been reading some of your articles and it seems like any of the kinesis abilities people seem to be interested in are dangerous or deadly. Whats up with that? I understand that newbies should step forward with caution, but not be mortally afraid of dying. If they have a goal they will do
                  anything to reach it, right? If they become experienced it should be a problem right? I have stepped forward into the telekinesis and bio-pk thing and nothing bad has happened. (OK so I ruined two good watches) but I have gotten better at pk and I have even managed to turn my eyes into a lighter
                  color temporarily with only basic knowledge of how the eyeball works. (I've only worked on the iris). Anyway, for the safety of it, would you mind telling me which abilities would be labeled as 'dangerous' or 'deadly' or even 'painful.' (such as photokinesis, aerokinesis, magnakinesis, telekinesis,
                  biokinesis, etc.)</p>

                  <p>Thank you.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>All psychokinetic abilities carry a risk. If you object to the fair warning to newbies, that is your problem. The observation of both physical injury (mortal and otherwise) is not new, nor is it hypothetical. Deal with it. If the newbies have a goal that they "will do anything to reach", isn't it
                  best that they understand what it is they are risking _before_ making that decision?</p>

                  <p>Even the perceptive abilities have some risk involved, both because of the depletion of certain chemicals in the blood and because of the risk of "spacing out" after a particularly long or intense session. The latter isn't a problem in your own bedroom at bedtime, maybe....but having your mind
                  suddenly wander off on its own while you're cruising down the Interstate is unhealthy. Of course, most of you are too young to drive.....<br /></p>

                  <p>This question concerns Rainsong's articles on Phasing. You said they hurt, and I was convivnced to not try it. I'm still not trying it, but this is just a thought: You get better with skills as you practice, so would phasing get less painful the more you do it? Like, would your body get used to
                  the feeling or something? Thankyou for taking the time to answer this. <img src="smile.gif"

                  <p>Not having practiced it, I can't say whether it would or would not. It might be that it only gets more reliable. On the other hand, there have been folks who claim that it doesn't hurt if you do it right. I don't plan to find out. (And to the less-observant among the loyal readership, I cannot
                  teach phasing, and I would refuse even if I could.)</p>

                  <p>First of all, I'm glad to hear that at least _some_ people are clever enough to figure out that phasing is not fun. As for your question, phasing had not come up in conversation before it started happening. The conversation about it happened afterward. Armed with some ideas from a friend or two,
                  and after roughly six months' work at it, I was able to stop it from happening....usually. As indicated by the second article, it happened again, quite a while later.</p>

                  <p>If you have a "bigger than average" gift for PK, it should be more obvious to you than to us, what the specifics of it might be. Think about _why_ you believe you have such a "gift".</p>

                  <p>If there has been any evidence shown _at all_ in your prior experience --objects flying around the room, electrical equipment failing or acting oddly, and so on-- you can slant your practice accordingly. In the case of "flying objects", play with chasing saltshakers around the table, and stopping
                  radiometers, and levitating pingpong balls. In the case of the electronics, try online microPK tests, and charging batteries, and forcing electrical appliances to function when they aren't plugged in (and use no batteries).</p>

                  <p>If there is no such evidence from your prior experience, then you need to consider _why_ you believe that you have an exceptional talent for pk.</p>

                  <p>Hello. I was reading over some of the questions, and I saw that animals can sense psi...Why is this? Why do they have a predisposition for sensing psi? When I was thinking about this, I figured it must have something to do with their whiskers being directly connected to their brain, or so I've

If the theory concerning psi being a by-product of the nervous system is true, then it would make sense that things with nervous systems could feel psi. I would imagine whatever mechanism that humans have that allows
                  us to sense psi, other animals have too.</p>

                  <p>Hello there.<br />
                  I'm new to this site but not to this craft. (I've had a few experiences before and it has always been my dream to become a full fledged psion). I don't mean to sound rude or anything but perhaps the info would be helpful. I have three questions that I wasn't sure where I could place them but
                  here.</p>

                  <p>1)Does the full moon affect telekinesis? I've started working on telekinesis since New Year's and every full moon I feel charged up and I can do all sorts of stuff. Does the moon have some sort of power or is it just me?</p>

                  <p>2)Is it possible to change the body using prana energy? For example-would I be, in theory, able to change sex at will with practice? (I'm not transexual or anything I'm just curious.) If something that complicated is possible than I could modify anything right? Perhaps even eyesight?</p>

                  <p>3)Is telekinesis and witchcraft related? I keep having this disturbing feeling that they're related. I want my dream of becoming a psion to come true but I don't want to offemd God...</p>

                  <p>1) The full moon appears to affect some mental processes; just ask anyone who works in a psychiatric ward or the emergency room of a hospital. Whether it affects your TK or not is open to question. It's only March, yet, so there have not been many full moons to compare, and there are other factors
                  to consider. Keep track, in writing for another year or so: moon phase, any tk data, weather, solar weather, time of day....That will give you a clearer idea of what does and does not affect you.</p>

                  <p>2) Psi can affect eyesight, as can straight biofeedback. I do not know enough about the finer points of "prana" to answer your basic question.
