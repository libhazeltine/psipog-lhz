                  <p>I was wondering if what im about to describe to you is empathy/telepathy/something in that category. ok, when im in school and i have my shield set up to repel random emotions flying around (my school has around 1000 students in it) i dont feel this weird static like feeling in the very back of my
                  conciousness. this takes up about 5% of my thinking ability. you know like storing short term emotions or that kind of thing. i dont actually hear the static, but it feels like theres cotton back there or something that you would expect to sound like static if it were translated into noise. is this
                  cottony feeling the random thoughts of the people around me or am i just crazy. (and i dont have the static thingy when i have that shield up)</p>

                  <p>I had an experience recently where I randomly felt my grandfather's emotions, stronger than I had ever felt anyone else's emotions before. I thought perhaps this was empathy, but I have not had this experience since then. Do people with natural ability for empathy start out this way? Or am I just
                  overreacting?</p>

                  <p>I'm going to give my opinion on this matter.<br />
                  I think this happens to almost everyone at least once, or from time to time. Realistically, it's nothing to freak out over. It's not symbolic of anything other than the experience itself. We get a lot of "but then this one time, &lt;uncommon experience&gt; happened. what does it MEAN?" type
                  questions.<br />

                  <p>VERY Important question. What is biofeedback and how do you do it? I saw it mentioned in any article to use it, but it didn't explain how.</p>

                  <p>This question could have just as easily been answered by a short google search on your part, but since it's sitting here I'll say a quick few words.<br />
                  The term "biofeedback" was coined 1969 to describe labratory procedures (developed in the 1940s) that trained research subjects to alter brain activity, blood pressure, muscle tension, heart rate, and other bodily functions that are not normally controlled voluntarily. Biofeedback is a training
                  technique in which people are taught to improve their health and performance by using signals from their own bodies.<br />
                  To address your how-to question: this varies from person to person. I suggest researching occupational therapy, as well as doing your own tests and trials.</p>

                  <p>Hey everyone.This has become a big problem for me, as well as a very confusing one. It really started a few weeks ago at school in math class,I was day dreaming as usual. When all these random thoughts flooded my mind.They where not related to math class,or anything I would think of at all. They
                  where complety random things. And no matter how much I tried,I could not prevent this flood of nonsense. It finally stoped after about three minutes. I dident think it was that big of a problem. But, It happened again 4 days later at the mall.This time more intense.Floods of nonsense bombarded me.And
                  once more, later today.This has gotten to be a big annoyence,and This is perplexing as Im not training in Telepathy anymore.Is there a way to 'shut it off'?</p>

                  <p>If it is assorted nonsense, it probably originates in your own mind. Paying attention to your math class (or to whatever you're doing in the mall....shopping, chatting with buddies, etc) ought to take care of the problem.</p>

                  <p>Ok, I've always...always felt this, but only now I have remembered to ask you guys!</p>

                  <p>Practically everytime I am around someone or see someone who is angry and shouting at some one, or I say if we're in the car and see someone driving dangerously near us or something like that (its hard to describe lol) I get like a BIG shiver...and its as if I feel the "bad vibes" or something
                  like that. I don't really know how to explain it very well.</p>

                  <p>Do you think it could be that I am sensitive to negative energy from people and should work on shielding, or what? Does this happen to anyone else?</p>

                  I wasn't really sure whether this question belonged here or under 'manupliation', so I decided to psot it here. Anyway, in annie's sheilding seminar, she says that she will stick around to check out other people's sheilds. how exactly do you do that. What I mean is, is this accomplished through
                  scanning of the person's feild, clairvoyance, or some other mechanism? Also, can this same techinque be used to sense constructs? Thanks.</p>

                  <p>As Peebrain outlined in his "Speaking with your Subconsious" article, the Subconsious typically speaks in emotions. Could it be possible that I have accidently already put in a translator into songs that evoke specific emotions?<br />
                  I'm guessing this since even when I've got my thoughts out during meditation, I still have a song playing in my mind that usually compares to my current mood.</p>

                  <p>I would suppose that makes sense, though I've never really thought about that. I don't know, really. Perhaps the subconscious is bored and just "humming" a song? Heh. Or maybe your mind is not used to doing nothing, so in an attempt to do SOMETHING, it just grabs a song. But if it relates to your
                  emotions, perhaps there's a little logic behind which song it grabs. Well... (as you can probably tell, I'm thinking this out while typing it <img src="blah.gif"

                       class="smileyImg" />)... people like songs because it releases certain chemicals in your brain called endorphins. Perhaps your body wants a certain kind of endorphin, based on your current stress, and chooses to "play a song" to try to generate those specific endorphins? Heh, as you can see, I'm
                       just throwing ideas out there. Good question - I'm sure it's much more complicated than just a few paragraphs of information.</p>

                  Well, I read Peebrain's article on how to communicate with your subconsious, and it sounds interesting. So to any moderator who has had experience in communicating with the subconsious: It is possible to ask your subconsious to do something such as, "Improve my eyesight to 20/20" or "Increase my
                  metabolism to lose weight", or basically anything related to improving the health of the physical body? And would it actually work?</p>

You have to be careful with things like that though - if you tip the scales to improve one thing, chances are you're screwing up something else in another spot. Work slowly, and make sure each little step you take is healthy.

                  <p>After reading through most of the articles on this site, I came to the one about talking to your subconscious. I thought it was kind of silly until it was read , at which point I realized I could do that. Always recieving feelings, I am. At times I'm able to ask it questions, and while it doesn't
                  reply in words usually, I always get an answer feeling. I also get feelings from it to do things for no reason, like putting a book in a drawer, or turning the computer off. That's all fine and dandy, but the thing is it seems to be quite negative and likes to critique me a lot. I'd like to be sure
