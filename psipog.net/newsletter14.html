Dear PsiPog Users,

If you're reading this, then I'm currently away in Basic Training
for the Air Force! Oh goodness :-). In the meantime, the other
moderators will be helping with the newsletter. Remember to send
all comments, suggestions, ideas, questions, etc... to:
newsletter@psipog.net

Thanks for reading, and thanks to the moderators who have stepped
up to help out :-).

Hiya Poggers! Our fearless leader Peebrain has left for bootcamp,
and in his absence we (Annie, Mannen, and Roy) will do our best
to continue to put forth spectacular newsletters!

We have received tons of e-mails, so let's go through a few of
them and we'll try to answer your questions.

Hi!
Lately I've observed an interesting thing with visualisation.  I
visualise, e.g. an orange and I cut it in half by a knife or
something, then I merge it.  Everything's OK, but after a few
seconds the orange fall apart in half again. My friends have the
same problem as me. Is it possible to avoid visualizing the half
splitting again?

Our Comments:
I think this is a very common problem, actually. I've had it
myself several times, and I remember struggling with it when I
was very young. Again, the secret word is practice. Try
visualizing a whole scene, keep adding more and more detail to
it, and if you lose it, start over. Keep doing this until you can
keep a lot of details. I hope this helps!

This is strange...
I cannot make a psiball yet (I'm more a telepath and empath), but
I needed to make a shield (I was getting overwhelmed). I tried
making a psiball, but once again I was not able to under stress.
I tried a new method. I visualized psi moving out of my body,
making a bubble around me, and continuously circulating and
turning incoming emotions into psi and using them to feed the
shield. It only works in high emotion areas (a.k.a. school) but
it is interesting. It's not a "hard" shield, it doesn't block,
but it does turn down the volume considerably.

Our Comments:
That's a good idea Packy! This is a good example of doing what
works for you. For the most part we all function the same way
psionically, however our methods and visualizations for doing
such vary greatly. As far as your shield is concerned, Packy,
you are only programming it to stabilize itself with incoming
energies. You can try to program it to be a "hard" shield as
well, which could help to further dampen or block out any forms
of unwanted telepathy or energy.

Hi there!
I am just wondering if anyone can help me with looking into the
future. Actually, a few years ago I had an experience of seeing
a scene for about 3 sec. and after 2 weeks from that time, there
it was, the one I saw from my vision. It was like this: I was on
a boat and sitting on the side, watching outside the window when
in less than a second the view a few feet away suddenly changed
while inside the boat remained at the present.

Our Comments:
Wow, sounds like a case of spontaneous precognition. Here's what
you can do to try and train yourself to receive more precognitive
information: each night try to make predictions about the next
day. Be sure to record all of your predictions in a notebook to
keep track of your hits and misses. What you predict can be as
simple as what will happen in school, or more complex
predictions, such as major world events. I'd start small and
work your way up, though. Good luck! (On a side note, I'd like to
give credit to Rainsong who originally informed me of this method
of practice.)

Hello, I have a question: a friend and I have been practicing
telekinesis but we haven't had very good results. Sometimes we
send some colors to our minds, they are sometimes correct, but
some others aren't. Could you please tell me an exercise guide
and also techniques about psi balls?

Our Comments:
Ok, well first it's good to see that you're experimenting with
multiple abilities rather than sticking with just one. Whether it
is telekinesis, telepathy, or energy manipulation, it cannot be
stressed enough that practice plays a tremendous role in your
improvement! Practice, practice, practice! As far as exercise
guides and techniques for psiballs, there are plenty on the
psipog website. Best of luck!

=================================================================

Ok guys, let's finish this newsletter off with a practice tool
that some people may overlook. It's a simple deck of cards. You
can use them to practice just about every ability. Here's a few
examples:
1) Psychometry: Shuffle the deck and place 5 cards face down in
front of you. Try to guess the color, suit, and number/face of
each of the cards when you touch the objects.
2) Telepathy: Find a partner and have each person take half of
the deck. Go back and forth sending and receiving the cards.
Playing cards have both shapes and colors, though not as many as
you would encounter playing a game of S+C.
3) Telekinesis: This one will require a bit of imagination. You
can throw a card in the air, and then try to throw off it's
flight course while it's in mid air. Stack two cards against each
other and try to knock them over with TK.
4) Precognition: My brother and I used to play a game we dubbed
"Who Will Run Out of Cards First". You'll need two people for
this game. Shuffle the deck, and give each person half of the
deck. Figure out who will go first, and then that person will try
to guess what card he will flip over next from his half of the
deck. When someone gets a hit (guesses correctly), he stops
guessing and the other person does the same thing. The first
person to run out of cards is the loser.

Good luck with this, and remember, have fun with it!
