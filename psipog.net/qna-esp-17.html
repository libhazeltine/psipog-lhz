                  <p>I have a few questions about empathy, because I feel like they may not have been answered previously just quite right, I could be wrong though. ^_^</p>

                  <p>Do ALL naturally strong/sensitive empaths need to have problems being in large crowds, malls, etc.? Is it not possible that they subconsciously at a young age developed strong sheilds. Or filters, so that they enjoy all the diverse energies around them?</p>

                  <p>And in order to regain the feeling part of others feelings, not just the knowing, remove the walls they put up as a child? Granted this is part of telepathy, as empathy is...</p>

                  <p>It just seems from what I've read, people claim that if one is "untrained" they should not be able to tolerate lots of people in a large group. Again, I could be wrong, or misinformed.</p>

                  <p>And, if I want to remove my walls, what is the best way that you would recommend that I do this? I am curious as to the various methods that people use to take down their walls, and open up to their natural perception.</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>It is _possible_ to have developed such shielding. It is, however, rather unusual to have done so. Some Empaths do indeed enjoy the sensory overload of contact with large crowds. Some even choose to engage in the so-called "feeding" on the mess of psi-stuff produced by such crowds.</p>

                  <p>If you're in a large crowd, "knowing" what it feels does not require any kind of psychic empathy. It doesn't even require psychological empathy. _If_ such walls are there, then taking them down again should open the person up to such perceptions. Of the people who have asked me about this, the
                  vast majority had no such walls, nor any kind of unusual level of empathy, walls or no. There are perhaps half a dozen who actually had such things; again, of those who have asked me, personally.</p>

                  <p>Trained folks can --and often do-- have as much trouble as untrained folks. The difference is in "what kind of trouble", "what they choose to do about it", and "whether they recognise what the problem is". Among untrained folks, it _seems_ that the more common problem is picking up other people's
                  psychiatric problems, and attempting suicide as a result.</p>

                  <p>Such walls as I _have_ seen are generally dismantled by a third party, in the same way that any other kind of shield would be dismantled by a third party. Not much difference from other kinds of shields, after all. Some of the "walls" are inclined to re-build themselves.</p>

                  <p>im learning telepathy but none of my friends are into it.i also dont want anyone of my family members to find out or else they might make me stop(its not against any religous rules or anything i just dont think they will like it).since i cant tell anybody how will i practice telepathy because in

                  <p>By definition, telepathy is communication between two or more minds. If you do not have another person with whom to practice, you cannot practice. It is that simple. The "person" need not necessarily be human, but verifying data with interspecies communication is difficult.</p>

                  <p>hello everyone, my question is on telepathy. ok here it goes, when Im playing guess the shape and color in your practice room i get about 88% correct on my answers, but my question is how do you know that what your receiving is the actual thought of the other person or just your immagination?</p>

               <div class="qnaAns">
                  <p>If it is consistently right, you're picking up data of some form. If not, you _probably_ are not (there are some weird inverted results which are statistically significant --and can even be useful-- but give results far _worse_ than can be attributed to pure chance).</p>

                  <p>88% is quite good, really, over the long term. You don't indicate how many times you've played, though.</p>

                  <p>The short answer, though, is that you generally _don't_ know whether "what you're receiving" is the real thing, or imagined. That's a large part of the reason for the protocols in Remote Viewing, for example: to have a way to weed out some of the imagined "data".</p>

                  <p>In Yumper's RP article and the seminar, i've noticed they talk about RPing to a location you haen't visited before, my question is, How would you get to the place if you didn't know what it looked like, or where exactly it's located..eg, i know my friend's address, but i dont know how the streets
                  leading to the place look like. If i try to RP to a place i haven't visited before, how should i go about it? I hope you understand what i'm asking, it may sound a little confusing..<br />

                  <p>I'm not exactly sure how RP works, but I believe you can just target a person, and "zoom out" from there. For example, focus on your friend... try to RP close to your friend. Read up SunTzu's article on Clairvoyance.</p>

Pretty much how it works normally - just for some strange reason, I can tell some greens from reds, and other greens I can't tell. You might be able to receive it in the form of a word, but really receiving it in

Like your target knows about mowing lawns and tractors, so you can read them to get information on it? That's possible too. How long will it take to learn? Depends on you. Could take a week

               <div class="qnaQues">
                  <p>Hello,</p>

                  <p>I am a 16 teen year old with an accute sense of empathy. While I have always known I had an ability you can imagin I was hoping for something more showy. I come from a long line of ppl with psi powers. My mother and my grandmother have various ablities. Most of them linked with telepathy and
                  precognition. So naturally I assumed I would follow in the same way. I was wrong. Recently my base ablities have sharpened remarkably. I am private school educated and if I was making this up TRUST me I would have picked a more flashy and advertised talent. My empathy is a little different from the
                  way it is described here. By focusing on a person I can recieve their emotions. But the connection is made in my mind. Not in anyway connected with the heart. Also I feel emotions in waves and they have various colors. Now no I do not see a rainbow in my head. White, light blue, gray, and black are
                  the only ones I've gotten so far. Sorry if I sound pissed off but I am just defensive when talking about something most ppl can't and won't understand or believe. So I write to you seeking guidence. I am worried that if I connect to ppl that I will hurt them. I've come to the conclusion that it may
                  be IMMORAL to do this with a degree of control. I plan to run tests on myself asap. But in the mean time I want to know if there is anything that can help me control my empathy. I can already easily read emotions. I am worried with time I will be able to manipulate them. I need to be able to control
                  this. Else I could push someone to an extream without even knowing it. If my subconsious got the best of me it would be unforgivable. I was also wondering about telepathy. Though whenever I tried I've been unsuccesful I have done this once. I was reading someones emotions and saw what they were
                  thinking. This leads me to believe they are related. So in summation I am interesting in devolping my empathy and forging some kind of telepathy in me if possible. Also if you are or know of any other Empaths would you please put them in contact with me? I feel very alone in this. With a talent I've
                  never heard of anyone else having this accutely.....it's scary.</p>

                  <p>That's fine that you perceive your empathy slightly different than we describe. This stuff isn't written in stone, and it depends on the individual. To control empathy, you'll need to learn to shield. I suggest reading the first few chapters of my eBook ( <a href="ebook.html"
                     target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/ebook.html</a> ), and also reading the articles in the Manipulation category. And, of course, practice.</p>

                  <p>As far as telepathy... empathy and telepathy do seem to be related. Some psions don't even partition the two, and consider them the same ability. Personally, I'm empathetic, and I can use my empathy to sometimes "extend" it in a sense to receive thought patterns. Like you described.</p>
