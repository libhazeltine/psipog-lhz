<br />
Sometimes when I lay down in my bed at night, I begin to feel something rushing through my forehead into my brain. It&#039;s a quite uncomfortable feeling - having something pushed through the skull..<br />
<br />
I have experienced this maybe 2-3 times only. It usually happens after I have been willing to learn something fast.<br />
<br />
The first time I had wished for being able to understand math good enough for school. I was lying on my back with my head towards the window. Then when I was almost dreaming, suddenly I felt a slight pressure on my forehead that woke me up. The pressure was gradually increasing. I also began to feel the stream that flowed through my skull. After about an hour or so, when the pressure was already hard to tolerate, I turned my head away from the window (I felt it coming through the window), but the stream slowly followed my forehead. I then panicked and closed the stream (I don&#039;t know how I did it, but I felt the pressure slowly dropping). <br />
<br />
With every experience the stream seems to have broadened and the amount of pressure decreased. While at the first time the area that the stream penetrated, was about the size of cm x cm. Yesterday the area encompassed almost my whole forehead. There is another thing I noticed yesterday - it was the first time that I felt the stream flowing through the front of my brain and being focused somewhere near the center of the brain.<br />
<br />
Well, I hope it&#039;s information or psi that is flowing through and not some symptoms of some disease and that it isn&#039;t somehow dangerous to my health. <br />
Yesterday, when I had this feeling again, I began to worry about it.<br />
I think that I worry about it because I can&#039;t verify, read or decompress that &quot;something&quot; that I feel. I don&#039;t even know if this really is extending my knowledge or improving any skills.<br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone has experienced something similar..<br />
<br />
Thank You</div>

I have experienced that feeling, I don&#039;t like it. It has nothing to do with a disease, at least for me...it is a type of psi from what I know, I will tell you more, but first, can you tell me any more about the feeling? I know that it is hard to describe, but are there certain thoughts that come up? Or do you feel a prescence? I have to go, but if you tell me more, I can tell you what I know, if I think it is still the same, it sounds very similar, when I get home.</div>

The first time I experienced this, I actually had a headache.<br />
After the first time though, I haven&#039;t felt anything like a headache or dizzyness either before, during or after the experience.<br />

I probably haven&#039;t felt any presence during this (not so sure about this one). <br />

<br />
I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t give much more details since I&#039;m just not sensitive enough to be able to recognize feelings / thoughts that are related to the experience and the ones that I&#039;m probably making up.<br />

There was a physical symptom, similar to what you have described, but beyond that I could sense a prescence. It was as if they were looking for something. The first time was very frightening, not just because of the feeling but for other reasons. Would someone want to know something from or about you? Then limit it down to people who would be able to do that. Do you know anyone psionic? Also, how far apart are they?<br />
<br />
My suggestion, see if you don&#039;t feel a prescence. Maybe I was able to feel it because I can be highly sensitive to things, but try to be more sensitive. The only problem with trying that while something like this is happening is that you then start to think about it too much to define it. It is not just extraordinary thoughts people might want, mundane things. What whoever it was wanted from me was just normal stuff, not really wow things. I am fortunate to know that it was someone, found out afterwards, but only after I thought I was nuts for a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts, as well as my experience. Adivce? If you think that this is what it is...learn to shield! Unfortunately I have difficulties with shielding, not entirely, but they are just very...weak. If you can that might help, but if it is not &quot;hacking&quot; and it is internal that would not help, but then shielding doesn&#039;t stop all people...<br />
<br />
I would love to hear if you think it might be &quot;hacking.&quot; I have been really curious about it since my experiences but have lacked someone with a similar one to talk to about it. Do you think that it could be someone? or do you think it is something different?</div>

		<div id="post_10249" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">While writing the last post, I remembered that I had practiced something like this maybe a few months before the experience. I visualized formulas flying into my head and me understanding them. Well, I didn&#039;t even believe it would work.<br />
<br />
After remembering this, I had about 5 hours to think about this. During that 5h, I remembered some of my grades. After the first time I felt this pressure on my forehead, my understanding of math really did improve quite drastically. Actually, the teacher even sent me out of the class and said &quot;You can go home, you have nothing to learn here..&quot;<br />
I thought it was strange (the year before I was one of the worst students in the class at maths), but I didn&#039;t pay much attention to it.<br />
<br />
I think that it must have been information, but only for the subconscious. And maybe that&#039;s what makes the improvement hard to notice.<br />
<br />
Yes, it might have been that I just solved more exercises and learned more at home. However, I remember that I didn&#039;t solve any exercises at home and I didn&#039;t even pay attention to what the teacher said. It was 2 years later that my grades started to lose balance again. And it was then that I had to begin practicing mathematics at home ( sometimes even 13 hours every day and 2 weeks in a row :-P ) in order to keep my grades more or less normal.<br />
<br />
Thank You</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10249">While writing the last post, I remembered that I had practiced something like this maybe a few months before the experience. I visualized formulas flying into my head and me understanding them. Well, I didn&#039;t even believe it would work.

After remembering this, I had about 5 hours to think about this. During that 5h, I remembered some of my grades. After the first time I felt this pressure on my forehead, my understanding of math really did improve quite drastically. Actually, the teacher even sent me out of the class and said &quot;You can go home, you have nothing to learn here..&quot;
I thought it was strange (the year before I was one of the worst students in the class at maths), but I didn&#039;t pay much attention to it.

I think that it must have been information, but only for the subconscious. And maybe that&#039;s what makes the improvement hard to notice.

Yes, it might have been that I just solved more exercises and learned more at home. However, I remember that I didn&#039;t solve any exercises at home and I didn&#039;t even pay attention to what the teacher said. It was 2 years later that my grades started to lose balance again. And it was then that I had to begin practicing mathematics at home ( sometimes even 13 hours every day and 2 weeks in a row :-P ) in order to keep my grades more or less normal.

		<div id="post_10250" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I experienced similar feeling quite often. Recently it stopped. I remember one thing that always helped - get some fresh air. Close your eyes and relax, breathe deeply. Perhaps brain needs more oxygen when working hard for an extended period of time. I remember drinking water also used to help.<br />
As I said, it recently stopped. I can only guess a few changes I made, I can&#039;t REALLY tell what stopped it. <br />
I became vegetarian, it highly improved my mental clarity.<br />
I meditate every day.<br />
I became a strong optimist.<br />
I drink much more water than before.<br />

I hope I helped</div>
