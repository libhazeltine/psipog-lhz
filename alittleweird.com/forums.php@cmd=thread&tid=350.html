		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_8061">Oh my god, I just realized I had another freaky experience! 

I&#039;ve spoken with my mom about the day I was having, and suddenly I had a pressure in my ears so I couldn&#039;t hear my mom .In that same moment I heared noises of people shouting at each other about somthing that was worth shouting at... I don&#039;t know what it was. The shouting became less and less hearable and I recognized my mom keep talking at me.

It lasted about 8 seconds top and my mom didn&#039;t noticed I wasn&#039;t listing to her.
the event happend in my frontyard with just the two of us outside ( including the neighboors and people in the street).

someone had that too? I&#039;m not blofing and making this up, I swear =)</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

<br />
One, the most recent, involved sleep paralysis. I Was trying to stay up, I wasn&#039;t really tired, but I kept on having a feeling of nodding off, and each time it took me longer and longer to force my body to move. At about the third time that it happened, I had at that point still a sight of my room, I could even see, but I was linked to my body. I remember trying to move my body, I felt the signal going from my brain to the muscles, but my body wouldn&#039;t move. Instead, I felt a weight there. I then Started to see a figure above me, almost, holding me down, but not with any physical force. It looked down at me, although I couldn&#039;t see the eyes. I jumped up at the very end, as if I had just broken free from a huge force against me. With this, I Shielded myself, performed a spirit warding ritual, and then relaxed for a while before going back to sleep. The funny thing is, I still have the picture of this figure in my mind. He had an obsenely (sp?) long beard and a short stature, It reminded me of a Dwarf...<br />
<br />
a little less recent.<br />
<br />
It was about 3 in the morning( I was at a friends house ) and I was awake. I have chronic insomnia, so many nights my body won&#039;t let me sleep. Anyway, because of this, I decided to practice my manipulation before I went to sleep. I woke one of them for the experience, and I started prcticing. I started to creat a psiball, and I started, believe it or not, to produce a blue ball of light. I tried different emotions and the light changed color accordingly. It was weird, but not nesicarily creepy. I can&#039;t really verify this, because I was very tired at the time, but it was still fun.<br />
<br />
When I was young..<br />
<br />
My parents tell me that when I was young, I had, in their words, &quot;hauntings by demons&quot;. They told me that I told them that I saw grandma (my great, great gradma, who died before I was born), and that she protectedme that night. It&#039;s Weird, to think about that.<br />

I think one was at camp a couple of years ago. I kept seeing a dark figure in a cloak.<br />
<br />
Um...there was one time i was staying at a convent and I was really embarrassed (monthly thing). Any way I was crying because of that and because it had been a week since I&#039;d been home (i was half way across the world. I&#039;m a sucker for my family, sue me) then I&#039;m not really sure what I did or said, but I was lying in bed and crying...and then I suddenly felt a hand holding mine (none real hand, no one was in the room). Anyway, I felt a lot better after that. <br />
<br />
So, I would have to say, besides emotional spasms, Those are the only real weird incidences I&#039;ve had. I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re psych related or not.<br />

&quot;Nothing is Easy, But if it&#039;s difficult, then you&#039;re doing it wrong.&quot;<br />

I don&#039;t remember who said it, but it&#039;s a really good quote ^_^.<br />
<br />
Now, as for you RazSh18, I really dont&#039;t remember how I did it. I guess I could say that you should at first, really concentrate of the visualization of the psiball, and then, let go of the thought andlet your subconcience direction take hold. After that, It changes with your emotion... I&#039;m really not sure if the experiencewas completely &quot;real&quot; or not, but this is what I can gather from in nonetheless.<br />

also, you might want to have to have strong emotions or feelings at the time of doing this, I think it would make the colors brighter.</div>

<br />
1. On one occasion, when I was testing out manipulation for one of the first times, I absorbed energy and could have sworn that it made hundreds of hairs all over my body stand on end as if I was producing a massive static electric field. I remember it lasted for as long as I was absorbing energy. I was never able to duplicate this effect thereafter.<br />
<br />
2. Another experience that I had dealt with what I believed to be some kind of symbolic clairvoyance. I was taking a shower and I suddenly saw, in my mind&#039;s eye, the door to the bathroom slowly open by itself, only to reveal darkness behind it. I was disturbed to say the least.<br />
<br />
3. Throughout my sophomore year in high school, I always felt that one of the girls in my gym class was extremely evil and sadistic. She showed no outward sign of being such. In fact, she often smiled and seemed like a friendly person that I would otherwise have not had a problem being around. I just always felt it deep down that she was evil, so much so that I avoided speaking and being near her at all costs.<br />
<br />
4. The most intense and probably the strangest experience I had was my first (and so far only) (supposed) experience with an apparition (ghost). I saw the (supposed) apparition with my peripheral/indirect vision and saw that it vanished in an instant by the time I had raised my head high enough to look at it directly. The strange thing was that it actually had a strong presence like that of a person right behind you breathing down your neck, but it wasn&#039;t even that close to me. It&#039;s presence was so human that I irrationally thought that it was my brother who had just entered the apartment. The moment it vanished, I left my irrational stupor and remembered that my brother wasn&#039;t a blue vaporous substance shaped like a person! Upon realizing that it wasn&#039;t my brother, the hairs on my body stood on end in fright instantaneously. Following that encounter, I was extremely weak and depressed for about two weeks straight. The weakness and depression ended intantaneously during my English class. It happened when I began to more attention to the teacher&#039;s lecture (I always had a problem paying attention in class when I was young and suffered the consequences). Right when I had resolved to pay attention for the rest of the period, I could have sworn that I saw what looked just like cigarrette smoke (no joke) come out of my mouth and disappear from my vision. It was as if the ghost had been inside me the whole time (probably feeding off of my energy) and had decided to leave. Not too surprisingly, my depression ceased after it had left my body. Shortly after that, I experienced a feeling of intense euphoria (bliss/genuine happiness) that lasted for several days straight. During that time, I was strangely able to do my homework faster and I felt a strong desire to learn everything I possibly could. It was completely unlike me and my family was curious as to why I returned to my normal self so quickly, as they thought that it was a permanent change of character. I was mad that I lost that wonderful bliss so quickly, but I was interested to see the effects that the paranormal experience seemed to have on my academic performance. I was somehow able to focus much more and I was able to raise my grades from C&#039;s and D&#039;s to A&#039;s and B&#039;s over the course of several weeks. On top of all that, my memory seemed to improve dramatically, so much so that I was able to bewilder classmates by consistently and accurately rattling off boring statistics and facts during class trivia games. I was like a one man army in trivia that everyone wanted on their team. To this day I am still puzzled as to what the hell happened to me.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on any of these crazy experiences?<br />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
I wonder if that supposed apparition was actually someone having an OBE. Just food for thought.</div>
