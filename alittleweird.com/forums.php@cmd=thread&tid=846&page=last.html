		<div id="post_15160" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Before I actually ask my question, I&#039;d like to point out I&#039;ve read all of the guides on Psipog about <em>forming</em> a psiball, the general gist being to find a source of energy, and channel it into a ball through visualization. I figured I&#039;d start out with the method described in <a href="http://psipog.net/art-psiball-log.html" target="_blank" title="http://psipog.net/art-psiball-log.html">Peebrain&#039;s seminar</a>.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t had much success so far. I have no problem with visualization (actually sometimes I can&#039;t make up my mind about how to visualize energy, which might be a problem in itself), and I successfully &quot;felt&quot; the energy in my stomach twice. <br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t been able to go past this first step, though. The first time, I tried moving it up through my body like the guide said, but the energy seemed to dissipate as it moved up through my chest. The second time, I think I got too excited (my heart rate went up) and, again, I lost track of the energy. Ever since then, I haven&#039;t been able to feel the energy again.<br />
<br />
From what I already know, I figured that either I wasn&#039;t concentrating enough, or that something was off with my energy. If so, does anyone know any tips about how to concentrate more, or anything that might be affecting my energy? (I hear orange juice helps increase it?) Or could there possibly be any other problems?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry if the answer to my question is an obvious one. Thanks to whoever takes the time to read this. I hope someone can help.</div>

		<div id="post_15162" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I am no expert on Psi, but let me give you some answers that have helped most of my students in the past when it came to the basics of Energy Manipulation.<br />
<br />
First of all, learning a new skill takes time(!) and practice(!), no matter what path you follow, you are going to need to practice a lot. Don&#039;t expect results when you&#039;ve just practiced for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
The thing is, most people start practicing Psionics and think they can immediately jump into Energy Manipulation, Psychokinesis and all sorts of fancy stuff. Though these people get sóme results most of the time, the results are questionable. (I am NOT saying that there everyone&#039;s skill here is, I am talking about the majority of teens who want to practice Psionics.)<br />
<br />
Now that we&#039;ve got that cleared up, I recommend most people to not dive directly into these things, practice thought discipline and your imagination first. Most people have just.. crappy minds, their mind is filled with thousand thoughts at a time, and they are building castles in the air the whole day. If you want to get real results, you need to get out of this bad habit.<br />
<br />
So, what do you need to do? First, start with thought discipline, this involves keeping a single thought in your mind for as long as possible. At first, you will only succeed in a few seconds, later for minutes, just don&#039;t give up! Persistence is the key! Don&#039;t expect to have this down in a few days, start with about 5 minutes, and build it up to 20. If you can do 20 minutes of thought discipline, you can call congratulate yourself, because this is more than most people will ever achieve in this world. If you think this is too hard, aim low, you don&#039;t have to aim high, just keep improving.<br />
<br />
After the mind has been adequately trained, (let&#039;s say you can keep a single thought in your mind for a consistent 5 minutes,) it is time to turn to training the imaginative faculty. Training this is like training visualization, though you try to employ all the senses. Start with the visual sense, put, for example, a pencil on your desk and stare at it for a minute. When the minute is over, close your eyes, and try to recreate it as minutely as possible. (Don&#039;t worry about the small details now, I am talking about the basic shape and color.) Try to increase the amount of time you can hold this visualization. After a time, try more complex objects, and after these have been masterd, try moving objects. Same goes for training the imaginative ear, and training yourself in tacticle visualizations. (technically you could also practice smelling and tasting, but for our purposes, this will suffice.) For the imaginative ear, listen to the ticking of a click, and try to replicate it, etc. etc. I am sure you can think of a few things yourself.<br />
<br />
Now, reading through all this, you might think &quot;Whatever! I don&#039;t care about all this junk, I want to learn Psionics!&quot;, there is nothing I can do to help you with that, you have to develop the virtue of patience for yourself. If you don&#039;t want to start small, then follow your own path, if you start with these small exercises however, I promise you that you will not only see an improvement in your Psionic skills, but in your concentration and mental state in general.<br />

I guess my main problem really is concentration, so I&#039;ll start practicing thought exercises like these before I start messing around with psionics.<br />
<br />
Update: I meditated (pretty badly) for a good chunk of the afternoon, then I went on a walk to get away from the house. I&#039;m pretty sure I created one or two psiballs. I tried making one using my own energy a couple times, then I tried using energy from the sun, which surprisingly worked. The second one I made using the same method, but I&#039;m unsure if it was real or not.</div>

For you psiball problem, if energy dissipation is a big problem for you, try pooling the psi directing into your hands. If that fails, try altering your visualization.</div>
