Intresting seraphimfire, is this like flicking your hair back and causeing people to stare (serious, I can sort of do that), hey also has anyone been told they sort of radiate light when happpy.</div>Yes to the radiating light, nonconformist, actually I have as well. Your post made me think of a friend I used to have who always would comment that I was glowing every time I was elated. That was before I had been introduced to anything that you would find on the pages of this site ;) Thinking about it, I think that it is quite possible that she was seeing my aura. I find it easier to see auras in moments of high emotion, like when we are emoting a powerful feeling. I think that to an untrained eye during one of these moments of high emotion, extreme happiness for example, they might be detecting an aura, just not the colour entirely, so it simply results in a sort glow. I know that before I could detect colours in auras what I saw was like a clear haze radiating off of people. Intresting thought I guess, I would guess what I have said. That they are seeing a form of the aura. What are your thoughts? Would you agree with that? I can&#039;t think up anything that would explain it any better, but then I could be way off base...<br />

Anyways, I just had my first OBE. It was wierd, I walked outside of my room in OBE but instead of walking it was like I was sorta hovering around.

1) i was at my job, taching little kids to read, and sitting down reading. I looked up and looked around the room. I looked at the door going into the hall and it was all wierd. it was likw when you look at the road when it is really hot out and the heat is rising, but it came from all directions the sides up and down all going towards the middle it was so wierd that i couldnt take my eyes off of it. <br />
<br />
2) i was laying in bed and decided to try to OBE at least my arm. i havent had any luck with obe but still i try. i decided to try and split my physical and energy body. it was odd. my arm in the middle and all my energy, still in arm form on either side. I opened my eyes and nothing. i couldnt feel my real arm but i could feel two energy hands. i then moved both energy arms back. i still couldnt feel my real arm fully and it really hurt. it was patchy. like some energy was back but some parts had no energy. it took a while but finally i gathered enough energy to patch it up. <br />
comments anyone.   <br />

		<div id="post_10416" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">last night at work i had an odd experiance. i had a container that had lettuce in it and was bringing it in back to wash. (if anyone has been to a subway it is the containers that hold the vegitables.) i sat it down by the register to tell a customer the soda was working again. i was holding onto it the whole time while it was there. it then &quot;flew&quot; out of my hands and hit the soad cooler about four feet away. right after it happened i was really tired and dizzy. i think it was me but i dont know. crazy. <br />
on the same note a few weeks back i was really overwhelmed by the supper rush at work while working alone. i set an empty mayo bottle down and went back to get another. i went back to the fridge, (very pissed off at the people before me) and when i turned around the mayo bottle &quot;jumped&quot; off the counter and onto the floor about two feet from where it was. <br />

<br />
I have the feeling though that you have an invader you aren&#039;t aware of. let me explain; during meditation, you eventually are to enter into your &quot;inner world&quot;. This world is your mind, it is you.<br />
<br />
When you have a form of imbalance it is represented as a spirit in your world. In meditation, sometimes you can ask it to leave, if it is a good spirit, it will. But sometimes, if this spirit is restless or dark (if a created spirit, you may not want it to leave and this will happen) it will be stubborn and unwilling to leave for you and may get even more dark in it&#039;s attempts.<br />
<br />
Basically all I&#039;m saying is that It may just be a problem you&#039;re hiding from yourself, or it could be a poltergeist... either way, if you have the will, you have the way. </div>

<br />
There&#039;s this room at work my friend and I named the &quot;Scary Room&quot;. It&#039;s basically a loft, because the warehouse where we work used to be rented by a guy who lived there and used the space for woodworking and stuff. Anyways, my job was to go up there and clean it out, so it would be useable =P. I went up there, and constantly felt like someone was staring at me. I glanced around, no one was there, but there was kind of a suffocating feeling. I went down and told my brother I was a bit freaked, so he told my friend &quot;She&#039;s getting a bit claustrophobic. You think you could take over?&quot; She did, and a few minutes later she came down and said she felt like someone was watching her. He told us to both go up there and get a grip, so we did. It was still about the same amount of freaky. Then the feeling of suffocation got really bad...she didn&#039;t feel anything, but knew something wasn&#039;t right. Then the lights turned off. Neither of us were near the switch. We both hightailed it outta there =P Me, being the logical person I am, looked for another switch or a timer, but there wasn&#039;t one.<br />
<br />
Somewhat relating to the first story, the same friend I was with previously invited me to go to the mall. (This was a few weeks later.) There was this awesome floor under the Cinema area where hardly anybody went that had a bunch of videogames :) When we went down, no one was there. I played on the escalator some (Up on down, down on up =P), then we played Time Crisis. When we turned to go back upstairs, the crane in the grab game moved by itself. Not one of those swaying things, but actually moved like someone was there playing. Neither of us had put in money, touched it, and no one else was even on that floor.<br />
<br />
Stuff like that only happens when we&#039;re together =P I know she&#039;s slightly telekinetic. She moved this one floaty thing that I was moving at a snails pace (but hey, it was moving where I wanted it to) like it was a freakin motorboat =P but she was to lazy to pursue any abilities. *shrugs* I had to practically drag her over to my house to prove I really did move something with my mind...all my other friends thought I was lying (to be honest, she did too) &gt;.&lt;</div>

Does your ability change with emotion (i.e, when you change your &quot;long term&quot; outlook on life)?<br />
<br />
I have more or less the same ability, but it&#039;s long term rather than short term. In other words, as my long term outlook on life (otherwise known as the way I view the experience of life as a whole) changes, so does the general structure of my face.<br />
<br />
I wish I could explain it more but that is probably my worst ability -_-... The more &quot;filled with wonder&quot; I am about life, the more childlike my appearance is, and the more resolute I am about it, the more &quot;chiseled&quot; my expression tends to be ^_-.<br />
<br />
I guess if you could root out and control these emotions you could &quot;shape shift&quot;, so to speak, but frankly I haven&#039;t put forth any effort on this matter...</div>
