		<div id="post_14410" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey, guys! I was wondering about this just now: What would the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine, whatever you wanna call it) on one&#039;s psionic/magick/body energy arts abilities? It would probably affect them positively, as adrenaline increases one&#039;s focus.<br />
<br />
I talk about adrenaline, since its a natural reaction, but I heard about mathematicians (Paul Erdős did) and students who use stuff like amphetamines to increase their concentration, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s legal, as they&#039;re basically drugs.<br />
<br />
But have you ever experienced with enhanced focus under, say, the influence of adrenaline? I haven&#039;t, but I&#039;m really curious :P Tell your stories, theories, etc.</div>

In my theory I think that unless the psion, magician, etc. has trained their skill level to the point where it is conscious and is as easy as say moving their hand then I don&#039;t think adrenalin would really do much, it&#039;s more of a physical thing rather than mental but I do see why someone would think that because it does increase focus.<br />

There was another instance where fighting and psionics I believe play a roll. I mean physical fighting.

What i felt on my back was my associate cause i ducked so quick as he took a swing that it threw off his center of gravity. Mind you i had my complete back to him, no peripheral vision. <br />

My point is the same feeling or energy surge from the few conciously provoked visions recieved is the same from the altercation. I personaly believe there is some link and it would depend on the person and type of psychic skill set they have.</div>

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_14921">Well when you&#039;re on adrenaline, you&#039;re much more focused and pay a lot more attention to your surroundings. Psionics are based on focus, right? So since adrenaline heightens your senses, your ESP, intuition, w/e could have been heightened too.

<br />
To explain the reason why that is. We have to look at what both of these things do.<br />
<br />
Focus and relaxation (comfort) are imperative to control of energy. Focus allows you to direct the energy properly, for obvious reasons (if you don&#039;t understand why, I suppose I could explain, but I&#039;m assuming people understand.) Where as Comfort, or being relaxed, like with any use of skill (for example, welding), ensures that you aren&#039;t careless and make mistakes. (Comfort becomes more important when you are dealing with finer skills or art forms, which I would consider energy working to be, much more than many other skills.)<br />
<br />
As for Adrenaline and/or Endorphins, they don&#039;t by themselves effect energy working in the least. However, These little chemicals tend to raise emotions. Not just weak emotions either, very strong, powerful ones. As many people will tell you, strong emotions tend to raise your energy production. The sacrifice you face, is that these emotions can cloud your focus or judgment.<br />
