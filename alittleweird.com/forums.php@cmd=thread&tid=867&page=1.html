<br />
There&#039;s this... dark... afterimage following my movements. You know when you move your hand real fast, you can see a blurred afterimage behind it? To day I noticed a shadow-like one. It moves differently from the afterimage, which is still there; like it starts moving after I do, as if it was somehow trying to imitate my movements. Sometimes, out of the corner of my eye, I can see it moving on its own, without following me, mostly around my hands, like when I type. I&#039;m seeing it as I type this out.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I was walking in the mall. It was mostly empty because it was late and only a few shops were still open, like the dentist (I had an appointment, I&#039;m not enough of a psycho to walk around the mall at night... yet.) I passed by a mirror and when I saw my reflection, I looked at it straight in the eye and it was as if I looked at another person. It didn&#039;t... feel like my own reflection. I was shocked to say the least.<br />
<br />
Anyway, so now there&#039;s this weird dark... me...? following my movements and I can feel a presence... There&#039;s also something with my reflection.<br />
<br />
The best way I could describe this shadow would be a dark aura I think.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows what this is or thinks they can help find out, I&#039;d appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
<strong>I copied that from a thread I made on another forum. They deal more with magick and demonology over there, so I thought I&#039;d ask here too so I can get an idea from another perspective.<br />
<br />
Strangely, I&#039;ve been having a Tulpa talk on that forum at the same time as the one in the Q&amp;A thread here and some there suggested that this might be it, unconsciously making a Tulpa or something... I don&#039;t know... Some suggested maybe a Shadow Person latched on to me or maybe an interdimentional crossover.<br />

According to one of the guys from there, sometimes Shadow People can be curious. They can start spying on people, but usually you won&#039;t see them; they just peek around corners. If you actually spot it, it&#039;ll run off. Sometimes, a Shadow Person can start following a specific person. It doesn&#039;t really explain the mirror thing, though, unless... It wasn&#039;t my reflection that felt strange, but something in the reflected image? Like when you look at a creepy picture, but can&#039;t tell what&#039;s wrong with it until you spot that face peeking out the window?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I took a walk outside just now. I am 100% sure I could feel that same presence, but much, much more than before. (Maybe because it&#039;s dark outside this time, the shadow aura or whatever it is only seems to appear at night) At some point, I could&#039;ve sworn there was something I couldn&#039;t see hiding behind a specific tree. The feeling stayed there until I was a long way from that tree.</div>

I&#039;ve been trying to improve in energy manipulation partly just to make regular constructs and also to shield. I&#039;ve never shielded before and I haven&#039;t even done any energy manipulation yet. I was going to start training in that this weekend. Seems I&#039;ll have to double the effort and get to it ASAP.

Hmmm I got a theory from that other community.<br />
<br />
According to one of the guys from there, sometimes Shadow People can be curious. They can start spying on people, but usually you won&#039;t see them; they just peek around corners. If you actually spot it, it&#039;ll run off. Sometimes, a Shadow Person can start following a specific person. It doesn&#039;t really explain the mirror thing, though, unless... It wasn&#039;t my reflection that felt strange, but something in the reflected image? Like when you look at a creepy picture, but can&#039;t tell what&#039;s wrong with it until you spot that face peeking out the window?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I took a walk outside just now. I am 100% sure I could feel that same presence, but much, much more than before. (Maybe because it&#039;s dark outside this time, the shadow aura or whatever it is only seems to appear at night) At some point, I could&#039;ve sworn there was something I couldn&#039;t see hiding behind a specific tree. The feeling stayed there until I was a long way from that tree.</div>Could it possibly be your senses becoming extra sensitive (other than eye sight of course) because it is darker out? When your eyes are focused for the darkness your pupils dilate to bring more light into them, and to better detect movement (you got to love the rods in your eye). Maybe it was your mind playing tricks on you.<br />
<br />
If you want you could try communicating to the &quot;Shadow person&quot; by talking to it or telepathy, the worse that can happen as it is just a trick of your mind, which believe me I have been there. One time I was camping and thought I saw a ghost, so I naturally decided to try talking to it for an hour and a half. It turns out that I was talking to a backpack. XD</div>

<br />
As I said earlier, one thing&#039;s for sure: Shadow People are starting to be seen, some think intentionally, more and more often. Or at least, the reports are increasing, maybe because of the ease of communication that we now have because of the Internet.<br />
<br />
Here are a few theories as to what they could be:<br />
<br />
Some think they are ghosts. I&#039;m not sure if I like that one; ghosts don&#039;t usually appear as pure darkness, they are more like a vaporous white form with often distinctive features, while a Shadow Person doesn&#039;t seem to have features at all.<br />
<br />
Others think they might be demons, but if so, why wouldn&#039;t they act like regular demons? Why let themselves be seen like that?<br />
<br />
Another theory suggests they are indeed interdimensional beings that have managed to cross over, if only slightly and briefly, to our dimension. This could eb explained using quantum physics, as it suggests that at the base of all things in the universe is vibrations and some are beginning to think lernate universes are &quot;emitted&quot; on a different vibration frequency, kind of like a radio signal. Some think our dimension&#039;s vibrations could slowly be merging with theirs and that is why we are seeing them more often.<br />
<br />
Another one is about tie travel. Some think they are people from the future who haven&#039;t yet been able to fully appear in a physical form and can only observe from their shadowy form.<br />
<br />
Another theory suggests they could be people having OBEs. Some have theorized that everybody goes OOB when they sleep and only a few remain conscious during that OBE or at least, remember it. Those two go hand in hand very well, but the descriptions of our ethereal bodies during OBEs don&#039;t really fit the Shadow People description.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it for now, I&#039;ll try to find more. Any help is still appreciated, let&#039;s remember we don&#039;t want to single out Shadow People just yet, this could very well be something else. Please don&#039;t stray too far from the topic, though, I really don&#039;t think my reflection or the world&#039;s, the ambient light bouncing off a polished surface, could begin defying every law of optical physics and create a haunting. I did say there was something with my reflection, but I had been feeling a presence for hours, which might explain the weird feeling I got from looking at the mirror.</div>

Suppose I&#039;m sitting in my room reading a book and I suddenly feel I something through the corner of my eye and look up and I [i]see[/i] something move away in a blur from the door.When I go out into the other room there&#039;s nothing there.

There have even been times when I have seen multiples of these things together or one disappearing and another appearing and such like.

I have tried communicating but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve been successful.

@ Kube - I agree with [blue]sh[/blue] and [blue]f3licks[/blue] : shield if you feel uneasy in it&#039;s presence.
Also check if you can make it appear or disappear.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

As of, thinking ya out of the room and not moving, making them think they are in the room as they go to where they came from. Or, thinking ya not out of the room and observing that ya aren&#039;t and not moving, to make them think they aren&#039;t in the room and moving to leave the room. The theory is that ya can think to them and get a response, as they can think to ya to elicit a response. So these shadow people are likely to respond, if they are reverse as ya aren&#039;t responding. So what is the idea that this will work? Try it to find out if I say the truth.</div>
