Do you generally agree with the school of thought that there are two types of empaths, those that feel it and those that know? What is it like for you? Do you find it useful? or do you find it difficult? Has it ever helped you in situations that arise? Do you think it is a form of telepathy?(I have read that some people do.)

		<div id="post_9401" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It is hard to really define the actual line that is between empathy and telepathy. Any psychic interaction between to people isn&#039;t always clear cut. <br />
<br />
A problem that many people have is they define &quot;telepathy&quot; as &quot;Hearing someones thoughts.&quot; Which isn&#039;t entirely correct. The better definition of telepathy, (my reference is www.m-w.com ) is:<br />
<br />
Telepathy: communication from one mind to another by extrasensory means <br />
<br />
If you use that definition you are not limiting yourself to simply &#039;emotion&#039;; or even just &#039;verbal thought&#039;. You are encompassing ALL interactions between another persons mind to your own. This can include, in my eyes, the transmissions of thoughts/emotions/physical sensation/dreams and what have you. Maybe it should be called telempathy :-P<br />
<br />
Empaths who feel vs. ones who just know... I believe it really depends on the person. So, I&#039;d say yes there are &#039;two types&#039;. However, at any given moment someone can be either type. It&#039;s not something set in stone. I myself fluctuate on how I perceive another persons emotional state from &#039;just knowing&#039;, to actively feeling.<br />
<br />
It is a useful ability and if applied right you can develop very strong relationships with people based on your intuitive knowledge of how they are feeling. Just about every girl I&#039;ve had a significant relationship has told me, &quot; You know me so well, how I&#039;m feeling, what I&#039;m thinking. I don&#039;t know how you do it. &quot; This is direct application of psychic perception and my general good nature/intuitive intelligence.<br />
<br />
The most important thing someone who wants to develop a sense of emotions for someone else should understand is that you must be able to discern your own emotional state before you start trying to listen in on someone elses. If you do not it is easy to confuse the source and be in doubt. Another important thing you need to understand is how to APPLY what you know about how someone else feels to either help them, persuade them, calm them down, or to just get the most out of knowing what you know.<br />

<br />
Learning to handle emapthy is really something. See, Sheepking, you talk about people who want to develop it, well, there are people to whom it comes naturally, that have no clue about it at all. It sucks, especially when you feel emotions and don&#039;t just know them. Confusing the source is very simple to do and if you are unaware that it even exist, it is automatically assumed that it is yourself. Learning to control it when you don&#039;t want it or try it is something rather important. There are probably a lot more people out there who are thinking they are just nut cases that are actually empathetic than you think. It is extremely aggravating.<br />
<br />
I do think that there are people that are more/less sensitive to others though. Does anyone have thoughts on that?</div>

<br />
I can use my empathetic skill, and &quot;extend&quot; it in a sense, to cover telepathy.  Or I can just use telepathy straight up.<br />
<br />
I suppose my distinction originates in my belief that emotions ORIGINATE from the heart.  I know that a lot of people think that emotions are chemicals in your brain... but I don&#039;t really buy that :-P.  I&#039;m sure the chemicals in your brain are related to your emotions (of course)!  But I don&#039;t think emotions ORIGINATE from the brain.<br />
<br />
However, I think that thoughts originate from the brain (as do most people, I think :-P).<br />
<br />
So, in my belief structure, communicating emotions is done by the heart.  It can be done with the brain, but it&#039;s harder, and less &quot;pure&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for those who feel anothers emotions, and those that &quot;just know&quot; - is there really that definite of a distinction between empaths?  I&#039;ve never known there to be two categories of empaths in that regard.  I&#039;ve always thought everyone felt the emotions, and you can &quot;just know&quot; because you are feeling them, and you know what you&#039;re feeling :-P.  If that makes sense :-P.<br />

<br />
When we see people do things that we normally do when we feel a certain way, we might begin to think that they are feeling that way too.  Most of the time, we are right, because people are people, and people usually have certain ways they go about expressing themselves.<br />
That is not empathy.<br />
That is, actually, a very closed minded way to interpret people&#039;s emotions, because we are assuming that everyone else expresses themselves the same way as we do.  Not a very &quot;out of the box&quot; perspective.<br />
Empathy IS a very &quot;out of the box&quot; perception.<br />
<br />
E.g. If we see someone tearing, sniffing their nose with their cheeks turning red, we might assume someone is sad, because we might do that when we are sad, however they might just be cutting onions, or they might have allergies.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I believe people can successfully perform empathy.  However, I&#039;d prefer to see empathy happen while someone is blindfolded, with their ears plugged and with someone they don&#039;t know.  It CAN happen.  Just people aren&#039;t always doing it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I realize saying this might sound discouraging or skeptical, but I do believe in Empathy 100%, I just don&#039;t believe that what everyone is calling empathy is empathy.  <br />
Don&#039;t call a kick a punch just because it hurt the same.</div>

		<div id="post_9461" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">ryan, I really liked what you had to say. It is true. There are a lot of people who probably only notice, but call it empathy. It&#039;s kind of one of those things where if someone claims to be, you want to examine their claim because it could be false. It is something that anyone can be, but some are more naturally inclined to.<br />
<br />
I would love to try your experiment, it appeals to me, so thanks for the idea(now I just have to find a way to enact it...)<br />
<br />
A lot of people jump to conclusions, about everything, but, I think that someone who is truly naturally empathetic knows it. You can not deny feeling emotions that are not your own, especially once you know where they are coming from and seperate them from yourself, you can&#039;t deny it(It will drive you mad until you figure it out though, very overwhelming and if you are natuarally empathetic and don&#039;t understand it, it is awful.)</div>

I do not understands the mechanics of what really makes someone more sensitive, or even sensitive to psi, very well. Does it have to do with an enlarged energy field, good relations with the subconscious mind, being at the right &#039;frequency&#039;?<br />
<br />
But what I do know is that most people I have encountered have varying degrees of sensitivity, and every person has their own &#039;range&#039;. So, I&#039;m going to stab at it and say &quot;Yes&quot; some people are more sensitive than others. However, if you have a wider range of sensitivity, at times you may be less sensitive than others at the &quot;same time&quot;. Get my drift?<br />
<br />
And to sean about distinctions between those empaths who feel vs. just know... I suppose it seems to me like it would be the distinction between receiving a thought as a concept or actually hearing the exact words. Though one form is more common than the other, they are both possible. I do not believe there is a definite line between the two, and that the majority of empaths know because they are directly feeling, rather than knowing without feeling.<br />
<br />
to Ryan: Aside from &#039;testing&#039; empathy, it would be immensely impractical to have to blind fold yourself, plug your ears, and grab a random stranger every time you want to practice empathy. I believe that psychic empathy is much more common than you allow yourself to acknowledge.<br />

And to what Sean said about the distinctions, it is not so much that there is a solid line, it is what people naturally lean towards(and I guess it has a lot to do with shielding and blocking people out). The difference is that if you just know them, or have learned to control it enough, it is actually very different than feeling them. I think that a lot of it has to do with control. I never &quot;just know,&quot; I always feel, to the point where I lose how I was feeling, like the, Why am I so angry? I have nothing to be angry about. Then realizing that it actually isn&#039;t me, but that underneath the smile the person I am with is feeling that. I think it has a lot to do with shielding and being able to control it.<br />

Also in regards to the ambulance, I&#039;m not to sure if you would feel pain... pain is not really an emotion (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, I&#039;m not very skilled in empathy I&#039;m just stating my thoughts.) but a reaction from nerves spread throughout your body. I imagine you would be more likely to collapse from an emotion such as extreme sadness or such a thing. Say if you picked up on the feelings of a large group of people from a disaster zone.</div>

Are you suggesting you&#039;ve felt that?</div>yes  I am, but I dont understand what it was but I dont think it was my emotion. After research on psipog I read that you feel empathy more in your heart and less in your mind, after read the article I came to the conclusion (note: I am open for suggestions) what I felt was empathy. It wasn&#039;t a pleasent experience, I also felt drained. It stop once the ambulance left and I sort &quot;knew&quot; something was going to happen through precog but I ignored it (big mistake). It wasn&#039;t like normal pain, it was well ...odd. So I thought I ask if anyone has had a similar experience. <br />
