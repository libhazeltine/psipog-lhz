Healing comes in many different forms =P.<br />
<br />
Psi isn&#039;t the only form of energy you come across either for healing. One other common form is Reiki healing.<br />
<br />
What I was mentioning to Joke was about how Auras relate to healing. For example, I often see a white spot where there is disease or injury to a person.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I also mentioned that an advanced healing method talked about (I believe it was at psipog but it may have been somewhere else) involves the aura color and it&#039;s opposite.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t say she was a healer because her aura was green. I said that green is a common sign of healing in a persons aura. Either emotionally or physically. She was healing, not necessarily a healer, that is the difference. =P<br />
<br />
As for other forms, they oft follow completely different examples than the healing methods common to psi.<br />
<br />
Reiki practitioners often just pour the reiki energy into you and allow it to flow (from experience, it feels like a warm shower that flows into you and corrects things, it&#039;s almost sentient). Advanced reiki practitioners are the only one&#039;s who guide this energy and only to a limited extent. Anyway, I think that&#039;s enough babbling from me =P.</div>That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much for clearing that up! ^.^<br />
<br />
...So....I&#039;d say I&#039;m really not that much of a healer, just to be on the safe side.<br />

I guess the healing intent itself is already a program for the psi you&#039;re sending. It could happen that you spontaneously start visualizing the healing.<br />
<br />
But yeah, you could:<br />
1. imagine your psi aligning the flow of psi in the patient&#039;s body.<br />
2. just replace their old energy with some new.<br />
3. visualize parts of his / her body regenerating (needs more control than the other two).<br />

Joke</div>There is something you could start with that is a really powerfull technique and you can learn it within about an hour.<br />
It&#039;s called Quantum Touch, there&#039;s several books about it. The basic one is this one:  <a href="http://books.google.at/books?id=3PloAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=quantum+touch" target="_blank">http://books.google.at/books?id=3PloAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=quantum+touch</a><br />

<br />
Auras, and the visible and subjective manifestation there of, auric-sight or aura-vision can not always be a tell-tale. You see auras and their color, and more importantly the meaning behind their color, is all based on the manifester. Where one may see a color such as, lets say blue as calming another may find it as a saddening. Now as for my own personal experience I cannot elaborate lengthily upon the sight of auras, but rather on their feelings. You see auras are not limited to color and sight, they can be interpreted as feelings that dwell in the lower upper-middle chest, and come in quite a plethora of feelings. Sight is subjective, feelings are too, but inner meanings are not. Just keep that in mind if you pursue studies in auric-sight. Though what is more important to keep in mind is that this is just one view from one person whose experiences have yet to be proven in the eyes of this community. Ultimately, just like all things in life, you must decide what is right for you.<br />

As for healing there is a good supply of information on PsiPog, but here is a term that many, especially those starting out, found distasteful. What is that saying? &quot;Just do it.&quot; Aggravating, yes, but true. Have intention and pose it quietly, unheard to your mind. You must both know the intent, but not think it. Muddle not your mind with the swarming thoughts of what and how, but just do. Healing, however, requires a focus, visualization to the area and problem. And while there are many paths to healing and not all are made for every person the author Annie was correct to state the following, that empathy and healing do go hand-in-hand. The better you can feel their pain so too can you better alleviate it, link with them and it. Empathy, a term coined for feeling one&#039;s emotion is much more. Emotions are but the mouth of a long and intertwining catacomb.<br />

Auras, and the visible and subjective manifestation there of, auric-sight or aura-vision can not always be a tell-tale. You see auras and their color, and more importantly the meaning behind their color, is all based on the manifester. Where one may see a color such as, lets say blue as calming another may find it as a saddening. Now as for my own personal experience I cannot elaborate lengthily upon the sight of auras, but rather on their feelings. You see auras are not limited to color and sight, they can be interpreted as feelings that dwell in the lower upper-middle chest, and come in quite a plethora of feelings. Sight is subjective, feelings are too, but inner meanings are not. Just keep that in mind if you pursue studies in auric-sight. Though what is more important to keep in mind is that this is just one view from one person whose experiences have yet to be proven in the eyes of this community. Ultimately, just like all things in life, you must decide what is right for you.

Though I was brought about learning the terms sprinkled about in the communities I often felt that there is so much more than what was portrayed. Auras to me embody all that is the person, their essence. And being much akin to the varying levels of sensing energies so can you sense another. The most relative notion is the Psi-Ball.<br />
<br />
Our mundane practice ball has no one set way of being felt. Some may feel a tactile response such as heat or cold, others may feel a tingle to their hands, some may feel an attraction or repulsion of their hands, the ever fabled &quot;flared&quot; and visible psi-ball, and some can even feel it as if an extension of themselves, an expanded awareness outside of the body to a lighter sense. I digress. The aura can be felt in the same way. I would imagine it falls down to the preference or natural affinity of the user to whatever form of response best suits them. So while I do agree with your Akio that an aura entails all of that I would not be one to say that they must all be felt simultaneously to get the full brunt of information. Each response can tell its own story if only we pay close enough attention to the fluctuations and break them down as compared to instinct and experience.<br />
<br />
However, keep in my my words are not an end all and if anything this field is defined by the word &quot;subjective.&quot; It will always be a little different for each of us in some way, after all.</div>

I found that if I visualize some psi-pipes / channels / wires somewhere in the area where the pain is and isolate them from each-other, the pain goes away or weakens at least. The hard part however, is to locate the actual problematic channels that need to be isolated - it has taken from first successful try up to even a few minutes.

It&#039;s not an usual injury, because just aligning the flow of psi or just refreshing the energy in the area do nothing.

With that said, I&#039;ve come to a realization and could be perceived as healing, but it actually isn&#039;t. Aside from real bad injuries, the easiest way to get better is make you body thing it is working on getting better. Its the mind over matter trick.<br />

Just a theory, though. As far as I know, it only works half the time when I try it.<br />

I am a healer. I have been for many years. I believe that there is one energy - Reiki, Psi, Chi, Ki, Qi, Prana, Mana --- It&#039;s all the same in my mind. I am a Reiki Master which means I am a certified teacher in the healing art of Reiki. If you (or anyone else here) would like more information on Reiki, healing or anything - Or if you would like to talk about why you feel it might be a sin (My father is a pastor of a christian baptist church) I think that I could help you sort some stuff out. I will check these forums when I can, but the easiest way to reach me is by email - <a href="mailto:MatthiasWatchman@gmail.com">MatthiasWatchman@gmail.com</a><br />
