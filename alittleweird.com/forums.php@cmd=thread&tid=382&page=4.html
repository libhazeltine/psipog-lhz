I would have to agree with you on the fact that our egos would shatter if life didn&#039;t need a meaning.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I think the reason I&#039;m so intent on finding the meaning of my life is to prove my life has a meaning. If I didn&#039;t, I would sooner or later jump of a bridge from the countless insults and putdowns from myself. Can anyone else relate to what I&#039;m explaining?<br />
<br />
@Wandering wolf<br />
I know I just repeated your words. I was just trying to expand the idea. I don&#039;t really have an explanation.<br />
<br />
...Wait I figured it out! The meaning of life! And I&#039;m not joking on this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning of life gives us a context against which to measure our &quot;correctness&quot; in relation to others. We know that we are good persons if we accomplish our &quot;purpose&quot; in life. This purpose being dictated by dominant culture and religious viewpoints.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you look back at what Antisankari wrote, it becomes clearer.<br />
<br />
The meaning of life is to fullfill your one true life purpose. To fullfill exactly what you want out of life. If you look at a rapist-murderer, is his/her one true life purpose to really kill or rape?<br />
<br />
&quot;If you asked me while I was meditating I would probably ask you why life &quot;needs&quot; to have meaning in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can explain this as well. When people meditate, they forget  their worries and just relax. You can&#039;t fullfill your life purpose if you don&#039;t worry about it, even just a little. That is why if you asked Wandering wolf what the meaning of life was while he was meditating, he would ask why life needed a meaning. He didn&#039;t have any worries at the time, so he had either forgotten about his life purpose for the moment or he just wasn&#039;t worried at that time.<br />
<br />
...Um...I hope you guys can get what I&#039;m talking about.<br />

I would have to agree with you on the fact that our egos would shatter if life didn&#039;t need a meaning.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I think the reason I&#039;m so intent on finding the meaning of my life is to prove my life has a meaning. If I didn&#039;t, I would sooner or later jump of a bridge from the countless insults and putdowns from myself. Can anyone else relate to what I&#039;m explaining?<br />

@Wandering wolf<br />
I know I just repeated your words. I was just trying to expand the idea. I don&#039;t really have an explanation.<br />
<br />
...Wait I figured it out! The meaning of life! And I&#039;m not joking on this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning of life gives us a context against which to measure our &quot;correctness&quot; in relation to others. We know that we are good persons if we accomplish our &quot;purpose&quot; in life. This purpose being dictated by dominant culture and religious viewpoints.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you look back at what Antisankari wrote, it becomes clearer.<br />
<br />
The meaning of life is to fullfill your one true life purpose. To fullfill exactly what you want out of life. If you look at a rapist-murderer, is his/her one true l;ife purpose to really kill or rape?<br />
<br />
&quot;If you asked me while I was meditating I would probably ask you why life &quot;needs&quot; to have meaning in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can explain this as well. When people meditate, they forget their worries and just relax. You can&#039;t fullfill your life purpose if you don&#039;t worry about it, even just a little.

You make an interesting point, but I&#039;m afraid that this...<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">When people meditate, they forget their worries and just relax. You can&#039;t fullfill your life purpose if you don&#039;t worry about it, even just a little.</div>...is where the line is drawn that separates our beliefs.<br />
<br />
I believe that meditating dissolves the illusion of having a meaning for one&#039;s life. Nothing is forgotten: All is merely realized and made clearer. Without an ego which desires and judges, the objective truth can be realized. The ego is said to be the cause of all desire and therefore the ego is that which causes us to search for a meaning in our lives. Without desire there is freedom, which also translates into the freedom from having a meaning to one&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
Also...<br />

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">I would have to agree with you on the fact that our egos would shatter if life didn&#039;t need a meaning.</div>I see. This adequately explains why you believe what you believe. Ironically, &quot;shattering&quot; one&#039;s ego is more or less the goal of every Buddhist. It is believed to be the only way to obtain true freedom...even the freedom from &quot;needing&quot; a meaning to one&#039;s life. Do you not see that &quot;needing&quot; a meaning for your life binds you to it and supresses your very freedom? <br />
<br />
There is a reason why meditation eliminates our worries. It does this because we are experiencing true freedom from all of the false obligations that we create for ourselves. <br />
<br />
It is the metaphorical equivalent of ceasing to clean your house or apartment because you no longer care about what your guests think of its cleanliness. The freedom from caring what people think about you can also set you free and allow you to do what you truly feel like doing. However, it is very difficult to distinguish between free will and the will of one&#039;s ego because of the ego&#039;s firm and almost constant grasp over our actions, thoughts, emotions, and psyche in general.<br />
<br />
Well, this is all what I have come to believe anyway. I will not be upset if you simply cannot agree with me. I will respect your right to believe what you want to believe if you will respect my own. This is all I have to say for now. Unless you want to discuss something slightly different that we may be able to at least compromise on, then I suggest that we discuss this no further.</div>

Quite honestly,I don&#039;t think there is such a thing as intuition. It is, to an extent, what you have discribed, but I think it goes deeper then that. <br />
<br />
I think that intuition is false because it isn&#039;t pure. It&#039;s just one of the terms we use to discribe events that are much more complicated then what we would like to admit. For example, rather than psychic intuition that would cause The sniper in your example to make the shot, It was much more likely to be a multitude of other things that caused him to fire. He may have had a feeling in his trigger finger telling him to fire, and that along with his experience in the battlefield and his knowledge of the situation that he felt it right to fire at the moment he did. <br />
<br />
I think the thing I&#039;m trying to get across is there are no simple explainations, there are simple answers, and simple people, but no simple explainations.</div>

If we determine our purpose in life how can a person dictate to another what his or her true purpose in life is? If a murdering rappist tells himself that the meaning for his existance is to rape and then kill (or even more disturbing kill and then rape) how can we tell him any different? Obviously taking a life is wrong the majority of society can agree on that, but once we get into what we/society agrees with on a whole we start to lose the fact that a person&#039;s destiny is in his/her own hands, and becomes something that is decided for the person. In his case we leave the realm of life not having a purpose or deciding your own purpose and enter into something along the lines of destiny&#039;s that are preordained. I for one would much rather believe that life has no real purpose because this line of thinking doesn&#039;t hurt my head =P</div>

If our purpose was to woship God, wouldn&#039;t that make God a pretty narcisist and arrogant guy? :) If God created us so we would worship him I think God has some serious self-esteem problems (note that I&#039;m saying this in an ironic way, I mean no disrespect for anyone&#039;s religious views).<br />
<br />
Well death is certainly certain. But saying hell and paradise are certain is in my opinion a bit intolerant. I believe they could very possibly be real (I&#039;m not a fan of the idea thou), but I wouldn&#039;t say anything religious is certain.<br />
<br />
I guess you could say this life is a test if you believe in paraside and hell. If a single lifetime would send you to eternal damnation or eternal joy, I would say anyone who&#039;s not using their whole time and energy into passing this test is a morron.</div>
