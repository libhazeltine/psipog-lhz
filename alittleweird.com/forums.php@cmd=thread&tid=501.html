I sometimes get the feeling some people use the forum to &quot;role play&quot; or to look for attention rather than to talk about this issues in a more serious way.<br />
<br />
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong, I think it&#039;s very important to keep an open mind, specially with things like psionics, and it&#039;s good to have fun, you can&#039;t take everything people say seriously. But I think things like this is what makes most people laugh at the idea of psionics.<br />
<br />
I also get the feeling that sometimes, some people talk about a subject like they know about it first hand, like they know all about it when in reality there&#039;s really no way of knowing much about that subject. I think it&#039;s good to share experiences, and it&#039;s good to share theories, but talking in this way might seem arrogant, ignorant and close minded.<br />

I think most of the times you have to give people the benefit of the doubt, but as Amaroq said, its good to keep a healthy level of skepticism.<br />
People could actually be doing what they claim to do, but if you heard an athlete claim he can make a 4 meters (13 feet) high jump without anything to back it up besides his own word what would you think about that? It might be possible for the human body to do that kind of jump, but it&#039;s also very unlikely someone can do it.<br />

And as I said I&#039;m not looking for a way to stop this, the solution for me is just to keep an open mind and to ignore posts that I believe are BS. I&#039;m just interested in what people think about this.</div>

		<div id="post_10674" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The problem you mention in your original post is something that really gets on my nerves.<br />
<br />
I believe the issue exists because - even though psionics is real - a lot of the stuff we use to measure psionics is pseudo-science.  I don&#039;t mean that in the derogatory sense, I mean it in the literal sense.<br />
<br />
Psionics is very hard to study scientifically, according to the scientific method.  How can we measure if you&#039;re correctly making a construct or not?  How can we measure if your dream was really predicting the future?  How can we measure the validity of the emotions you feel from your neighbor?<br />
<br />
These things are very hard to measure scientifically.  Even with knowledge that these things are real, that still doesn&#039;t solve the problem of measurement.<br />
<br />
So... as a result... some people see this problem of measurement, and try their best to do what they can.  Other people don&#039;t see this problem, and just think psionics is &quot;whatever you want it to be&quot;.  Want to create a shield that opens a non-existant energy portal in your left ear?  Sure!  Go ahead!  No one can deny you anyways.<br />
<br />
The solution is to find ways of scientifically measuring psionics.  The geiger counter is a great start, but there&#039;s so much more to go.  Only objective measurement can distinguish between the loonies and the legends.  If we stay in the realm of pseudo-science, then we&#039;ll never be able to distinguish between those rooted in reality, and those in fantasy land.<br />
