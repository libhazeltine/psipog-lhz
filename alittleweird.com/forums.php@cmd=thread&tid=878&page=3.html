I see how motivation is important, but giving someone a smiley-face sticker every time they do well doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll do their best every time just for the sticker.  But then again maybe they will, heh.   A wall of achievements could breed bragging rights, a feeling of completion, or progress.

The problem with finding someone who has a website is that most of the time they want to do things their way.   Admin think they&#039;re gods, and they kinda are.   Sure, some of them are sober enough to be level-headed, but the feeling of control effects everyone differently.    We&#039;d need to have a group of people on even ground, so that nobody gets the idea they&#039;re better than anyone else, or that their idea is the right one.<br />

Agreed, although I&#039;d prefer if we told everyone from the outset to remain subjective, and see everything with an open mind and grain of salt.<br />

Most experiments can&#039;t be proven or taken into account, even if the person is well trusted.  We should allow experiments, but not reward them.  We should also tell people that these are personal experiences, and as always, take it with a grain of salt.</div>

I can make a few micro PK games, and the all famous Zener cards.<br />
Neat little achievements included.<br />
<br />
(2)<br />
Kube has a point.  to my knowledge- no one thats ever started a psionic forum or website has ever started anything as complex as a schooling system.   Mainly for having no time or interest, or wanting people to help themselves instead of being babysat.<br />
Its mostly been about finding like-minded people, not growing or developing.<br />
<br />
(3) &amp; (4)<br />
Publishing a students article or experiment could be among the achievements of learning..  And especially helpful when first starting out, because we&#039;ll have many possible candidates for a good article, rather than one or two willing contributers.<br />
It&#039;ll teach them how to collect information, condense it to a readable format, and the importance of pitching in to a community that needs support.<br />
<br />
(5)<br />
Who is willing to take the reigns of this project and see it through to completion?<br />
There are only so many people left with the balls of brass to actually put the work in.<br />
So I suggest a vote of any willing candidates, we pick the three to five most willing people to lead the project, based on their willingness to help, their psionic knowledge, and their skill in teaching.<br />
<br />
If after we find the people that will be willing to lead, and there are more than five or so, we&#039;ll have everybody take a vote, and we&#039;ll narrow it down to the most respected or talented psions, the best of the willing, to lead the teaching and structure of the psionic school.<br />
<br />
The chances of this working out are iffy, but if we choose the right group of people, the chances of it succeeding will greatly improve.<br />
<br />
<br />
To start this show off, I&#039;ll nominate myself and Tricky.<br />
<br />
I have the balls to see this show &#039;till the end, and I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m a natural leader.<br />
Tricky on the other hand has a lot of knowledge and skill with psionics, and he brought this topic up, which shows his concern with the well being of the community.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mean to put you on the spot Tricky, and you can back out at any time, but you seem the most fired up about this.<br />

I can make a few micro PK games, and the all famous Zener cards.
Neat little achievements included.

(2)
Kube has a point.  to my knowledge- no one thats ever started a psionic forum or website has ever started anything as complex as a schooling system.   Mainly for having no time or interest, or wanting people to help themselves instead of being babysat.
Its mostly been about finding like-minded people, not growing or developing.

(3) &amp; (4)
Publishing a students article or experiment could be among the achievements of learning..  And especially helpful when first starting out, because we&#039;ll have many possible candidates for a good article, rather than one or two willing contributers.
It&#039;ll teach them how to collect information, condense it to a readable format, and the importance of pitching in to a community that needs support.

(5)
Who is willing to take the reigns of this project and see it through to completion?
There are only so many people left with the balls of brass to actually put the work in.
So I suggest a vote of any willing candidates, we pick the three to five most willing people to lead the project, based on their willingness to help, their psionic knowledge, and their skill in teaching.

If after we find the people that will be willing to lead, and there are more than five or so, we&#039;ll have everybody take a vote, and we&#039;ll narrow it down to the most respected or talented psions, the best of the willing, to lead the teaching and structure of the psionic school.

The chances of this working out are iffy, but if we choose the right group of people, the chances of it succeeding will greatly improve.


To start this show off, I&#039;ll nominate myself and Tricky.

I have the balls to see this show &#039;till the end, and I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m a natural leader.
Tricky on the other hand has a lot of knowledge and skill with psionics, and he brought this topic up, which shows his concern with the well being of the community.

I don&#039;t mean to put you on the spot Tricky, and you can back out at any time, but you seem the most fired up about this.
And I only nominated myself because as I see it, we need at least one person that&#039;ll be certain about helping.
I&#039;ll be more than willing to back down if I think someone else could do better.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, this will require everyone..  But we need some people to lead the pack and sort through the decisions and choices as their prime goal.   People who will be able to contribute the most to its completion, the success of the school, and the future success of the students that visit.

Nominate yourself, or someone else as long as they know.
We need people, so if you&#039;re sure you want to help, I say pitch in.
Thats what I&#039;m doing.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

That&#039;s right, Trick, most teachers don&#039;t always seem much better than their students... So I propose we do something like what they did on Veritas for their mentor program: We design an application form everybody agrees on and we could even add in a few miscellaneous questions to test them a bit. Veritas asks something along the lines of &quot;Why d ads for kids use birds as mascots.&quot; or something like that. Questions that at first don&#039;t seem very important but can turn out to have a deep psychological/philosophical meaning and can tell you a lot about the applicant. Maybe stuff like &quot;What is Evil?&quot; to see if they&#039;re easily influenced or if they can reason things out for themselves. (Because that&#039;s a necessary ability for a teacher.)[/quote]

I wouldn&#039;t pass..

I was thinking something more along the lines of making sure the teacher really knows what thier doing in the subject thier teaching, though. But not a bad start. </div>
