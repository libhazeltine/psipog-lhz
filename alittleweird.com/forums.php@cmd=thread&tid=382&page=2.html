		<div id="post_8498" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey everyone, this is my first post, since I can&#039;t find a designated area for it. Sorry if I missed it! *handshakes* all around and all that.<br />
<br />
Maybe a bad idea to get into the heavy stuff right off the bat, but here is my particular take on the meaning of life:<br />
<br />
I honestly have no clue. I was raised atheist, turned christian in my middle school years, and now am...agnostic-christian? I believe in a God, and believe that the morals taught in the New Testament are the &#039;correct&#039; ones, but I&#039;m not a devout catholic by any stretch of the imagination. With that all in mind, I think that the meaning of life is to balance the freedom to choose of those around, the happiness of those around you, and your own happiness, in that order. You do what you can to make other people happy, while still giving them choice to make themselves miserable if they so choose, and all the while making sure that you take at least a minimal care for yourself. As for the afterlife, preserving your soul and bringing new sheep into the flock, idk. Seems like a kind God wouldn&#039;t threaten us with hell. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t intend to start a religious flame war or anything, you people seem level-headed enough for that not to happen, I just don&#039;t think the topic at hand and my faith can be seperated.</div>

If you really know and are passionate about logic, then logic should tell you that people change and societies change and that we grow smart as we get old. So does society. You should really listen to other peoples knowledge instead of shutting them out. They would probably have more experience that you. And, as we know, humans learn by trial and error. But we may also learn by listening and paying attention, it hurts less.<br />

@Sheepking<br />
That reading was very excellent, thank you. The meaning of death is to end all of your life&#039;s work and life in itself. Mainly to rest. In some religions, the meaning of life is to enjoy a good life, but to still be good and to prepare yourself for the &quot;judgment day&quot; or so its called. Your death is like your deadline. It&#039;s not THE judgment day, but its when you have to spot preparing for it.<br />
<br />
but lets not go into that. My meaning of life right now is to finish and publish my book, go to hillsdale, at least be married by 22 or 24, have a few kids, become a writer. Have a majors in philosophy, and english and a minor is math and art.<br />
<br />
wait...is that really my meaning of life...hm...<br />

If the point of life is to pass and recieve knowledge then that still leaves the question of why we exist. Computers do a much better job of passing info then we ever could. So why don&#039;t we have a plant full of machines?<br />

I personally don&#039;t think there is a meaning to life. Humans are just another species on this planet. We just evolved to a point where we can think about complicated things...sorta like this ^_^ If we are just another species on this planet then our only job is to reproduce so that the species survives, and seeing as how there are over 6 billion people on earth I&#039;d say we&#039;re doing a pretty good job -_^</div>

You so matter-of-factly stated both the meaning of death and of your life. Though I don&#039;t disagree with both answers, I do differ in opinion on how you came to the conclusions of both.<br />
<br />
While with Death you have formed an opinion of how death affects our life. Effectively stopping it. But the meaning you attach to it, perhaps incorrectly (who knows on that), is the effect it has. You say, &quot; Death stops life. So Death is the end point where you can&#039;t continue to move forward. &quot; Well yes, but WHY Does it stop our life? Why does it exist as much as life? (the answer is not &quot;because you die&quot;.)<br />
<br />
With the meaning of your life. You aren&#039;t necessarily meant to write a book, have kids, get married, etc. Those are the things you WANT. Is there a seperation between what we WANT and what is meant to be made out of life? I hope so; Because I want something for myself every year.</div>

Well, there is a difference between what we want out of life and what is meant to be made out of life, I will agree with you at that. But because I don&#039;t know the true meaning of my life, I try to describe it by what I plan on doing in my life and what has happened in my life.<br />

Everything has an end, thats all I can explain it from. Yes, I did describe what it does instead of what it is. But, many times, if you want to find out what something is, you need to look at what it does and vise-versa<br />

I agree with you on the part of computers not being able to gain new knowledge. My use of the analogy was simply to demonstrate my lack of faith in the idea of exicting purely to send and recieve information. If that was the meaning of life then the human race would be no better than a computer. I have little to no belief in a higher purpose, so existence is merly a fact of life. Humans are charged with no more resonsibility for life than a dog, or a monkey, or yes a computer -_^<br />

I re-read what I wrote last time and I don&#039;t think I made myself crystal clear, Although I think you&#039;re boardering on understanding me ^_^ we ARE the superior species (on that topic I agree with you) thanks to seccessfully reproducing adaptive traits; reproduction of the adaptive as it were. That&#039;s why we&#039;re not drooling cavemen/women -_^ playing in caves with rocks. Thanks to these adaptive traits that have been naturally selected by nature we have the ability to think and have emotions. However the part about taking care of this world isn&#039;t really a purpose in everyones life. It is merly something that we all must do, Kinda like cleaning your room. You don&#039;t have to do it, but if you don&#039;t it because messy and uninhabitable. </div>

Actually, there could be thousands of reasons to USE Life/death, but there is only one meaning.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll use your rock for example. It has many uses, but only one meaning. What the rock is used for and what it does are usually very similar.<br />
<br />
Same thing with life. It allows to do the things we want to do, but it is sometimes used for evil (only a certain part of life, though). It also tells us that if we throw away our life (kill ourselfs or die) that we cannot use it anymore. Life (if an object) would probably be a light source/ball. When you let go of it, it is lost forever and so is your &quot;light&quot;. If we were talking religion here, this is the time where your &quot;God&quot; or savior would come save you and provide you with light.</div>

Same thing with life. It allows to do the things we want to do, but it is sometimes used for evil (only a certain part of life, though). It also tells us that if we throw away our life (kill ourselfs or die) that we cannot use it anymore. Life (if an object) would probably be a light source/ball. When you let go of it, it is lost forever and so is your &quot;light&quot;. If we were talking religion here, this is the time where your &quot;God&quot; or savior would come save you and provide you with light.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
