For Amaroq&#039;s question: from my reaserch, the quantity of energy (psi, chi, ki whatever) is an illusion. It is part of stuff... better it is the stuff that makes stuff to be stuff (something like that :P). There are even people who don&#039;t use the &quot;energy&quot;, like NI, to do psionics.

		<div id="post_10650" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">dont they say as you use psi there is a depletion of glucose? well, glucose is just energy from food. I think we just use the basic energy from food to fuel our the other thing that seems to disappear while using psi is potassium, which is important in nerve impulses, specifically (for our case) in the brain. If i were to have to guess, I would say the energy all comes from our primary source, foodstuffs. The question is what do we convert it into in order to do the crazy stuff we do... One of the things for certain is that for healing our brains expand our electro-magnetic field around the hands. A &quot;faith healer&quot; was rigged up to some equiptment when he did his thing, and it turns out he was putting out a much larger than normal electromagnetic field when he did his faith healing. And electromagnetism has been proven to help with injuries, in ways such as speeding up bone regeneration in fractures and breaks. So this guy was actually healing them faster, not with god&#039;s help, but because of a stronger electromagnetic field.<br />
Also, in case you wanted another tidbit, that is why wiccans, druids, and other magical religions use the quartz crystal as a part of healing, because it is used to magnify or direct electromagnetism, even in modern day machines :)<br />

the only real question is how one can control energy outside the body in that density with that level of precision? psi is supposed to be the unknown mechanic, but I&#039;m skeptical.

The fact that it would increase vital signs if it was dealt with the brain, as well as that it would drain vital ingredients in the blood. That happens every day from concentration alone. But the concentration is kicked in with energy manipulation above and beyond the accepted norm.<br />

<br />
To explain, at least a little bit..<br />
<br />
There are two primary forces inside every atom, the Nuclear force, and the Electromagnetic force.

This also causes repulsion between like charges. <br />
<br />
Now you may be asking, &quot;wouldn&#039;t the nucleus blast apart because of the electromagnetic force?&quot; Well... without the nuclear force, that would be the case. The Nuclear force is very powerful, but only works a very short distance. Meaning that it&#039;s powerful enough to hold the nucleus of the atom together, but not at a great distance.<br />
<br />
Now... if you split an atom, it has been observed *cough*Hiroshima*cough* that it will cause a very powerful explosion... but how does one do that?<br />
 <br />
One method is by increasing the number and effectively the size of the nucleus. After it hits a particular size, the nuclear force will not be able to sustain the atom and it will blast apart into several smaller atoms (which, if they are unstable, will also blast apart, repeating the process until a stable state is reached).<br />
