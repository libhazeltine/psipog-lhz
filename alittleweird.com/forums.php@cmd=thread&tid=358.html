I believe that they would impart to us a different religious/philosophical view that would make most of us question our own basic beliefs. It would probably rip most people a new one...maybe two new ones. I think I&#039;d trust an alien more than I&#039;d trust a human anyway, so they might just be able to convince me that their beliefs are vaild if they wanted to (^_^).</div>

If you&#039;ve ever been to a really fluffy/&quot;out there&quot; site like wingmakers, you may have read about how some people believe that there are different kinds of aliens with different characteristics. The most common type mentioned are called &quot;greys&quot;. These are the stereotypical type of aliens portrayed in most films and TV series (i.e. the X Files).<br />
<br />
They claim that the greys just like to study humans. If this is all true, then they probably wouldn&#039;t have a whole lot in common with us and we would probably be looked down upon as a mildly interesting, but &quot;inferior society&quot;, much like how we regard ants, primates, etc.<br />

It is funny to think about how puzzled they would be to see how corruptible and disorderly most of us humans are. This is all just food for thought really.</div>
