<br />
What is Shared Dreaming or Dreamwalking?<br />
<br />
Shared dreaming is when you and at least one other person have the same dream, but not only coincidently have the same dream, they are in the same dream and they could talk about anything they want and the other person should know if the dream memory is not to bad.<br />
Dreamwalking is easy said if you &quot;walk&quot; into anotherones dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can we conciously &quot;walk&quot; into anotherones dream?<br />
<br />
Lucid dreaming is the answer. It is when you know that you are dreaming. I think most of you already heard that. For everybody who is new to that stuff, here&#039;s a little link: <a href="http://www.dreamviews.com/community/index.php" target="_blank" title="http://www.dreamviews.com/community/index.php">http://www.dreamviews.com/community/index.php</a><br />
<br />
How do we test Shared Dreaming?<br />
<br />
We&#039;re looking for  location to meet in our dreams. It should be easy to meet as long as we know where to meet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay here we go:<br />
<br />
Location: Lucid Crossroads (<a href="http://lucidcrossroads.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://lucidcrossroads.co.uk/index.html">http://lucidcrossroads.co.uk/index.html</a>)<br />
Time: Noon (only noon in your dreams, you don&#039;t have to go to sleep at noon^^, its just for trying if time matters)<br />
<br />
What to do when you&#039;re there?<br />
<br />
Look around for any other dreamers or anything eyecatching, if there is nothing, then create something eyecatching, maybe someone else sees it. For example cast a huge fireball in the sky.<br />
<br />
What to do when I meet someone?<br />
<br />
Ask them for their screennames and then just talk about something, then as soon as you wake up write down what you talked and then post your experience without telling the screenname or anything specific and wait for the right person to react. Since there is no PM System here, we can only stick to that<br />
<br />
If I can think of anything else, I will add it.</div>

With the waking I have a tip for you. First one, most obvious one -&gt; The more often you have a lucid the longer it will last. Now the real hint -&gt; when you think you are waking up, then you can rub your hands together this will stabilise your dream. You know that you will wake up soon if your sight turns black or white slowly or if your senses become weaker, for example you don&#039;t hear anything or you feel nothing, this can also mean that you are just not lucid enough to use this senses. In thios case you can also rub your hands together to become more lucid</div>
