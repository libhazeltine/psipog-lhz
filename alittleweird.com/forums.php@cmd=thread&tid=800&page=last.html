After reading that you should actually NOT put your hands around the psi wheel I tried it withought them [my hands] and it worked.  So I started doing this for a few weeks but now that I try it again I can not do it; before I used to concentrate, look at it, [I would cover my mouth of course] and it would spin.  But now I can&#039;t do it, I do the same thing except this time it just vibrates/shakes a lot, and yes I know there was a thread similair to this one that asked &quot;are there times where you&#039;ve found that you can&#039;t do anything?&quot; but what I want to know is if there&#039;s anything I am doing wrong or if I can fix this.  Also, I would like to know if anybody knows of Godspeed09 because it seems that his website is very empty [or it&#039;s just me?] and I would like to know more about his/their work.<br />
