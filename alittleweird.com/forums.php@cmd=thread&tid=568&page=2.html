about death&#039;s killings, i can only think of two possible reasons on why he does it. reason one: he might be doing it for fun(in his perspective, not the victims).reason two: he is under a mission by another being more powerful than he is to kill those people he mentioned, although im more inclined to think its the first reason because of your starting post in this thread(about asking you who you want to be killed). maybe this superior being controlling &quot;death&quot; decided to grant you power(temporary or permanent i dont know) to kill someone, and &quot;death&quot; is the tool you use to kill that person, but that sounds unlikely.<br />
i believe your case is a special case of clairaudience. im saying this on the basis that you can hear &quot;death&quot; speaking to you even though you and him belong to different dimensions. if you really are clairaudient, i think you would might also hear other things that a normal person cant hear. for example, are you able to hear what your classmates or friends say even when they are whispering? if that is so then that proves you have this skill.<br />
i believe the others here have their own opinions, and i hope you gain some understanding from our opinions.</div>

<br />
First, you should figure out if you made it, )either on purpose or by accident) or if it&#039;s existed before( and is either a natural Thing, or was construct from someone else.<br />
<br />
(Warning: Scary Sentence)<br />
If you made it, it might be because you are actually the one with the power to perceive and control impending death, and you made this exterior Thing to externalize and control this ability.<br />
<br />
However, if you didn&#039;t make it, it might be that someone else made it. It could be an old construct that has latched onto you for instructions, or just to have someone to talk to.<br />
In this case, it might not be <em>Death</em> Death, but some other Death. Ask if xhe has any other names. (xhe is the gender neutral version of he and she)<br />
<br />
If it is a naturally occurring spirit, you&#039;re quite fortunate to have found such a powerful Entity! It could be your Liaison to a broader world of spirits. Although, some naturally occurring spirits are sometimes... tricky. Make sure to ask about consequences, rules and conditions. Be sure to explicitly ask for the truth each time you ask it a question.<br />
<br />
Also, can you get a sort of &quot;death clock&quot; countdown for people or animals? Do you need certain information, a face? A name? Credit card number? (a joke, that last one) I&#039;m assuming that you can only get &quot;Natural Death&quot; times, and not, say, when someone is going to be hit by a bus.<br />

If you go to another site where people listen to you and give input without any insults or disbelief towards your story, they would probably be quite fluffy themselves, which means that any advice or help you may get from them will be useless since most likely anything they say would be wrong. For instance, you go to a new site and tell your story and then one of them says: &quot;Ohh I have one of those death guys too! All you gotta do is drink Dr. Pepper and gather auric particles from the moon, earth, and stars.&quot; Obviously what that person said isn&#039;t going to help you. <br />
<br />
Then, perhaps you could go to another site that has people who are educational, intelligent, and not fluffy. They probably will immediately dismiss you. Some members may not even bother to post a response, and some may just post their disbelief and insults. So, you probably won&#039;t get help from that site either.<br />
<br />
Then there is ALittleWeird. If you stay here, I believe that there are fluffy people as well as intelligent, non fluffy people here. So, although I said both of those people won&#039;t help you, maybe you could get something out of it. My advice for getting help from the intelligent people is to speak to them on their level. To do that, you would have to have proper grammar and spelling, and you would have to explain your problem in great detail. In doing so, you may or may not get help, but some may open up to you and give their input. To get help from fluffy people, you must know what to believe, and what not to believe.</div>

i feel that putting the label &quot;fluffy&quot; on someone is as good as putting the label &quot;ex-convict&quot; on an ex-prisoner. what the poor fellow did was wrong in the eyes of the law and the society, but that does not mean he has nothing good to offer and contribute. similarly, deathmessenger&#039;s account might sound too incredible for some people, but that doesnt mean there isnt anything in his story which is worthy of learning.<br />
btw, this section of the forums is titled &quot;weird dicussions&quot; not &quot;psionic discussions&quot;, so i dont see anything wrong with posting something unrelated to psionics, as long as it is related to the paranormal.<br />
dont worry deathmessenger, i believe there are other people in alw who are more open-minded and wouldnt criticise you for what you said. just remember, always ask when you are in doubt. :-)</div>
