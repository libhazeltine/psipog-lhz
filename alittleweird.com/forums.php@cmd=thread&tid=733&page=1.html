Basically, I gathered psi in my normal way, but instead of my standard purple misty/wind like energy, I visualized a soothing blue energy, kind of like antiseptic ointment, but, you know, energy.

<br />
I&#039;ve tried biofeedback and psi healing, and the first seems to work better for me (probably because I&#039;ve had more practice with it) but the effects don&#039;t seem to be so good for cuts and things... I mostly use it for headaches. The nice thing about it is the more it works, the more you beleive it, so it works even more, etc.<br />
<br />
With psi, the effects are better, except sometimes when the wound or whatnot is really bad, it feels like someone is sticking needles into it for a bit until that fades... it actually seems to heal better after that.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should try to combine the two... oh, and aura cleaning seems to do a lot of good too. When I try to heal something in the skin it feels better, but I can still feel the grossness of the aura. When both are good it heals better.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped some... I can be more specific if you&#039;d like</div>

<br />
I was experiencing extreme discomfort in my (ahem) gonads. Then one day, someone who I deeply respected said three words to me which sent my attitude into a bit of spiral which inspired my incredible recovery.<br />
<br />
I had heard about chakras, and thought Id give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I focused on my sacral chakra by visualizing my lower stomach with an inner burning ball of bright orange light. This would usually cause me to tremble, kinda like having a really good pee.<br />
<br />
Also, when I was in pain and could not focus on this burning ball of energy, I would realize my fear and anxiety towards the pain, and instead turn it into love and compassion.<br />
<br />
Weeks later I was feeling much better. The pain only showed up every couple days, and was mostly brief when it did.. but then.. one night.. I thought I was going to die.<br />
<br />
My lower stomach was on fire, and it was the most painful thing I have yet experienced in life.<br />
<br />
Then I began to expel all kinds of bright shit.. bright red.. but not blood.. it did not even murk up the water.. it was solid.<br />
<br />
After the first two hours, my clothes began to suffocate me, and I needed to lie down on the cold ground..<br />
<br />
So there I was.. bare ass nekked on my bathroom floor.. crying..<br />
<br />
Now this is an awkward enough situation to be in all alone, but the drama aspect is juicy as heck.. (oh god) My mother had decided to take in a foreign student for the week, and this was his first night away from his parents and Japan for all his 15 years of experience.. his room had a walk in closet which was linked to the bathroom I was in.<br />
<br />
I was fucked up on the floor.. bare ass naked, puking and shitting so violently.. sobbing.. basically dieing..<br />
<br />
Every now and again, I pick myself up and try to get some sleep in my bed downstairs, and I&#039;d hear him go use the washroom.. this is like 4 in the morning at this point.<br />
<br />
Anyways, since then, I have had hardly any problems..<br />
<br />
I imagine this is an ongoing battle, or theme in my life.</div>

Yes, I do heal my own headaches sometimes using Psi (although I prefer to call it the Vital Force, but since this forums focus mainly on Psionics, I&#039;ll use Psi here, since it&#039;s mostly the same thing in my experience, though it is of course a possibility that I can not work with Psi properly, and have only had success with the Vital Force.)<br />
<br />
The problem is that most of the times that I have a big headache or migraine, I can&#039;t concentrate very well. (Odd isn&#039;t it? ^_^)<br />
So, I generally wear some enchanted/charged/whatever-term-you-use ring which I programmed to &#039;heal headaches&#039; when I touch my head with it.<br />
<br />
Once more, for people that aren&#039;t really interested in Magick this won&#039;t be really much of an useful post, however, it might be a good idea for a Psionics construct to bind to a ring as well, you never know.<br />

Maybe you should try to combine the two... oh, and aura cleaning seems to do a lot of good too. When I try to heal something in the skin it feels better, but I can still feel the grossness of the aura. When both are good it heals better.<br />

I have a cool story to tell!! (finally..)<br />
<br />
I was experiencing extreme discomfort in my (ahem) gonads. Then one day, someone who I deeply respected said three words to me which sent my attitude into a bit of spiral which inspired my incredible recovery.<br />
<br />
I had heard about chakras, and thought Id give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I focused on my sacral chakra by visualizing my lower stomach with an inner burning ball of bright orange light. This would usually cause me to tremble, kinda like having a really good pee.<br />
<br />
Also, when I was in pain and could not focus on this burning ball of energy, I would realize my fear and anxiety towards the pain, and instead turn it into love and compassion.<br />
<br />
Weeks later I was feeling much better. The pain only showed up every couple days, and was mostly brief when it did.. but then.. one night.. I thought I was going to die.<br />
<br />
My lower stomach was on fire, and it was the most painful thing I have yet experienced in life.<br />
<br />
Then I began to expel all kinds of bright shit.. bright red.. but not blood.. it did not even murk up the water.. it was solid.<br />
<br />
After the first two hours, my clothes began to suffocate me, and I needed to lie down on the cold ground..<br />
<br />
So there I was.. bare ass nekked on my bathroom floor.. crying..<br />
<br />
Now this is an awkward enough situation to be in all alone, but the drama aspect is juicy as heck.. (oh god) My mother had decided to take in a foreign student for the week, and this was his first night away from his parents and Japan for all his 15 years of experience.. his room had a walk in closet which was linked to the bathroom I was in.<br />
<br />
I was fucked up on the floor.. bare ass naked, puking and shitting so violently.. sobbing.. basically dieing..<br />
<br />
Every now and again, I pick myself up and try to get some sleep in my bed downstairs, and I&#039;d hear him go use the washroom.. this is like 4 in the morning at this point.<br />
<br />
Anyways, since then, I have had hardly any problems..<br />
<br />
I imagine this is an ongoing battle, or theme in my life.</div>That sounds. . . horrible.<br />
I&#039;m sorry to hear about it. <br />

Yes, I do heal my own headaches sometimes using Psi (although I prefer to call it the Vital Force, but since this forums focus mainly on Psionics, I&#039;ll use Psi here, since it&#039;s mostly the same thing in my experience, though it is of course a possibility that I can not work with Psi properly, and have only had success with the Vital Force.)<br />
<br />
The problem is that most of the times that I have a big headache or migraine, I can&#039;t concentrate very well. (Odd isn&#039;t it? ^_^)<br />

If you really want to, you can try to develop the skill of literally feeling auras, but I have to warn you that a lot of the time it feels plain gross. I don&#039;t think you have to worry about this part as much, but walking through school and feeling the emotions from petty dramas isn&#039;t fun. Though it does make it easier to feel nasty areas in your aura, and when they are back to normal.

Beyond all that, I try to visualize infections being eaten by white blood cells, skin cells knitting back together, skin smoothing out, etc. I use the &quot;blue ball&quot; image as well. I think it also takes some practice, esp. biofeedback =P <br />
<br />
Also, instead of conciously trying to control my body, I try to trick my brain into thinking that something is not as bad as it really is, like when I get sick I say that it&#039;s just awful allergies. Since I&#039;ve started doing that and trying to heal myself, ect, I&#039;ve only been sick a max of 2 1/2 days per sickness. Pretty awesome, considering that there were fevers.<br />

I tried out all those things on a burn I got yesterday. It was blistering, but after attempting to heal it for a bit it turned out only a little red with no pain =] Next time I get hurt I&#039;m going to take a before and after pic.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah- most importantly- stay positive and try not to get stressed in life.

Well, these logs will probably help better than I can explain... they&#039;re by Rainsong.

If you really want to, you can try to develop the skill of literally feeling auras, but I have to warn you that a lot of the time it feels plain gross. I don&#039;t think you have to worry about this part as much, but walking through school and feeling the emotions from petty dramas isn&#039;t fun. Though it does make it easier to feel nasty areas in your aura, and when they are back to normal. I would try to explain more if you were interested, but it just happened for me so I don&#039;t really know how to teach it.

&quot;Treating Pain w/o Use of Drugs&quot;- http://www.psc-online.org/articles/view.php?id=15

Beyond all that, I try to visualize infections being eaten by white blood cells, skin cells knitting back together, skin smoothing out, etc. I use the &quot;blue ball&quot; image as well. I think it also takes some practice, esp. biofeedback =P 

Also, instead of conciously trying to control my body, I try to trick my brain into thinking that something is not as bad as it really is, like when I get sick I say that it&#039;s just awful allergies. Since I&#039;ve started doing that and trying to heal myself, ect, I&#039;ve only been sick a max of 2 1/2 days per sickness. Pretty awesome, considering that there were fevers.

I tried out all those things on a burn I got yesterday. It was blistering, but after attempting to heal it for a bit it turned out only a little red with no pain =] Next time I get hurt I&#039;m going to take a before and after pic.

Oh yeah- most importantly- stay positive and try not to get stressed in life. I had a few bad cuts on my arm that were healing excruciatingly slowly, but after talking to this one person I know I felt really good about myself and everything, and the next day I woke up and the cuts were almost gone.[/quote]

Cool, thanks!

		<div id="post_13709" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">right earlier in the forum you asked about putting healing energy into an object?<br />
this is how i do it : i close my eyes , visualise the object floating in front of me i visualise a blue energy coming out of my &quot;third eye&quot; and program it to heal then i send the energy to the object when i have stored enough i send some more energy to act as a plug to keep the energy in</div>

Not much, other than a book that I read half-way through, called Quantum Touch the Power to Heal, what the author was describing sounded suspiciously similar to Psi, at least in some respects.<br />
