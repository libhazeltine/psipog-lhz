		<div id="post_7735" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">For me, it&#039;s just about every single sense I have that goes into processing whatever construct. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take the infamous psiball: This is what goes through my head:<br />
<br />
1) I develop the intention to make the psiball, I place my hands and think about the intentions.<br />
2) I visualize energy mobilizing and try to &#039;push&#039; it. I&#039;m not sure how else to describe it, it&#039;s an instinct I&#039;ve used since I got into psi, the best I can explain it is when you want to move a muscle, you don&#039;t think about moving it, you just DO. Apply that to energy. <br />
3) At this point, if I actually am pulling energy, I will get force feedback. I will feel a force counter to my energy-motive force, and (bare with me) my thoughts develop inertia and resistance. I can think the psiball anywhere I want, but it&#039;s not guaranteed to respond perfectly<br />
4) If my auric vision is working well enough, I can see the energy ripples created by it. Once again, I notice lag when I try to move it quickly or change its shape. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s still a quantitative process though. If you are open enough, your mind and the energy should reach an equilibrium in which the amount of energy you perceive is quite close to the amount of energy that is concretely there. <br />
<br />
I can usually tell when I &#039;derail,&#039; e.g. what I&#039;m thinking about is no longer having an effect on the construct (I&#039;ve gone from visualization which has intent, to just imagining). However, once I get my focus back in tune, the construct will resume forming itself into my intent. <br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always thought it would be cool to have an energy unit for psi, but it&#039;d be nearly impossible with the current technology. The closest thing we have are things like Geiger counters, which I feel only measure the effects of psi, not the pure energy. <br />

<br />
&quot;But what if it&#039;s only like... 10% correct looking :-P.&quot; - SheepKing<br />
<br />
Boom&#039;s response to this sounded right, but I&#039;d like to provide my own interpretation. I believe that what is &quot;correct&quot; is what you are consciously comfortable with. Your subconscious interprets this and provides the desired effect. I remember reading, back in the days of psipog, one of Sean&#039;s articles about energy use. In one section of the article, he talked about how you can visualize something that you associate with healing to create an actual healing response when applying it to the area of concern. The example he used was bandaids. <br />
<br />
All right, it looks like I have digressed slightly. Basically, what you consciously believe to represent a high density psi ball should be interpreted by your subconscious as such, leading to an actual dense psi ball in the physical world. <br />
<br />
As mentioned in most psi ball exercises, it is probably best to work with what you consider to be low density energy content up until you reach a high density level of energy content. This may be helpful in providing your subconscious with the material to distinguish between a low density psi ball and a high density psi ball. I believe that this is probably why I have not been able to create an actual psi ball. I never bothered making this distinguishment between dense and not so dense energy. The result was that I would only receive a low density energy sensation that my subconscious provided me as a &quot;default&quot; setting. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#039;s kind of interesting that maybe it could be just a &#039;few&#039; of whatever unit psi should be measured in, in the affected area.&quot; - SheepKing<br />
<br />
The so-called &quot;unit psi&quot; is probably just a function of how your subconscious interprets what it sees. If you have familiarized it with the difference between what you want low density and high density psi to look like, then your subconscious should be able to adjust the &quot;unit psi&quot; accordingly to that visual representation based off of its &quot;conditioning&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is all I have to say for now. I will gladly provide clarification if misunderstanding and/or disagreement arises.</div>

The actual structure and appearance likely is beyond our comprehension. Trying to get an accurate visualization of a real psi ball would probably be a lot like trying to create your own mental impression of how a substance is atomically structured (without the help of an electron microscope).<br />
<br />
Thank you for clarifying your point. This brings to mind how other psionic abilities, such as cryokinesis and pyrokinesis would require a lot of arbitration on the subconscious&#039; part. The way we visualize atoms speeding or slowing down in those exercises must be way off from what it would actually look like. <br />

We are only human afterall, not supercomputers with advanced atomic cognition.</div>
