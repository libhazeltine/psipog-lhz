<br />
Check out this movie: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/" target="_blank" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/">The Man from Earth</a><br />
<br />
The movie itself is really simple - just a bunch of people sitting around, talking, the entire movie.  But the main character claims to be an immortal cave man... so the conversation is really interesting to listen to :-).<br />
<br />
As for the idea itself - I&#039;ve never really been interested in achieving immortality, or anything like that.  I suppose my belief is that it&#039;s just natural to die... so why try to avoid it?  It would seem like that if someone were to want to be immortal, it&#039;s only because they fear death.  I suppose if someone wanted to achieve immortality for more noble reasons, I would be open to the idea - but I would still suspect those noble reasons were just cover-ups for the fear of death :-).<br />

		<div id="post_8913" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Agreed, Any form of Immortality would be both a gift and a curse. Just the Idea of not being able to die.<br />
<br />
Besides, To be truely alive one must also be able to die at any moment. If one were to be immortal, there would be no balance of death for that person and he/she would continually try to restore the balance. The only way to be immortal would be to make up for the balance of death. In movies they tend to make the immortal either a balancer of the world. In books they ussually make it so someone has to die in their place for all eternity, both would work.<br />
<br />
Besides, by the same understanding, to have this true immortality, you wouldn&#039;t be able to advance any more from the point you became immortal, because every essence of your being, good and bad, would stay alive for eternity.<br />
<br />
In the spiritual sense we have today, our concience is immortal. There are tons of theories behind it, the one I favor involves your concience being energy.<br />
<br />
in Reality everything is immortal, and therefore nothing is Immortal. Duality? Not by my understanding of the term. <br />

If I were Immortal I could not be alive, that is my conclusion. <br />

If I were to be immortal, I would probably livemy life only to keep the balance. I would the be confronted by some ignorant person of Justice who would try t stop me, and end up killing me which would then truely restore balance to the world... and then we have a movie ^_^. <br />

		<div id="post_8919" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve been thinking about immortality a lot lately. Not for myself, mind you, just about the idea of it. Thinking about if someone was immortal how things would start to appear over time.<br />
<br />
You start off in life (as the immortal mind you) as everyone else, but then at your bodies peak you start to notice the people around you growing older. At a certain point all of your immediate family, and all of the first set of friends you made have died; And in their place lie their children, and your nephews and neices and what not. Had you had a wife and kids, they too have died and been &#039;replaced&#039; by more family.<br />
<br />
At a certain point you understand that you can&#039;t die. For some time you are filled with the sorrow of losing all of the ones you love and the realization that anyone you  will ever meet; and anyone you will ever fall in love with will die, along with any children you have. During the beginning of your life you viewed death with the equal fear that others have felt for it. But overtime that fear is probably replaced with the desire to meet death. I&#039;d imagine at one point you would view death as a release from the pain of the world as you see man making the same mistakes over and over again in life.

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_8919">I&#039;ve been thinking about immortality a lot lately. Not for myself, mind you, just about the idea of it. Thinking about if someone was immortal how things would start to appear over time.

You start off in life (as the immortal mind you) as everyone else, but then at your bodies peak you start to notice the people around you growing older. At a certain point all of your immediate family, and all of the first set of friends you made have died; And in their place lie their children, and your nephews and neices and what not. Had you had a wife and kids, they too have died and been &#039;replaced&#039; by more family.

This is the Idea behind the creature known as a Lich in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.

<br />
To put it into modern terms. If we were to become modern day lichs, immortals. all we have to do is create regular backups of our minds, and when we die, we set it up so that all the &quot;files&quot; transfer into a new brains format. Withthis technique, we could, in essence, live forever. Without upsetting the balance. I feel that, if it wasn&#039;t for human stupidity, we may have reached this point by now.<br />

Even more, If human cloning were perfected, we could create new bodies for ourselves, without all the moral issues of killing one to save another, because by the majority of the world&#039;s religeon we would consider these bodies as Soul-less.<br />

That could be reversed though.. because you could even say things such as science it&#039;s self has a possibility of being completely wrong.<br />

Yeah, I agree, of course you have to learn the system to function in a world that calls it law.  You have to learn science to be accepted among scientists and you have to learn the religion to be accepted among a specific sect.<br />
<br />
But every group of people who say &quot;The world is this way! And every one else is wrong!&quot;<br />
Is no different from a religion.  Science, atheist, etc etc, are all included in that. Some are just more complex than other, and thus persuade more people.<br />
<br />
You can prove something in the religious world that won&#039;t work in the science world, and you can prove something in the Psionic world that won&#039;t work in the science world,<br />
you can prove something in the western world that would work in the eastern, visa versa, and all because they run off of different accepted norms and laws.<br />
<br />
But to be stuck to those laws and say that everything else is wrong just because you&#039;re too arrogant to believe there&#039;s a -different- way to do something outside of your laws, is idiotic and blind.<br />
<br />
Also, dedicating yourself to a small portion of a message for the purpose of demonstrating your inflated ego rather than actually looking at the deeper meaning and getting something out of it is just simply trivial and self damaging. <br />
