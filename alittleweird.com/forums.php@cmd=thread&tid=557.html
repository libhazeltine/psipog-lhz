<br />
The current lack-of-progress you see is a result of the mindset of the &quot;community&quot;.  There hasn&#039;t been progress because people - in general - don&#039;t want progress.  They want the status quo.<br />
<br />
So what is the status quo?  Self-delusional magical thinking.<br />
<br />
The &quot;community&quot;, as a whole, has made an unconscious compromise.  That compromise is this: If you believe what we believe, then it&#039;s ok if you don&#039;t believe it for the right reasons.  Just join us anyway - it&#039;s all good.  In fact, we aren&#039;t even sure WE believe it for the right reasons, so who cares.<br />
<br />
This mindset is the root of the lack-of-progress that you witness.<br />
<br />
So, what are the &quot;right&quot; reasons, and what are the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons?<br />
<br />
Right - discover truth about reality.<br />
<br />
Wrong - everything else.  (Ok, maybe not <em>everything else</em>, but for the most part.)<br />
<br />
As long as most people are content with their self-delusional magical thinking, then you won&#039;t really see progress.<br />
