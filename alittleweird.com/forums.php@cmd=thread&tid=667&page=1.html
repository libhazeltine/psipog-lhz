		<div id="post_12772" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Sit back, long story.<br />
<br />
Well let me start off with my life. I&#039;m half Japanese, half African American, and born in Japan. When I was five, my father, missing his family (and out of a military job), I was forced to move to America. Since I was born I grew up in a strict Christian home, where I was forced &quot;Do this, do that, you&#039;ll go to hell.&quot;. I often times wonder what my life would be like if I were Shinto. However, I was a protestant, better than being catholic I guess. My parents were zealots, and  naturally, I began growing up as a zealot as well. <br />
<br />
A close-minded Christian child who couldn&#039;t stand people bashing it, and would defend it with a heartbeat. My only hint of doubts began, when my life started to turn to shit. and my thoughts about Christianity began to contradict my fathers. I believe this happened around the time when my father became a pastor, and started his own church. My father was a tyrant to me and my older sisters, treating us very unfairly. I won&#039;t go into that right now, but my father has always had serious anger management problems. The only people I&#039;ve talked to about these doubts were online, as I could barely trust any of my real life friends to understand. <br />
<br />
One, happen to be a wiccan, and a good friend. He didn&#039;t really push his beliefs on me, and I still go to him today for wisdom. The other, happened to be a Christian. I was encouraged by this person, but not pushed, to keep trying Christianity. I don&#039;t know which of the two next events came first, but one, I would talk to my wiccan friend. We would talk about the astral plane, a subject that was totally new to me. I couldn&#039;t see him as a liar, so I did what was forced into my mindset. Assume that his astral projection was an influenced vision by satan. <br />
<br />
However I asked him how he entered the astral plane, and he told me &quot;You let your body sleep, but keep your mind awake.&quot; The next night, out of curiosity, I relaxed all my muscles till I couldn&#039;t feel them, and tried to stay awake, with my eyes closed and trying to see beyond my sight. Suddenly these vibration overcame me, and I felt this amazing sensation like I was floating and falling at the same time and I began seeing a bright light. It scared the HELL, at of me so I &quot;fell back into my body&quot;. This creaked open the closed door of my mind, however, I still used the devil as a scapegoat. I told my wiccan friend about it, he wasn&#039;t suprised at all. I told my Christian friend, and she was very... Skeptic. Now the other event is that is when my hatred and agnst for my father began to grow, so I didn&#039;t go to church one day. He would glare at angrily as we talked that afternoon, I believe i said &quot;grounding me would be pointless&quot; and he immediately spoke of my punishment. I sprung up enough guts to speak at least a little of my mind that day. I told him &quot;You are a liar...&quot; Suddenly my dad lunged at me, pushing me through the door behind me into the enclosed  corner of my small bathroom. <br />
<br />
He basicly started hitting me across the face in a defensive manner and shoving me against the wall. Yeah, a well built African American grown man, WHO WAS A PASTOR, beating up skinny (I believe I was 12 years old) kid. I begged him, pleading him, to stop, telling him I&#039;m sorry and crying. Not only that, but once my mother finnally pulled him back and I ran to my room, my father threatened to KILL ME, if I called the police. That day I tried to run away from home, however I my mother saw me jump out my window and she immediately told my dad and sisters. My sisters chased after me and my dad yelled at me to come back as I was half way down the street with no shoes on, and a domestic violence phone number in my hand. If it wasn&#039;t for my sisters, I may have just ran, but my father problably would have caught and stopped me anyways. When I came back me and my father talked in the living room, he justified his beating me up with &quot;Maybe that&#039;s what you needed&quot;. I felt like getting on and punching him across the face at that point. Anything afterwards in that day, is now a blur to me. <br />
Now soon later, I talked to my Christian friend online, I told her &quot;Where was god when me father was hitting me across the face huh?!&quot;, I pretty much exploded, as she couldn&#039;t justify me with an answer. Soon enough, we stopped talking. When I told my wiccan friend, he only sympathized for me. <br />
<br />
My faith in Christianity quickly began to dwindle, yet somehow I still believed in it. About a year later, I decided &quot;I&#039;m not going to believe in a religion unless I believe in it, and not because it was forced on me.&quot; That&#039;s when I stopped being a zealot. My wiccan friend hadn&#039;t spoke with me in quite a while, and he told me I grew and matured a lot, not just in my beliefs. As I often asked god to show me proof of his existence, and nothing ever happened. Half my mind believes in Christianity out of fear of hell, the other had serious doubts, and often times was even against it. A long while later, last year. I haven&#039;t had a successful astral projection to my name, yet I still believed in it, though I feared trying. I met a friend online who I found out knew a lot about OBEs and the astral plane and the sort. He grew up in a strict Christian home too, and 15 was the age he stopped believing in it. Amazing, because that&#039;s exactly how old I was, (And still am). <br />
<br />
It was infact only a few months ago I  believe, that he put my world into an amazing perspective. One where right and wrong are so clear. One where I don&#039;t have to be afraid of hell. However, since it was forced into me, it was like a sixth sense to fear it. He recommended me to books with excirsizes for OBEing like Robert Peterson&#039;s. HOWEVER, for the past few months, I&#039;ve been trying to astral project, but it&#039;s become very difficult for me. I rarley start to get that spark of vibrations, and even when I get the SMALLEST spark, my breathing starts to become heavy, and it disappears. Not only that, but I still have a fear of hell and demons and fear of the unknown, it&#039;s ALOT less than before, but still large an irrational. Not to mention ironicly, somewhat a fear of the supernatural. Especially ghosts (I could never sit through horror movies.) So that&#039;s my story. I&#039;ve left out some interesting events, but I think I&#039;ve written A LOOOT already, and this isn&#039;t some autobiography. xD<br />
<br />
By the way, I&#039;m 15 and still living in my parents house.<br />
Also I&#039;d like to know about your astral projection experiences.</div>

Okay, so it&#039;s said to be a GOOD thing to fear demons. I personally have an insatiable interest in them, and I&#039;ve been told that it&#039;s extremely unhealthy and dangerous. That people like me ATTRACT them, because we are so open to them.<br />

Anyway, I think fear is not a good thing. It weakens you and might even cause, well lets just call it &quot;demons&quot;. As I read in William Buhlman&#039;s Book &quot;Out of Body&quot;, the astral planes are very sensitive to thoughts. The deeper the plane the more effect will have your thoughts. That would be, if you are afraid of demons and/or devils, then you are thinking of them while trying to or actually having an OBE and since Fear can be a very strong emotion, you could just create those by yourself.</div>

<br />
Well, I do not like to speak about the past but if it helps, then it helps. It has been many years now, but I used to live with my mom, dad, and brother. My father was a strong man and used to abuse us all. One day, out of the blue, my mom came up with a pretty smart plan, and we all ran away from him. More than a thousand miles away, heh. <br />
<br />
Abusive behavior is a serious problem. Fortuanetly for me, I had someone to get me out of the situation, but for you... I do not really know what you can do. You as a child need to be supported obviously, and you can&#039;t do that by yourself. Maybe you should try getting stronger? Do some weight lifting and be stronger than your father? I don&#039;t know. Just keep in mind, it&#039;s a serious problem, and something needs to be done about it. <br />
<br />
Now, onto the next subject. Astral projection and OBE&#039;s have nothing to do with the Devil, or demons as for as I know. And, Wiccans do not &quot;worship&quot; the devil either. A lot of things can be scary the first time, especially paranormal things. That just makes it more exciting, I&#039;m sure that if you do it a second time it will not be as scary as the first, because you know what to expect now. And just a little comment to all the other posters... I do not think you should all just speak about demons as if they are proven to be real.</div>

		<div id="post_12968" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;m really sorry I haven&#039;t posted everyone. I&#039;ve been busy latley and I kind of forgot about this topic, and procrastinated my reply. Thanks for your replies. Any who, I&#039;m pretty aware of what to do while during in OBE, if I ever meet negative spirits. I however, refuse to believe in demons. At least what demons are in a generic sense.  I do believe there are negative spirits out there, and I do believe they can do things to you. However, I believe they can if you ALLOW them to. To quote Robert Peterson, <br />
<br />
&quot;The second kind of demon is a spirit that is playing the roll of a demon.  This kind of &quot;demon&quot; is really just an astral entity who is no different from you or me, but they&#039;re impersonating a demon.  Maybe they&#039;re trying to intimidate you or frighten you, but they are impostors nonetheless.  Like any stranger you meet on the street, the entity might be benign or malign.  They may have good or bad intentions, but they can only possess your physical body while you&#039;re away if you give them permission to, or if you&#039;re frightened enough to give up control of your body.  As long as you remain fearless, they cannot harm your body and they can&#039;t steal your body.  Even if they could control your body, they couldn&#039;t hold onto it for long.&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve brought myself to believe they can only have power over you if you have fear. For another more famous quote &quot;the only thing to fear is fear itself&quot;. Hey, don&#039;t get me wrong, I love thrill seeking as much as the next guy. But at a point like this, I can&#039;t allow fear to control me. That&#039;s what I fear, that I will allow fear to overcome my courage, and that I will allow these negative spirits to hurt me. I&#039;m a bit skeptic about ghosts, I mean, spirits may be able to set their frequency so low, that we are able to see them, or maybe from time to time, the great amount of spiritual energy in one area can trigger our astral eyes to take over. But that&#039;s just my theory. However I don&#039;t believe they can do harm to your physical body. Aslong as you don&#039;t give them the power to anyways. In conclusion. Yes, I do think thrill is good, no I don&#039;t think fear empowers you in any way to do anything. Also, somefatguy, my mom did think about leaving my father once. But since everything has calmed down latley, things just aren&#039;t hectic enough to leave him, and my sister may move out within the next year (She&#039;s 25). If I get a job and move out with her, we&#039;ll be free of my father. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the reason I HATE fear more than anything is because of how it tortured my life. I always feared my father, and as soon as I was brave enough just to stand up to him a little bit, knowing even though he&#039;s so much stronger than me, that meant so much to me. It felt good, however getting beaten the shit out of, did not feel good. I still regret today that I didn&#039;t fight fight back, even if I got massivly injured in the proccess. However, I wish to nolonger let anger consume me, and make it the only thing to empower my bravery. I want to be brave on my own, not based off of angst.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the comments everyone. Heres a list of things I believe in.<br />
<br />
OBE, negative spirits who are empowered through your fear, astral plane, ghosts (in a sense, explained earliar.). I&#039;m skeptic about psi energy (Though I&#039;m DEFINATLY not canceling it off as &quot;non-existant&quot;) and aliens.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Oh and just to add, more inspiring words from Robert Peterson.<br />
&quot;          Fears are detrimental - discard them.<br />
Anytime we face the unknown, it can be frightening.  But approaching anything with fear is harmful.  Early European sailors believed the Earth was flat and they could sail off the edge.  Because of their fear of the unknown, they concluded it was dangerous to sail too far west.  When they conquered their fear and went bravely ahead, not only did they discover a whole new world, they also made the transition from two-dimensional thinking to three-dimensional thinking about their reality.  Likewise, if we can conquer our fears, we will also discover a whole new world, and we will make the transition from three-dimensional thinking to four-or-more-dimensional thinking about our reality.<br />
            <br />
All the great pioneers have set aside their fears, at least temporarily, and gone ahead despite the dangers.  Courage is not the ability to walk into danger without fear.  Courage is the ability to walk into a dangerous or frightening situation and think to yourself, &#039;Yes, I&#039;m scared‑‑I&#039;m scared to death‑‑but that&#039;s not going to stop me.&#039;&quot;</div>

Any who, I&#039;m pretty aware of what to do while during in OBE, if I ever meet negative spirits. I however, refuse to believe in demons. At least what demons are in a generic sense.  I do believe there are negative spirits out there, and I do believe they can do things to you. However, I believe they can if you ALLOW them to. To quote Robert Peterson, 

&quot;The second kind of demon is a spirit that is playing the roll of a demon.  This kind of &quot;demon&quot; is really just an astral entity who is no different from you or me, but they&#039;re impersonating a demon.  Maybe they&#039;re trying to intimidate you or frighten you, but they are impostors nonetheless.  Like any stranger you meet on the street, the entity might be benign or malign.  They may have good or bad intentions, but they can only possess your physical body while you&#039;re away if you give them permission to, or if you&#039;re frightened enough to give up control of your body.  As long as you remain fearless, they cannot harm your body and they can&#039;t steal your body.  Even if they could control your body, they couldn&#039;t hold onto it for long.&quot;

I&#039;ve brought myself to believe they can only have power over you if you have fear. For another more famous quote &quot;the only thing to fear is fear itself&quot;. Hey, don&#039;t get me wrong, I love thrill seeking as much as the next guy. But at a point like this, I can&#039;t allow fear to control me. That&#039;s what I fear, that I will allow fear to overcome my courage, and that I will allow these negative spirits to hurt me. I&#039;m a bit skeptic about ghosts, I mean, spirits may be able to set their frequency so low, that we are able to see them, or maybe from time to time, the great amount of spiritual energy in one area can trigger our astral eyes to take over. But that&#039;s just my theory. However I don&#039;t believe they can do harm to your physical body. Aslong as you don&#039;t give them the power to anyways. In conclusion. Yes, I do think thrill is good, no I don&#039;t think fear empowers you in any way to do anything. Also, somefatguy, my mom did think about leaving my father once. But since everything has calmed down latley, things just aren&#039;t hectic enough to leave him, and my sister may move out within the next year (She&#039;s 25). If I get a job and move out with her, we&#039;ll be free of my father. 

Anyways, the reason I HATE fear more than anything is because of how it tortured my life. I always feared my father, and as soon as I was brave enough just to stand up to him a little bit, knowing even though he&#039;s so much stronger than me, that meant so much to me. It felt good, however getting beaten the shit out of, did not feel good. I still regret today that I didn&#039;t fight fight back, even if I got massivly injured in the proccess. However, I wish to nolonger let anger consume me, and make it the only thing to empower my bravery. I want to be brave on my own, not based off of angst.

Thanks again for the comments everyone. Heres a list of things I believe in.

OBE, negative spirits who are empowered through your fear, astral plane, ghosts (in a sense, explained earliar.). I&#039;m skeptic about psi energy (Though I&#039;m DEFINATLY not canceling it off as &quot;non-existant&quot;) and aliens.

Edit:
Oh and just to add, more inspiring words from Robert Peterson.
&quot;          Fears are detrimental - discard them.
Anytime we face the unknown, it can be frightening.  But approaching anything with fear is harmful.  Early European sailors believed the Earth was flat and they could sail off the edge.  Because of their fear of the unknown, they concluded it was dangerous to sail too far west.  When they conquered their fear and went bravely ahead, not only did they discover a whole new world, they also made the transition from two-dimensional thinking to three-dimensional thinking about their reality.  Likewise, if we can conquer our fears, we will also discover a whole new world, and we will make the transition from three-dimensional thinking to four-or-more-dimensional thinking about our reality.
            
All the great pioneers have set aside their fears, at least temporarily, and gone ahead despite the dangers.  Courage is not the ability to walk into danger without fear.  Courage is the ability to walk into a dangerous or frightening situation and think to yourself, &#039;Yes, I&#039;m scared‑‑I&#039;m scared to death‑‑but that&#039;s not going to stop me.&#039;&quot;</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

So your dad threatened to kill you if you call the police. So you didn&#039;t.<br />
So you&#039;re saying that your dad never leaves home, you&#039;re homeschooled, have no friends etc.<br />
Because otherwise how could he kill you if you&#039;re not there. At school you could have gone to any teacher and told them about it.<br />
At a friend&#039;s house you could have done the same.<br />

Hell, if you called the police, told them what he did AND that he says he&#039;s going to kill you for making the call....<br />
<br />
I doubt he&#039;dve killed you. It wouldn&#039;t end well for him either way. <br />
<br />
So I&#039;m finding a bunch of holes in what you&#039;re saying-and I&#039;m forced to take the standpoint of a skeptic. <br />

Plus the fact that you&#039;ve pretty much already had the answers for yourself that everyone tried to give to you.<br />

Which brings me to three plausible conclusions.<br />

1) You&#039;re attention-seeking<br />
2) You are EXTREMELY gullible-which happens to be reinforced in your first post and the last post, as you seem to be taking one person&#039;s POV as THE POV. Did you even TRY to research beyond one person?<br />
