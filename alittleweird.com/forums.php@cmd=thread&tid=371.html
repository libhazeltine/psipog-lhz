		<div id="post_8239" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It seems to me that back in the day I was really excited about &quot;psi&quot;. I remember when I first started practicing psychokinesis all those years back (Yeah, I guess it has been that long), and just practicing hours on end with no results, but still excited and still waiting for the second that something moved.<br />
<br />
I remember walking home from school everyday imagining myself covered with energy, moving it around, shaping it, playing with it. I&#039;d walk through the hallways projecting images of random things in areas. Clouds, Spiders, Fire... And I got some really strange responses from people. <br />
<br />
There was this sort of unyielding desire to be able to do this amazing stuff.<br />
<br />
But now; I&#039;ll be lucky to be excited if anything psychic happens. It&#039;s just not a big deal anymore. Sometimes I still think &quot;That was pretty cool.&quot;, or I&#039;ll briefly discuss  something that happened with someone else. But most of the time, playing with psi doesn&#039;t make me feel like I want to keep doing it. If I close my eyes to meditate and practice, I&#039;ll get bored and fall asleep. <br />
<br />
Where&#039;d the emotion go?<br />
<br />
I can see this as a fundamental problem that people in general have. They are initially excited for a while about something, but as time goes on that feeling fades. This question of where did the emotion go brings us back to many portions of our life. Perhaps identifying why it happens, can help identify how it can be solved.<br />
<br />
What is an area of your life that you where excited about, that you have you dreamed about... Yet as time passed you slowly lost the enthusiasm?</div>

		<div id="post_8252" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">You finally got control over your psi, and it became an everyday thing to you. It is very clear to me what happened to the emotion. You got bored. Its quite like having a crush, but nothing new happens and sends you farther down that exciting path and you loose sight of it.(this is assuming you didnt find anything wrong with the guy) A better example would be taking drugs of having sex(...) You&#039;re brain is exciting and reacts in many ways at first, but it gets used to it and after awhile you have very little emotion towards it<br />
<br />
if you dont have withdrawals when you try to stop doing &quot;psi&quot; for longer periods of time, then sex would be a better explanation. And I&#039;m not trying to sound stupid or immature using sex as an example. I&#039;m just trying to give you an example that makes alot of sense.</div>

There was once I sent out a weird email about magic. My Ex (freak when it comes to psi) Completely yelled at me and told me I had no Idea what I was talking about and that I didnt even get to understand the meaning of magic. Then he told me later that he had a weird experience with it. (sorry if I keep refering to him, but he is the one of only 2 psi practicing person  I know.)<br />

I still had the email, I would post it up. I&#039;ll try looking for it.</div>

Also, I really like Sean&#039;s idea of cycling through interests. I always just worry that I&#039;ll lose my know-how in one area if I stop being as interested in it for a while (bad experiences with forgetting how to be good at the violin...). I guess this doesn&#039;t have to be a problem, though. Depends how long your personal cycle is. =)<br />

Yeah, but you sometimes have to be careful. If you get involved in another thing because you bored with one thing, you may loose interest forever. THats almost happened to me before.</div>
