<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">A baktun is 20 katun cycles of the ancient Maya Long Count Calendar. It contains 144,000 days or 400 tuns or nearly 400 tropical years. The Classic period of Maya civilization occurred during the 8th and 9th baktuns of the current calendrical cycle. The current (12th) baktun will end, or be completed, on 13.0.0.0.0 (December 21, 2012 using the GMT correlation). This also marks the beginning of the 13th baktun, as such a term is usually used among Mayanists.<br />
<br />
J. Eric S. Thompson states that when a Long Count of, say, 9.15.10.0.0 is placed in the 9th baktun, we are almost certainly committing an error. However, that practice is so well established among Maya epigraphers and other students of the Maya that to change it would cause more harm than its perpetuation.</div>perfect excerpt from wiki. from all the information ive seen on the subject the mayans did not predict what would happen or not happen on this date. more over, it was believed that they simply did not know what was to come after that time, only that their calendar completed itself there. 13 being the final number in one of the basic calculations of their calendar system (also correlating to the completion of the astrological cycle - all 12 houses/zodiacs).<br />
<br />
long story short, ive come to believe that they used this date/time as a marker for a changing of &quot;eras.&quot; just like the changing of baktun to baktun before it, except that this is the first time (according to them/that calendar) that the calendar has completed. i would assume that means the calendar would start over, only at a higher octave/resonance/level. this mirrors the setup of their calendar system as a whole... one cycle repeats as it rolls over into another cycle that repeats in kind.<br />
<br />
should you expect anything crazy to happen on that day? probably not, save possibly some interesting\unique astrological events. more than likely you should be aware, that as we approach and move past that date, of what changes are occuring in the world and your life and in what direction they are going.<br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_7609">from what i understand, that is possible, yes.

the 1 book thing, i may be off base about that. i know there was a famous mayan priest/prophet where a lot of information comes from and he authored that one book im thinking of. however that may not be the only surviving mayan text, or the only text on the calendar... it could be, but i would definitely have to check into that to be sure.

id bet there are plenty of resources that could enlighten you way more than i could, but i did want to throw out there the idea ive come across having been exposed to a lot of it.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_7610" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Doomsday advocates have been around for ages and the mayan calender has been speculated about a lot in recent years. At best it just represents a changing of cycle like shift from one astrological age to another, some suggest it happening soon but most don&#039;t place such an event for another 150 years or more. Theres a guy who claims to have created a graph from the I Ching that corresponds starting with its creation to end in 2012. 64 symbols repeating 64 times, but theres no reason to believe that logic would just end there and the cycle wouldn&#039;t do that pattern another 64 times and continue in that fashion. Theres also the ever present christian belief in a coming judgement, and political unrest with weapons too powerful for our own good.<br />
<br />
Y2k was a technological fear, with mythological undertones.. 2012 is a mythological fear with an interesting number of planetary concerns. The issue of global warming, being due for a rather dramatic polar shift and the unknown effects of the higher gravity density of passing through the galactic plane. If you want to make a case for judgement day theres plenty of information out there, anyone can connect dots... the thing to ask is are the dots really related.</div>
