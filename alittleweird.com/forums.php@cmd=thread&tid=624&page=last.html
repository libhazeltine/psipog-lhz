Most of the Psion Guild has pretty much given up on PK, its not even in the equation to them. They think its something that should only be attemted after years and years of practice with other stuff. Veritas on the other hand thinks its just like any other psi skill, you can start it whenever you want, and you get results with it just like the other stuff. <br />
<br />
Me, I&#039;m with Veritas. I think you can learn any skill in any order you want, and do whatever. Read Seans last ebook. <br />

Saying it needs years of practice is like comparing it to Dungeons and Dragons. Your wizard can only learn certain spells at certain levels. That is most likely not the case with PK or any psychic ability. </div>

If training leads in moving bigger and heavyer objects, then it has had its purpose.<br />
Wasting time and energy aboud pondering psiwheels &quot;validity&quot; is at best futile.. So what if 1/4 or 1/8 of the effects are from wind?<br />

You are still focusing on task and attempting the movement. <br />

In theory, however; I believe that it requires a total of 3 things to work.<br />
<br />
1.) Guidance (something to guide the force, i.e. you)<br />
<br />
2.) Energy (change requires energy, it&#039;s physics.)<br />
<br />
3.) A focal point (Some way for you to focus all of the energy onto one object.)<br />
<br />
 A good analogy that would explain why this should work is a magnifying glass. Normally, you can Stand in the sun and effect what gets more heat and less heat based of your physical position. This doesn&#039;t mean that you can light something on fire, unless of course, you have a magnifying glass. The Magnifying glass adds a focal point to the equation, which means you can focus the suns energy onto a single point, and cause the fire.<br />
<br />
 The same Idea applied to Psionics would tell you that you can effect slight degrees of change (i.e. chance), but to really do damage requires a Psionic &quot;magnifying glass&quot; <br />
<br />
 I do believe that Macro-PK is possible, I just haven&#039;t had the opportunity to see it or experience it for myself, so I can&#039;t say conclusively that it works. So much to do so little time, I guess it all comes down to whether you believe or not in the end of things. Meh... to each their own.</div>
