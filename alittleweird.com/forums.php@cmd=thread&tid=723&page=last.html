		<div id="post_13537" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi this is one of pizzaboys friends posting on his account. My grandfather passed away a few days ago and he loved Easter. Well all his grandchildren were over at my house hunting easter eggs and everyone was taking pictures. I took a picture of one of my cousins on a digital camera and a really bright orb showed up in it. I didn&#039;t use a flash and there was NOTHING for light to reflect off of. There are also weird rings around the orb as well which a camera bug wouldn&#039;t make. Tell me what you think of it.  <a href="http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/1494/img1765.jpg" target="_blank">http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/1494/img1765.jpg</a></div>

On the same page as this, there were &quot;orb&quot; pictures that are generally the same as every other &quot;orb&quot; photo.  Interestingly enough, they try to debunk that the &quot;orbs&quot; are just dust, but only test if the dust is floating around.  They tossed dust in the air and took a photo, which obviously doesn&#039;t look like the &quot;orbs&quot;.  They did appear foolish to me when they took a picture with some dust within an inch of the camera, looking just like orbs ( <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/orbs/100_0121.JPG" target="_blank">http://www.greatdreams.com/orbs/100_0121.JPG</a>), and stating:<br />
<br />
&quot;So, its pretty obvious that the dust has to be practically on the lens of the camera to show orbs of light from the camera flash.<br />
<br />
&quot;One has to admit that dust creates orbs of light, but in photos of other people, the cameras are many feet away from the orbs, they are not close to the camera at all,&quot; which completely ignores the fact that the if the dust is a bit smaller, it will look like it&#039;s farther away.<br />
<br />
Back to yours.  One question I have that would be hard to answer would be why only that picture out of all taken would have something in it.  And why your cousin?  If it were your recently deceased grandfather, did they have a better relationship with that cousin than any other people?<br />

EDIT: Well, since the first link is broken and I can&#039;t fix it, just copy/paste it on Google Image search and find the one from the website.</div>

If it were your recently deceased grandfather, did they have a better relationship with that cousin than any other people?</div>Well, my grandpa loved his grandchildren and liked to be with them a lot so that could explain why my cousin. And i honestly cant say why only 1 picture has it. There weren&#039;t too many more pictures taken after that because i just happen to flip through them and saw that. I borrowed a camcorder off one of my other relatives there and started recording. nothing showed up on it either though. It was probably pure luck i caught a picture of it. Also your first link is 404 but I was able to find it with a quick search.<br />

The closest I&#039;ve come up with after a quick Google Image search is this: http://www.greatdreams.com/orbs/east_cem_spirit_orb_big.jpg.  Obviously there are some differences, such as that this one appears to be more pinkish/purplish than yours, which is whitish/grayish.  On the same page as this, there were &quot;orb&quot; pictures that are generally the same as every other &quot;orb&quot; photo.  Interestingly enough, they try to debunk that the &quot;orbs&quot; are just dust, but only test if the dust is floating around.  They tossed dust in the air and took a photo, which obviously doesn&#039;t look like the &quot;orbs&quot;.  They did appear foolish to me when they took a picture with some dust within an inch of the camera, looking just like orbs (http://www.greatdreams.com/orbs/100_0121.JPG), and stating:

&quot;So, its pretty obvious that the dust has to be practically on the lens of the camera to show orbs of light from the camera flash.

&quot;One has to admit that dust creates orbs of light, but in photos of other people, the cameras are many feet away from the orbs, they are not close to the camera at all,&quot; which completely ignores the fact that the if the dust is a bit smaller, it will look like it&#039;s farther away.

Back to yours.  One question I have that would be hard to answer would be why only that picture out of all taken would have something in it.  And why your cousin?  If it were your recently deceased grandfather, did they have a better relationship with that cousin than any other people?[/quote]

Well, my grandpa loved his grandchildren and liked to be with them a lot so that could explain why my cousin. And i honestly cant say why only 1 picture has it. There weren&#039;t too many more pictures taken after that because i just happen to flip through them and saw that. I borrowed a camcorder off one of my other relatives there and started recording. nothing showed up on it either though. It was probably pure luck i caught a picture of it.

what i&#039;d like to know is what kind of camera you used and if it uses any compression on export or if you can export as a raw image file. what model of camera do you use and what programs did you use to export it from the camera to your computer?</div>

		<div id="post_13725" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Your picture&#039;s orb is too flat, I mean it has no depth dimension, like a draw in 2 dimensions. I would bet that the camera&#039;s film had an inconsistency on that specific frame, but you said you used a digital one...<br />
So Redregon took the words out of my mouth (kind of :P )<br />
I&#039;ll make my own picture editions then I&#039;ll report what happens.<br />
<br />
NEWS:<br />
<br />
This is what I&#039;ve got which lead to inconclusive, but a cool effect indeed: <img src="http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1135/heavlyeditedorb.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
What I&#039;ve done was (all in GIMP) use an overriden red eye removal tool, then emphasize the colours and edges. Finally I used the over-exposition tool and saved with the addition of 25% smoothing.<br />
<br />
The new (edited) picture shows off a weird pixelation of the orbs&#039; edges (and as you can see, turning them red pinkish). This makes me lean my thinking to the compression problem hypothesis. Still unsure.</div>
