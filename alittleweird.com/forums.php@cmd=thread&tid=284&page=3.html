		<div id="post_13042" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi everyone. I might have had a paranormal experience as well. Right now, I&#039;m living in a house that was built before my dad&#039;s good friend&#039;s dad was married....And that&#039;s a looooong time ago. Anyway, a few days after we moved in (Times are tough right now...got evicted from our old townhouse) I had my solar light shining directly in my face. I&#039;m a scaredy cat, I admit it. But when I got up to shine it a little more on my body, I heard what appeared to be my parent&#039;s bedroom door opening, along with &quot;footsteps&quot;. I say it in quotes because they sounded irregular... Anyway, So I thought...hmm...Probably gonna&#039; go smoke outside or something...Anyway, the overhead light coming from the kitchen was shining 1/100 into the dining area, and .000001 of the light shining on my bed (My bedroom is in the living room/parlor)When it sounded like whoever was walking down the dark hallway was gonna hit the light, I saw a faint yet rather clear image of a face that sort of dissolved.  Now...this was last year. (the story I just told, I mean. Sometimes, when I&#039;m scared, I recite      Psalms 23:4 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Try it sometime. It works wonders ;) The story I&#039;m gonna tell you guys happened when I was around 2 or 3 years old. I&#039;m 12 right now and will be 13 in July. Anyway, when I asked my mom if I have ever had an imaginary friend before ( I was 7 at the time) and she told me, &quot;You had one when your were a baby.  Sometimes, when you were upstairs, I could hear you laughing. When you came downstairs, I asked who you were playing with and you told me &#039;My friend&#039;. When I asked who your friend was, you just told me he was a nice, old man with a beard. When we brought you to your grandmother&#039;s house, you&#039;re grandmother  just recently put a picture of you&#039;re grandfather up on a dresser in the parlor/living room. As soon as you saw it, you said &#039;That&#039;s the old man that I play with, mommy&#039;. Yet you never once laid your eyes on a picture of your grandfather before.&quot;  <br />
<br />
O.O WTH!!? How is this possible? ...Well, my time is up (shower time) so lem&#039;me know what you guys think of my experiences...<br />

		<div id="post_13200" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">About a year ago WEIRD stuff started hapenening at my house. At the time this stuff started happening was the same time I started watching the Ghost hunters show on The SciFi channel. I was SOOOOOO interested in the subject, Ghosts? THATS AMAZING! In fact, I watched it so much and was so interested in the subject I oftenwondered how it would be with Paranormal activity going on withing my house, BIG MISTAKE.<br />
<br />
<br />
I started seeing shadows in the shape of people, Istarted having doors WITHOUT LOCKS locking on me! I started hearing voices saying things like: &quot;fuck&quot;,&quot;Austin!&quot;(thats my name), and other random words. Our cats started chasing and jumping at non-seeable things (Looked like they were retarded or something). Things would move on their own, one time I put my glasses down to go to sleep, and they FLEW across the room. The last time I checked, when something falls, it will go down NOT FLING ITSELF ACROSS THE ROOM.<br />
<br />
I told my Mom, Grandma, and my Grandpa about these experiences. All three of them had TONS of stories of experiences they had. My Mom told experiences of my grandma&#039;s house when she was a kid. My mom said that she used to hear people inside their kitchen at night and would ask everyone the following morning to find that NON of them were in the kitchen. My grandma told me of her experiences with shadow people.<br />
My grandpa told me that he when he was a kid he always felt out of place inside his house and he would hear voices EVERYWHERES. My grandpa told me his mom would see things fling themselves around, And would be &quot;visited&quot; by &quot;ghosts&quot; at night.<br />
<br />
This is a story my grandpa told me:<br />
<br />
My grandpa&#039;s Mother would always be visited by a young girl while she tended to her garden, this girl would talk to his mom and they became very friendly with each other.<br />
At random points in a conversation this young girl would just vanish. My grandpa&#039;s mother got curious and started asking other people about this young girl (she had her name) my great grandmother was told by someone that the child that she spoke of had died years before she began to talk to her. She never spoke to this young girl again.<br />

Most of my experiences died down when I started to pratice Psionics.<br />

<br />
Personally the only time I can truly verify that I saw a ghost was when I was about 12 or 13. I was in the Boy Scouts at the time and we decided to stay the weekend in this one camp on an island. We slept in this one cabin and I was slept near the entrance. Early in the morning (the sun had barely peaked over the horizon) I saw this one figure (which I assume was a boy) by a ladder leading to the second floor. One of the creepy aspects about this encounter was that the &quot;boy&quot; had no facial features or any other sort of recognizable features whatsoever. I, being crazy person I am, started trying to talk to the &quot;boy&quot;. I got no response. However after a certain amount of time (I didn&#039;t have a watch) he started climbing up the ladder, and following him was this black snake-like thing. After they disappeared I was a bit freaked out. Oh BTW this took place on St. Patrick&#039;s Day.<br />
<br />
Immediately afterward I thought I saw another ghost, so I started talking to it too. Once more light entered the room I realized I was talking to a backpack that entire time. I told you I was crazy.<br />
<br />
Recently I haven&#039;t really seen any ghosts, but have had other weird things happen to me. Sometimes I would know where a particular guy is, and I would arrive at that place and he would be there. Sometimes I would say things that other people were thinking at the time, in a few cases taking the same exact words. I don&#039;t usually think much of them, because I have other more important activities to take part of.</div>

My father was talking to this guy who he works with. He had this house that he was renting, and the people kept moving out. They said it was haunted.

He goes in there, stands by the vanity mirror for a few minutes. Gets nothing. Is about to leave, and then there are these loud stomps across the floor towards him, and something blows in his ear.
