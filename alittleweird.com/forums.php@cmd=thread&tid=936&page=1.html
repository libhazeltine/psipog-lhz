I&#039;ve been returning to psipog alot lately, rereading articles and posts..<br />
Hell I&#039;m even reading the whole Q&amp;A, ALL OF IT (currently at page 38).<br />
I have to say the amount of people asking for electrokinesis or asking about cold baths and ice cube holding as a preliminary to cryokinesis is unsurprisingly high.<br />

Have you been stuck in this loop? Have you discarded psi?<br />

		<div id="post_16524" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I haven&#039;t been involved with psi that much, but an online friend of mine introduced me to the whole concept of it.  I started researching it, but she stopped logging on.  Now, years later, I&#039;m still interested in it and would like to know more, but she doesn&#039;t even really remember anything about it...  It&#039;s weird.  She has a really messed up home life though, so she&#039;s often distracted with all the events going on.<br />
<br />
Ever since I first read about psi and all the things related, I&#039;ve been more aware about everything.  I can notice how someone is feeling without them even saying anything or hinting (with body language).  I&#039;ve had lots of people tell me I&#039;m very observant and ask how I know what they&#039;re thinking.  Most of the time, I&#039;m not even trying, but sometimes I do try and slightly succeed.<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion, don&#039;t give up.  Even if you&#039;re not as involved with it as you used to be, I think just the knowledge about it is power towards you.  I think just knowing about it and knowing how to utilize it makes it more active within you as a person.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts...<br />

P.S. I think Psipog should be reopened. :)</div>

<br />
I don&#039;t really practice psionics anymore... so I don&#039;t have the opportunity to be stuck in a loop :-).<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really sure what you&#039;re asking, or if you&#039;re just looking for general guidance.<br />
<br />
I certainly plateaued in some skills.  With PK, I could only get a few twitches from a pen... I could never get past that.  I practiced PK for years, fairly consistently, but could only get small success.  I think a lot of people are like that.  My theories (at the time) were that different people actually performed PK through different mechanisms.  Perhaps there are a couple different ways to perform small scale PK (on a pinwheel)... ex: control over body heat, control over some form of magnetism, some other unknown mechanism, etc.  Perhaps some of us first acquired success by controlling body heat, and continued to focus on that skill... only to fail at moving larger objects.  Maybe others stumbled upon controlling magnetism first, and focused on that, which allowed them to grow further.  These different camps of individuals then come together, and claim the same label of &quot;PK&quot; - so we think everyone is doing the same thing.  But that&#039;s not necessarily true.  Again, I don&#039;t know, just some thoughts I used to have.<br />
<br />
OBEs I still experience to this day.  I don&#039;t care about them like I used to... I suppose it is quite &quot;amazing&quot;... I don&#039;t know.  It is very normal for me.  I&#039;ve been having them since I was 16 (so for 11 years now).  I can have them whenever I want.  I&#039;ve performed tests to see if I could verify the experiences were real, but I failed at the tests, which makes me question whether they are real or just some form of hallucination.  I suppose deep down I still believe they&#039;re real, but I couldn&#039;t figure out a way to pass the tests, so that bothers me.  Meh... perhaps some day I&#039;ll figure it out.<br />
<br />
What else?  RV I could do pretty reliably.  If I could do things over, I&#039;d probably focus on that more.  RV is the coolest.  Lots of effort though.<br />
<br />
Energy manipulation was always fun, but I lost interest.  Too subjective and hard to measure.  I had to touch one of my shields a couple of months ago, surprisingly.  Years ago I created a different kind of shield that would maintain itself... it works great.  Only had to touch it that one time since making it.<br />
<br />
The geiger counter was great - I think everyone who practices psionics should buy one.  They&#039;re about $150 I think.<br />
<br />
What else?  Subconscious communication.  Yeah, still do that.  Different ideas on what it actually *is*... but still do it, and it&#039;s very useful.<br />
<br />
Telepathy... meh.  I was never hugely interested in it.<br />
<br />
Empathy.  Heh, yeah, still do that.  Not the same way, but in another form.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
When I look over my development, I think the big theme is that: psionics is strange because it takes these normal/natural things, and labels them individually.  And individually, they sound magical and special... but really, they are normal.  Everyone does them (for the most part) all the time.  People just don&#039;t pull them out and label them.<br />
<br />
So for me, a lot of my development has been just relaxing on the labels.  Relaxing on the idea that one particular thing is empathy, and another is RV, and another an OBE.  It&#039;s just existence.  It&#039;s life.  It&#039;s living.  You know?<br />
<br />
You take in experiences, you make decisions (usually subconsciously), you discover more about yourself and the world around you... that&#039;s about it.  So yeah, that&#039;s a loop.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else you are looking for.  Don&#039;t take things so seriously.  It&#039;s important to be consistent and accurate in your reasoning about reality, but that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t be happy.  Relax.  Enjoy life.  Make the best decisions that you can... and when you screw up, don&#039;t beat yourself up, just learn and move on.  No big deal man.<br />

		<div id="post_16560" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Arzhul, I was never really a fixture around here or Psipog (I&#039;ve spent most of my time lurking), but perhaps you&#039;ll get something out of my experiences too.<br />
<br />
I started out practicing energy manipulation a long time ago, around the time Psiball Station was changing over to Psipog. I sort of fell in with people local to me who were interested in the paranormal, and we all talked about it and practiced our own things that appealed to us, and we kept each other going. Then we all had other life issues to take care of and psionics fell by the wayside for awhile.<br />
<br />
Then, maybe a few months to a year or so later, we&#039;d remind each other of psionics, and talk about how we viewed it, and practice a bit more, then peter out again. Eventually, I fell in with another group who was also interested in the paranormal, and began practicing and discussing it in earnest again. Learned some new things, but still felt stuck in a rut, even in my favorite area, energy manipulation. Eventually, it fell by the wayside again with needing to get serious about college.<br />
<br />
I should also mention that during this time, I&#039;d also tried to find ways of integrating psionics into my life, with inconsistent results.<br />
<br />
Finally, I came across two other communities, one interested in the paranormal, and one of open-minded Christians looking to explore energy healing and magic. Working with people in both communities has helped me finally, and only recently, come to a point where I found a system that works for me, an integration of magic and energy work that suits my tastes, and that I find easy to use in everyday life. No, it&#039;s nothing fancy, and certainly nothing I could ever prove, at least as far as I know. Which, frankly, isn&#039;t my concern right now (and I acknowledge it may be in my head too). My concern is that, for the moment, my practice of it makes my life better, in little ways that add up, and for now that&#039;s all I&#039;m looking for.<br />
<br />
Would I like to unlock the secrets of the universe? Of course! But it&#039;s not my life work, and it&#039;s not something I&#039;m anywhere close to, nor pursuing, because there are other things I want more. Instead, magic is a bit of a hobby, a belief, and a lifestyle now, but it took a long time to become that way, with lots of ups, downs, plateaus, and times when I just didn&#039;t look at it at all because life has a way of demanding your attention sometimes.<br />
<br />
So don&#039;t worry so much about where you are, everyone works at their own pace. Yeah, I still sometimes wonder what it would be like to have experiences like Sean or Rainsong, but I have my own toolbox to work with, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m focused on. I recommend you do the same, whatever that toolbox is for you.</div>

Then we all had other life issues to take care of and psionics fell by the wayside for awhile.

Then, maybe a few months to a year or so later, we&#039;d remind each other of psionics, and talk about how we viewed it, and practice a bit more, then peter out again. Eventually, I fell in with another group who was also interested in the paranormal, and began practicing and discussing it in earnest again. Learned some new things, but still felt stuck in a rut, even in my favorite area, energy manipulation. Eventually, it fell by the wayside again with needing to get serious about college.

I should also mention that during this time, I&#039;d also tried to find ways of integrating psionics into my life, with inconsistent results.

Finally, I came across two other communities, one interested in the paranormal, and one of open-minded Christians looking to explore energy healing and magic. Working with people in both communities has helped me finally, and only recently, come to a point where I found a system that works for me, an integration of magic and energy work that suits my tastes, and that I find easy to use in everyday life. No, it&#039;s nothing fancy, and certainly nothing I could ever prove, at least as far as I know. Which, frankly, isn&#039;t my concern right now (and I acknowledge it may be in my head too). My concern is that, for the moment, my practice of it makes my life better, in little ways that add up, and for now that&#039;s all I&#039;m looking for.

Would I like to unlock the secrets of the universe? Of course! But it&#039;s not my life work, and it&#039;s not something I&#039;m anywhere close to, nor pursuing, because there are other things I want more. Instead, magic is a bit of a hobby, a belief, and a lifestyle now, but it took a long time to become that way, with lots of ups, downs, plateaus, and times when I just didn&#039;t look at it at all because life has a way of demanding your attention sometimes.

So don&#039;t worry so much about where you are, everyone works at their own pace. Yeah, I still sometimes wonder what it would be like to have experiences like Sean or Rainsong, but I have my own toolbox to work with, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m focused on. I recommend you do the same, whatever that toolbox is for you.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
