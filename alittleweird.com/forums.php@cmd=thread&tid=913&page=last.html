		<div id="post_16375" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Last night was a rather interesting night. Actually, the experience didn&#039;t happen while on a dream, but during a bit of time in which I woke up randomly. Now, it had been a long time since I had those &quot;wake many times a night&quot; sort of thing that lead to many sleep paralysis, and last night was a small case of that. <br />
<br />
The important thing here is not the sleep paralysis. I woke up with my eyes closed, leaning to one side, I felt awake, definitely not a dream. I did not want to move, I don&#039;t even know if I was able to move, but suddenly I could see myself on the bed. I was half uncovered. I saw an entity standing behind me, facing my back, holding something which I figured to be a blanket or something. Dark blanket thing.. or something.<br />
<br />
At that time, just by seeing that entity I became sorta freaked, but I&#039;ve learned to stay calm (experiences with sleep paralysis), and quelled that freaked out feeling. I just thought to myself that the entity had no harmful thought against me and he was just going to lay that &quot;blanket&quot; looking thing on me.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the entity approached, and as the &quot;blanket&quot; was laid, I felt an outburst in tingly sensations and vibrations in my physical body, and then I was back in my body and soon afterward fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Not too sure what to make out of it.<br />
<br />
(and then I went onto dream about my cat, who&#039;s been gone for 4 days. Very hurt, with injuries that seemed real. The cat usually returned after 1 day or less. And I&#039;m not the type to worry, I usually think stuff like- &quot;eh, it&#039;ll come back eventually&quot; but after that dream, I&#039;m not so sure.)<br />

However, It could have still been a dream.There have been many times when people have thought they were awake, when actually they were dreaming.<br />
<br />
The dream would have to do with something in your life. (Duh!)<br />
<br />
Have you thought about different things it could represent or mean? Have you thought that your dream about your cat and that instance could be connected?<br />

<br />
As for the dream about your cat, even if you&#039;re not worrying... you&#039;ve noticed he&#039;s gone. Your subconscious is bound to create reasons, and that might come about in dreams. Just a thought. I hope your cat comes back! <br />
