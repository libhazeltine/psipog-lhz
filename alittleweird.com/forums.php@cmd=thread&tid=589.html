if you consider energy manipulation as a psionic skill, then i&#039;ll say i never started psionics with any websites. i learnt EM from my taichi lessons, and my training made me become proficient in EM. psipog.net was my second site where i learnt about psionics. i don&#039;t use any of the techniques mentioned there, but the articles really broadened my perspective on psionics.(that&#039;s why i think it&#039;s a great site.) as for my first site, the techniques were decent enough, but since it was designed to sell binaural beat tracks and other psionic stuff online, the techniques described depend heavily on binaural beats, and i don&#039;t have a credit card, so i can&#039;t buy and use these tracks. that&#039;s why i gave up visiting that site long ago.<br />
<br />
imo, the wingmakers site contains quite a lot of stuff that even fellow psions find hard to believe. e.g.opening your wings. i don&#039;t really know what for, really. plus, there are a lot of spelling errors in the site.<br />
<br />
p.s. i think  <a href="http://www.xtrememind.com/phpbb/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.xtrememind.com/phpbb/index.php</a> is a good forum site to find out about different psionic techiques, as well as radionics(the use of machines to help you in psionic practice or other psychic purposes).</div>I looked at the site...So what are they doing, selling stuff?<br />
