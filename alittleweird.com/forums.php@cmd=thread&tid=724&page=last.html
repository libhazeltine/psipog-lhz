And if it&#039;s a townhouse or single family home, how old is it? Before assuming it&#039;s due to psionics we have to ensure it&#039;s not something else. Homes crack all the time and when you are relaxed and in a more meditative state of mind you are more prone to picking up on the subtle sounds around you. The groans I&#039;m not so sure about, but when you first heard them, and since then, were/do you LOOK for them? If you are trying to hear something out of the &quot;ordinary,&quot; and you are meditating, than more than likely you&#039;re going to hear something out of the ordinary. <br />

I&#039;ve heard as well as seen somethings that I couldn&#039;t prove were attributed to other &quot;normal&quot; reasons. These things were experienced during other practices that weren&#039;t directly correlated with the general accepted definition of &quot;psionics&quot; though. So, I&#039;m not ruling out the possibility that you experienced some steller cool stuff, just trying to ensure you are taking a somewhat objective stance when it comes to first, new, or not common psionic experiences. Oh and one more question, what are you doing when you experience this? Psychokinesis, Telepathy, etc...? I&#039;m just curious because it might help to explain it better.</div>

I mean the practice it self was what propelled me along in my own pursuits but the ideas instilled within people because of the videos and the &quot;legacy&quot; I left behind is something I&#039;d rather not be in the forefront of peoples minds when they see me. But yeah, that&#039;s me. And Thank You :P<br />
<br />
As for the other stuff. You&#039;re practicing PK and this is occurring after meditation or while in a meditative state right? Well, if they are scary I&#039;m sure you could sort of push them into the background but because I don&#039;t know exactly what&#039;s going on it&#039;s hard to tell you what to do. Honestly, If I were in your shoes I would try to get into that state and actively seek out the noises and try to reach out and figure out what&#039;s going on. <br />
<br />
Though, in similar situations I&#039;ve had very odd, awkward, and at times dangerous and scary experiences to follow such things. So I guess just do whatever you feel you should :P Keep me posted on what happens because I&#039;m curious to know what exactly, if anything, is going on. I have my ideas but I&#039;d rather not have you practicing what some frontloaded with ideas of feelings or anything that you might create within yourself. Biofeedback is cool, and fun, but not when you&#039;re trying to figure stuff out.</div>

I am working towards being able to move bigger objects so I can prove it to my uncle.

		<div id="post_13554" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Heh. PK can be a cool tool to give you or someone else that wow factor. I think it would be more beneficial if you reevaluated your goals for it though. It takes a lot more motivation to stick with the practice if you&#039;re doing it for yourself, as opposed to doing it to prove it&#039;s existence to another person.<br />
<br />
Congrats on the success. Try to start using more affirmations to change the way in which you think, though. I&#039;ve found that size and weight is really only a factor in how we think, not how difficult it is to manipulate an object. If you get into the understanding that all matter shares the same components, and you do some more research into even basic quantum mechanics you learn that all religion or spirituality aside, we are all connected and composed of the same stuff. I have my own theories of how entanglement affects psionics, but I can honestly say that your results will drastically change if you convince yourself that the object sitting in front of you is no more separate from your thoughts, or intentions, than the fingers allowing you to reply to me. <br />
<br />
Takes awhile to get a handle on it, but from what I can see NI had it right the entire time. I don&#039;t fully agree with the way in which it was taught then, but his methodologies point to the right direction of understanding PK and how to do it effectively. If I were to try to instruct you, I&#039;d tell you to forget actively doing PK, and acting like it was something you had to practice. I would rather tell you to practice changing your perception on PK, Psionics, and the general world we live in. <br />
<br />
If you want some quick mind boggling quantum info... Watch this video:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc</a> <br />

It&#039;s not so much pointing towards what I said, but it&#039;s food for thought on how little we know about the world we live in. Enjoy :P</div>

Heh. PK can be a cool tool to give you or someone else that wow factor. I think it would be more beneficial if you reevaluated your goals for it though. It takes a lot more motivation to stick with the practice if you&#039;re doing it for yourself, as opposed to doing it to prove it&#039;s existence to another person.</div>Then again working under pressure over a craft that gives unbeliavably shaky results is not fun. At least from my experience.<br />
<br />
do A - it works<br />
do B - it works better<br />
do B - it woeks slightly worse<br />
do A - it does not work<br />
Stop trying - The bottle crashes through the window on the second you look away ^^<br />
<br />
All but the last step are from experience... :P</div>

		<div id="post_13580" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Kind of funny because it does seem to work like that when it comes to PK. Then it&#039;s sort of about finding that groove and staying inside of it. That&#039;s the stage where many give up. When I was into PK I took a different road then most after a year or so of average results. I moved onto things like ceiling fans and rocking chairs. The force to move them wasn&#039;t so great as to throw me off, yet the size was large enough to get me more accustomed to larger objects. This of course directly reflected my mindset at that time though. Back when I actually thought size, weight, and friction would make a substantial difference in results. *shrugs*</div>

		<div id="post_13597" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">LMAO... Spend a few more years raping the internet of it&#039;s knowledge and you&#039;ll be right up there with me :P. None of that is too out there, it&#039;s all pretty basic quantum stuff. I couldn&#039;t understand the actual numbers behind all of it if I was paid too. Partially due to my lack of patience in that department. I&#039;d tell you to look into some books though. Entangled Minds was okay. Stuff about the Unified Field Theory, etc... Just look around really, i&#039;m sure you can find tons of stuff. The hard part isn&#039;t finding it, it&#039;s what to do after you find it :P *flash back of pulling out hair and destroying the keyboard with his head*<br />
<br />
Thanks for the compliment though :)... I&#039;m writing a piece called &quot;The Science of Spirituality&quot; you might like. But that won&#039;t be done for a good week or two. Some debates are forcing me to move up other posts first... </div>
