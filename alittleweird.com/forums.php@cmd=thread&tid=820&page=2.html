well i think most ppl that claim to be vampires r just ppl who have gotten themselves to beleive they can drink blood some ppl even carve there teeth haha i was once in that state myself but im over it i was young(er) when that happened</div>While this may be the case with many people, especially those associated with the more recent incarnations of the &quot;goth&quot; subculture, after a few months of research, I think there are actually some legitimate &quot;vampires.&quot; Most of these legitimate (as they seemed to be to me) &quot;vampires&quot; were psychic or empathic vampires, feeding on energy, psi, chi, prana, or whatever you wish to call <em>it</em>. There were, however, some cases of sanguine vampirism (blood drinking) that seemed at least somewhat valid to me.<br />
But, just to go ahead and quite the myths, these people resemble societies ideas of vampires almost exclusively in their need and/or desire to feed. The advantages of vampirism, if any, are few and of minor effect, and the disadvantages seem to far out way them.<br />

Sounds like a good explanation :) As long as I don&#039;t go feral and run around biting people, I think I&#039;ll be alright...</div>On second thought, I take that back. Lately I&#039;ve felt a growing connections to the whole werewolf thing, the night, the moon, all of it. Maybe it was in another life, who knows... But what would I not do to get that feeling again... If I truly once felt it, that is. I&#039;ve been looking for excuses to go out at night recently...<br />

EDIT: Don&#039;t worry, tho, I&#039;m not planning on become a sadistic sociopath :P The feeling came more from the whole experience than the hunt...</div>

Yeah having a werewolf friend is kinda fun, when you&#039;re aware of it, I guess :P And that girl has one freaky ability! Gotta say, it sounds pretty cool to be able to say a word and a fire pops up :O<br />
<br />
A little update on my friend&#039;s story: I showed her tha article and everything and she was like &quot;Yeah, I know I&#039;m a lycanthrope =)&quot; She just thought talking about it seriously might get people to think she was crazy, so she decided to use it as a joke when around others. Seems she&#039;s been aware of being a werewolf for some time then o.o<br />
<br />
Talking about this makes me think about a dream I used to have... You know those dreams that, when you wake up, you feel like you would give anything to go back... (Usually for me they&#039;re love stories or the like) But when I was younger (around 8 I guess) I would have this dream, I called it the red dream, because I saw only in shades of red. Anyway, in that dream, I was walking on all fours and running around in the street, hunting down people... It most probably means nothing, &#039;cause I have an insane amount of imagination, but it was one of those dreams that feel so real and when I woke up... I wanted to go back, the same way you&#039;d want to go back to a happy dream. I was surprised to remember this dream after so many years, but now that I think of it, isn&#039;t it strange that I wanted to go back to this primal urge of hunting? O_O Maybe it was just my crazy lil mind after playing too many video games, though xD</div>wow i have dreams like that all the time my most recent is quit simular. i was joining a werewolf clan and i fell in love with on of the others. the part i most remeber was when i was running down a street hunting and fighting i have never felt the most power in my ife &gt; :D i loved it !! it sucked when i woke up tho.   i used to have alot of nightmares that werent scary at all but when i woke up in the middle of the night i nwas teriffied. wierd <br />

<br />
So I&#039;m in the perfect conditions to experiment this weekend:<br />
<br />
1. My parents are out to the cottage up north &#039;til Sunday, along with my little brothers.<br />
2. My big brother works night shifts at the Casino, so he&#039;s not a problem.<br />
<br />
So I decided to try it out and go walk outside tonight. It wasn&#039;t much use, the Moon is low on the horizon still and it&#039;s all orange, &#039;cause of the city lights on the other side of the river. But I thought, &quot;Hey, I&#039;ve had the urge to move objects with my mind and stuff and when I gave in and let it go with the flow, it happened. So why ignore these urges?&quot; So I walked outside, there are open fields behind my house, I had a good spot. Nothing much happened, except for feeling strange while looking up at the Moon after a while. Then I realized, I&#039;m next to the greenway and there are still people on bikes passing by, looking at me strange, so I started walking back. Then I had that idea: In the dream, I was running, right? So what the hell, I&#039;ll jog and see what happens. I was trying to calm down like during meditation and suddenly, about halfway back, I saw this white flash. It wasn&#039;t lightning,as there was no thunder, and the flash covered my entire vision. Now, remember, I was in a meditative state, not paying attention to what I was doing. Next thing I know, &#039;m running hunched over. Not jogging anymore, but running full speed. It took only a few seconds before I was running along the street, so I calmed down and starting walking again, as I didn&#039;t want a car driver to see me and think I might be running from something, especially in that weird pose. It was only midnight, so maybe too early. I&#039;m going back and this time, I&#039;ll try some more ideas I&#039;ve had. Let&#039;s hope the moon goes higher and there aren&#039;t clouds later tonight... Just wanted to let you guys now, as this subject&#039;s caused lots of talking in the thread ;) I&#039;ll update ya on it later. (I might just be going crazy, too :P)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Meh, I can&#039;t see it anymore... Checked on a site, It&#039;s way down the horizon by now.. Summer isn&#039;t a good time to watch the Moon, I guess XD Maybe tomorrow, if I go out earlier.</div>

Sounds to me like ya almost turned werewolfien. Truly interesting.</div>Yup, guess what, my older bro&#039;s out tonight! lol... Anyway, yeah, it was weird. We&#039;ve got to remember, though, that P-Shifters (Physical-Shifters) are very rare. Most werewolves are actually Therianthropes, meaning their minds switch to an animal&#039;s when they &quot;shift&quot; (Kinda like the lycanthrope from that text) We&#039;ll just have to wait and see I guess...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s too bad, though, during this part of year, the Moon isn&#039;t visible for long each night. And I don&#039;t think I need to explain why it would be tough to go running outside at night in Canada during winter :P<br />
<br />
UPDATE: So I went for a second try. Nothing happened this time, though. Maybe I was too conscious of my goal? Anyway, I did get the urge to start running at some point and eventually went up to a sprint, but nothing more except maybe the posture again, but I&#039;m not sure if it was the same as last time. I&#039;m too self-conscious, I think. I&#039;m afraid someone will pass by and see me. I could try doing it by simple meditation. I&#039;ve heard about some Shifters doing that, but... well the guy ended up passing out because the feeling was too intense XD Anyway, I have a whole week to try again in two weeks&#039; time, so we&#039;ll just see what happens then. Oh, and my rantings about the Moon? Stupid, truly stupid. I was going out too late. I didn&#039;t realize the Moon is high around 10PM and not 1AM this time o year... Oh well, I&#039;ll know next time... (I can find the link to that guy&#039;s story again, if ya like)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I&#039;m trying to contact the guy, I&#039;ll let ya know what happens. (Trying to contact a pack I found on an abandoned website, too... It&#039;s been 10 years, though, maybe they don&#039;t even use those emails anymore...)</div>
