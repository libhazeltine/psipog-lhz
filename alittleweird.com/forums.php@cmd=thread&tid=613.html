I&#039;m going straight to the source: my problem in training psionic skills is keep practicing for a long time.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been starting psionics for almost 2 years, but I never get to the level of results, I&#039;ve always found myself quiting from it, due to loss of motivation and coming of new ideas to my mind that made me forget psionics and the training that&#039;s necessary to achieve results.<br />
<br />
This really angers me because I really want to learn psionics and I know perfectly what my problem is, I just can&#039;t fix it, I just can&#039;t find a solution.<br />

From your experience, can you help me?<br />
Don&#039;t blame me for not being able to reach it, this is a big big problem, and I don&#039;t recommend for those who never experienced this.<br />

I myself have the same problem. I get distracted easily. There are two methods I use. The first is meditation. Simple and to the point. If you can clear your mind and keep it that way for extended periods, focusing on your practice is cake. The other one is to only practice for like five minutes at a time, but a lot more often. This works great for me, because it fits my daily activities a lot better, plus it keeps me from getting bored. I can&#039;t guarantee that it&#039;ll work for you, and I recommend the meditation over the split practices, but that&#039;s just because meditation is useful on its own.</div>

Hi to everyone!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going straight to the source: my problem in training psionic skills is keep practicing for a long time.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been starting psionics for almost 2 years, but I never get to the level of results, I&#039;ve always found myself quiting from it, due to loss of motivation and coming of new ideas to my mind that made me forget psionics and the training that&#039;s necessary to achieve results.<br />
<br />
This really angers me because I really want to learn psionics and I know perfectly what my problem is, I just can&#039;t fix it, I just can&#039;t find a solution.<br />
<br />
From your experience, can you help me?<br />
Don&#039;t blame me for not being able to reach it, this is a big big problem, and I don&#039;t recommend for those who never experienced this.<br />
<br />
By the way, is this website dead? because the last posts of the other threads were made weeks and months ago, and that troubles me.<br />
<br />

<br />
I share a similar problem, and I&#039;m really starting to lose motivation. I&#039;ve been practicing on and off for years with absolutely no result to the point where it is depressing. I think my main problem is that I cannot meditate properly; I&#039;ve seen the videos and read millions of guides, but I can&#039;t shut my mind up. I also have trouble doing something without a tangible, definite way to practice. Everything about psionics is indefinite, other than the fact that it exists. I&#039;m beginning to think I&#039;ll never see a result. But I&#039;m a determined individual, so I won&#039;t stop trying.<br />
<br />
My main goal is the whole communicating with your subconscious thing as well as any form of perception (I&#039;m not that interested in manipulation). What do you all recommend I do to develop these types of things?<br />
<br />
In addition, do any you think that it is possible for a human being to be completely unable to develop psionic skills? Cause I&#039;m starting to believe I am one of those people.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone here.<br />

You might start thinking: &quot;And what about my body!?? Yes I can control it it is ME. Then and what&#039;s around me? Am not I a waterdrop in this big lake which is the world?
