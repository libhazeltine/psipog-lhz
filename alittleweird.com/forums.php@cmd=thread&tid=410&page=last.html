		<div id="post_9089" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I have found that meditation increases my ablities as well. As for time, well, make time, add it into your day. For example, I sometimes find myself semi-meditating while I drive, paying attention to nothing but the road and my car, feeling the speed and focusing on the power of it all. The dashed lines on a road provide a great &quot;beat&quot; as you pass them at a constant rate, just like feeling your heartbeat, but visual. I am sure that this is probably not a great thing to do...I just do it naturally.<br />
<br />
I have also used candle meditation, it is rather simple. Just light a candle and focus on the flame, as a bright and shining point, all that matters. It sounds strange, but it most definately clears my mind.<br />
<br />
My favorite thing to do though is to just move energy. I start by drawing it to my hands and then just play it throughout my body. Again, rather simple and basic, but an awesome feeling that gives you a sense of the power you hold. I know that for me this works better than just trying to focus on nothing. Drawing up the energy and then feeling it move and moving it naturally clears the mind. I don&#039;t know that this counts as meditation, but I consider it to be because it gives the same results as meditation plus an additional awareness, and it improves all of my psionic abilities, particuarly work with the psi wheel.</div>

In another explenation to cinderwild :<br />
If you read this words without repeat them in our head ,<br />
 than you are in focus (=the nothing you think in meditation ).<br />
<br />
for example: <br />
know those times when you read a book, and suddenly realize you read more than you noticed and didn&#039;t understood nothing of that reading? that&#039;s &quot;think of nothing&quot; <br />
<br />
Tip: when you meditate, anything that run to your mind, say to it &quot; I&#039;ll handle you later, bye now&quot; . after few eventrully all of them will disapear.<br />
<br />
Good luck :P  <br />

for example: 
know those times when you read a book, and suddenly realize you read more than you noticed and didn&#039;t understood nothing of that reading? that&#039;s &quot;think of nothing&quot; 

Tip: when you meditate, anything that run to your mind, say to it &quot; I&#039;ll handle you later, bye now&quot; . after few eventrully all of them will disapear.

Good luck :P</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

&quot;What is your favorite method?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, the type of meditation I use most of the time, is a no-mind meditation.<br />
Basically,  not thinking or feeling in any way at all; very similar to the border of sleeping and waking, or when you &quot;click out&quot;.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been doing it for a while now, so it&#039;s easier for me to just go straight into it in a calm environment.<br />
<br />
The method I used though, since I was in the middle of forest, was to listen to the sounds of birds and animals around me..  slowly cutting out each group, until I only noticed one group of chirps.  Then finally, cut that group out too.<br />
<br />
After that, I just hold it until I come out.<br />
The point of no-mind is what you could consider &quot;pure&quot; meditation. The other parts, where you still feel etc, is still meditation, but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a pure state personally.</div>

Ofcourse, you should realise that sometimes you can skip processess in your body to make it run more efficiently. i.e. when you breathe, you don&#039;t have any concience thought in the breathing you are doing because the thing you are doing is taking up more space.<br />
<br />
To make an anology to computers, sometimes certain aspacts of process aren&#039;t completed to their fullest because the processess running take up to much RAM.<br />
<br />
Ussually if a process cannot fully complete itself, there is an error. In the case of your body, this error notification is your body telling you &quot;hey... you&#039;re not breathing... you should really take breath...Now...COME ON MAN!!! DON&#039;T QUIT ON ME!!! BREATHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; and so on.<br />
<br />
OFcourse... there is always the fatal error if you don&#039;t breath, either passing out (rebooting) or death (shut down).<br />

My favorite meditation method consists on focusing in my body&#039;s energy flux and visualizing that my energy is getting amplified each time I breath. The effects are that my energy becomes stronger and the my energetic sensibility increases. I do this meditation often when I&#039;m going to practice psychokinesis.</div>
