I have Swim team practice in the mornings from 6:00 to 7:30, I then have to go home and get ready because at 8:30 I have to be at my high school for summer classes because I had a grand scheme for an early graduation. I finally get off a 1:30, at which Time I am supposed to, but haven&#039;t been working for 3 hours a day so I can save up for a controller I want to buy so I can build an arcade machine, and to top it all off, on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have to leave for the city pool again at 5 so I can help set up for a meet, which usually lasts until about 11:00 to 11:30. So it&#039;s a bit of a hassle and my energy levels have suffered from the stress...</div>

		<div id="post_9597" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Considering the definition of psychic vampire is someone who drains energy from people, I really don&#039;t see that you could naturally be able to drain energy from people and not be a vampire. If you were wondering if the definition of a psychic vampire is to drain blood and energy from people simultaneously, then I have to say that this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Usually Psychic Vampires have a few symptoms,but the main one is a damaged or corrupt aura. This is a result of the draining process, in which one takes the energy through the links that one would create for empathy and telepathy, and stores it in himself. When you do this, you are also taking the emotions and thoughts of that person (i.e. their aura) and combining it with your own. When you do this, it usually causes a chaotic aura that can give the person other side effects like depression or mood swings.<br />
<br />
after studying this further, I found two useful things that one can do with such an aura. One is a technique called wiping, and the other is a simple way to prevent the damaged aura effect from happening.<br />
<br />
Wiping is basically flaring ones aura in a directed manner, or in other words extending the aura as a form of attack, particularly useful in battles. <br />
<br />
The method that can be used to prevent the aura damage in the first place is to store energy one has drained from another in a location that is separate from the body, sch as in a gemstone or object of interest. In history, I believe the older, wiser Vamps tended to do this to increase normal energy levels.<br />

Sorry, I&#039;m getting carried away. Actually, there are Psy vamps that drain energy from others on a day to day basis without realizing or paying attention to it. This is what people tend to call an unconscious psy vamp, and it stems from the Idea of Awakening. I have gone through this process but I feel I cannot share any more with you on this matter, due to certain rules in which I have to abide to.</div>

		<div id="post_9722" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Psy vamps may have vampire teeth, but it is not necessary. We really don&#039;t require it to feel well but we can use it in that way... For example, I don&#039;t take energy from anyone unless I need it at that moment, this prevents my aura from being damaged by their energy, and still allows me the use of it. We can use it to make us stronger or faster, for a short period of time, but we usually use meditation in the process. Just as in any form of energy manipulation, you can direct it into certain area&#039;s to get the effect you desire.<br />
<br />
Also, other key things to consider. People say that if a baby is born with teeth, that person is a vampire, keep in mind that the origin of the blood vampire may very well have links to energy vampires because historically people believed that blood was the source of life, or your life energy. This reference keyed in with exaggeration inevitably developed the classic blood vampire along with Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula. <br />
<br />
In my knowledge, the only reason we separate the two is to preserve the duality of the matter. With that being said, I don&#039;t think there should be a difference between the two ^_^. </div>

The problem is is that in group practice, there are too many variables, and is single practice, there is only one witness<br />

Today the Geiger counter spiked at 107 thanks to group effort...but there are to many variables to accurately say something conclusive.<br />
<br />
I think that we should get into psionic testing here on the site... maybe a webcam with live feed to an object of interest, in which we could move? Some more things to do in the Games area that would all be hooked up to the same gabbly chat so we could all keep in contact during practice.<br />
<br />
This way we can expand as a community, and I can gather data for my book?<br />

Blood used to be considered (for a few obvious reasons) as ones energy and life force. So when people reffered to &quot;having their blood drained&quot; it meant that they were attacked by a psychic vampyre and had their energy drained.<br />
<br />
As humanity evolved and lost the need for psychic abilities, The Blood Vampire took on a unique role in fiction and horror.<br />
<br />
Acctually, I have a Friend (also a vampire, also a high ranking local coven member) told me that it&#039;s really not the blood, but rather the emotion in the blood that a Psychic vampire feeds off of. This could relate to Emotions being created in the brain, but I&#039;m not sure.<br />
<br />
Too be more specific, there are two types of vampire. One that requires blood, and one that does not. Those that do not require blood feed off of the emotion (and thoughts) by draining via a psychic linking process (the same as used for telepathy or empathy). The ones that use the blood use the chemicals created in the brain that cause emotion, and take it out via ingestion of the blood.<br />
<br />
Now, I think that the more powerful of the two vampires tends to be the Psychic ones because they do not require any blood to get the effect. Although the Blood vampire might have a stronger reaction, they have other things to deal with (disease, for example...).<br />
<br />
Therefore I do, in effect feel that blood vampires exist, but that for the most part they are an exaggeration of the Psychic Vampire</div>
