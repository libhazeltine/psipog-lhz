		<div id="post_7411" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">im checking out those links zectra posted, they seem interesting. you can also put me down as being interested in the monroe torrent.<br />
<br />
<br />
i tried a bunch of these (no i-doser, mostly just stuff from the sbagen pack) with varying results. since theta was the topic at hand i stuck with that for about a week or two, each night before bed.<br />
<br />
i noticed as i had been using it that my chronic neck/shoulder pain became less bothersome. it didnt go away, but it did lighten up more often than usual. this could be do to lots of things, but it seemed to coincide with the theta usage. i also noticed that i seemed to be swaying back into a more positive/spiritual mindset, but again, it wasnt dramatic and could have been due to many things. it should also be noted that i started with sbagen&#039;s theta, but when the links were posted to kl3z&#039;s vids (the ones with fractals) i ended up downloading and using his theta, since it was easier on the ears with the background &quot;music&quot;.<br />
<br />
since i was enjoying theta, i decided id give sbagen&#039;s &quot;drop&quot; sequences a try. ive been doing them for a few days now, and ive noticed my neck is bothering me a bit more again. when doing the drop sessions they feel pretty darn good (i do them before bed like i did theta) and i have to think that if i am to work through all of them 00-99 that it could certainly be beneficial for me, but right now im considering going back to just theta since it felt like there was tangible results.<br />
<br />
ill update more later as i play with stuff and give the stuff zectra linked a shot.</div>

<br />
Being in the theta state of mind has a lot of.. interesting results, you could say; the results are a lot broader than you might think.<br />
I recently, about three days ago, got into an accident and wore/tore a lot of muscles along my neck and spine.  Since I was going to be confined to my bed for a couple weeks anyway, I decided to explore more of the hemi-sync audio&#039;s and theta(Focus 10).  When I came out of my trance, my pain had significantly lessened from what it was before, as well as I had a more optimistic mindset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Delimew:<br />
Actually, there are 43 MP3s and one .doc file(The manual that comes with it.)<br />
These -are- true (copies of..) audio&#039;s as well.  I&#039;ll let you experience that on your own though.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve uploaded the torrent to:    <a href="http://rs371.rapidshare.com/files/101525524/Hemi-Sync_-_Complete_Gateway_Experience__mininova_.torrent" target="_blank">http://rs371.rapidshare.com/files/101525524/Hemi-Sync_-_Complete_Gateway_Experience__mininova_.torrent</a><br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t know how to use rapidshare, simply hit the free button under the free section of the table on that page, wait, put the code into the box, and press the download button that should be to the right of it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure how many are seeding this right now, but when I started it, there were plenty..   however if you find that it&#039;s going to take too long to download, tell me, and I can upload the waves separately to rapid or gigeshare.<br />

having switched back to theta for a few days now i can say i honestly notice a difference. i wouldnt call it dramatic, but i would call it perceivable.<br />

- my TK didn&#039;t preformed better ( spinning a paper on a string) .<br />
maybe because a lack of focus from not meditating that time.<br />

- I can mention that my TK practice is based on few minuets of silence before acting ( meditate ) and not by BB tracks, so maybe I&#039;m not used to it. <br />

Here&#039;s a tip as well, guys: The binaural beat takes effect after 5 minutes. It takes 5 minutes for your brain to &#039;sync&#039; to the BB (The &quot;...OH!&quot; part.). And the rest of the BB is the moving of brainwaves. (-:</div>
