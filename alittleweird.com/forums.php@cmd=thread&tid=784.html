		<div id="post_14298" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So I woke up at 8:00AM (I merely opened my eyes just to see the time) and went back to sleep.I had a dream that I&#039;m in the living room,watching American Idol (Actually it&#039;s Music Idol over here because I&#039;m not living in America :P) and I sat on the computer to look at pictures of the contestants.I was browsing trough pictures and suddenly I was in the hall plucking my eyebrows in front of the mirror (In dreams change of scenery happens often).When I was done I was back in the living room (I didn&#039;t pay attention to the TV that was still on).I was standing straight in the center of the room, reflecting on my plucking session.I suddenly realized that one of my eyebrows was really messed up and I became lucid.I OBE&#039;d and saw myself lying in bed (It didn&#039;t freak me out)I was kinda still in the dream while being out of body when I saw myself sleeping.(My OBE position was standing on my knees in bed)I suddenly thought to myself &quot;ok!STOP!&quot;.&quot;I need to think out,analyze and plan where I should go now&quot;.As soon as I did that I felt a sharp lower back pain as if someone was poking my kidney.I fell back in my body, and without moving a muscle I tried to OBE.I floated a few inches up from my body but then the sharp pain came again, forcing me to return.I changed my position from lying on my stomach to lying on my back, but I was already too awake for another round.I got up very disappointed and checked the time - it was 09:15AM.My dream lasted about a few minutes while the two OBEs couldn&#039;t have lasted more than 30 seconds each.<br />
I really need to do something about this pain,it&#039;s ruined all my OBEs so far.I&#039;m not sure why is it happening only when I try to OBE, but I have 3 theories:<br />
<br />
1.Could have happened because I forced myself to analyze every bit of the OBE.<br />
2.Could be the &quot;silver string&quot; tied to my kidney :/<br />
3.Could be the vibrations Robert Monroe has had every night, allowing him to OBE.<br />
<br />
But they are all wrong.<br />
<br />
1.Negative, I wasn&#039;t thinking of anything when I floated up (my second try)<br />
2.Negative, the string couldn&#039;t be that short.In my second OBE I was only a few inches up from my body<br />
3.Negative, it didn&#039;t feel like a vibration and the pain was only in the right of my lower back.And even if it&#039;s the vibrations when I OBE, it&#039;s too strong and I can&#039;t focus on anything else.<br />
I need to figure out why it&#039;s happening and how to stop it.Ideas?</div>

Maybe you could try to &quot;heal&quot; your kidney. The problem might be somewhere else though..<br />

My recommendation to you is to become very very very passive.  Be analytical after the experience ends.  Be in the state of, &quot;hum de dum... what will happen next?  oh isn&#039;t that nice, I have pain... dup de doo... oh now I&#039;m floating... &quot; etc.  As if you&#039;re watching a boring movie.<br />

It&#039;s just that reacting to the pain is a reflex.It&#039;s almost a subconscious reaction and I really can&#039;t control it.The feeling is not like a headache or stomach pain, it makes you twitch .......Just like if you&#039;ve been electrocuted.<br />
