Actually no. Being a lazy noob is what he does in his life. But then again, knowing what he does will help find his meaning of life.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was once this young man who loved philosophy. He took philosophy throughout his high school and college years. Whenever his professor was done lecturing, he would always ask if there were any questions. The young man would always stand up and ask what the meaning of life was. Everyone always laughed at him, but he never failed to ask the question. Still, his professors would never answer him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One time, he went to listen to one of this famous philosopher&#039;s lectures.&quot;(Don&#039;t remember his name) After the Philosopher was finished, the young man stood and asked his question. &#039;What is the meaning of life?&#039; The Philosopher turned away and the young man thought he wouldn&#039;t answer. Then, the Philosopher turned around, holding a glass shard. <br />
<br />
&#039;When me and my brother were little, we had nothing.&#039; The philosopher said. &#039;No toys, and barely any food. One day we found a glass shard, and we thought it was the coolest thing ever. We found that we could use it to reflect light in small places. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re meaning of life, but this is mine.&#039; he held up the shard. &#039;To shine light in dark corners.&#039;&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard this at my oldest brother&#039;s graduation, four years ago. I just now remembered it.<br />
<br />
I think this is what first got me interested into philosophy.<br />

		<div id="post_8743" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I feel that there is no true meaning of life. It&#039;s just the general will to survive that issues us to press on. Devine will or not, you can&#039;t assign any meaning to life as a whole because we lack information to make a valid hypothesis. So far, what I have seen is people explaining the meanings of their live&#039;s, rather that life as a whole. The fact of the matter is, the closest we can get without finding another &quot;lively&quot; world is the meaning of life on earth. <br />
<br />
I feel that the meaning of life on earth is to keep the balance. namely, one life form changes the atmosphere so that another lifeform can survive in that atmosphere, this lifeform then produces the gas that the first life form required to live. <br />
<br />
We can&#039;t say that life has any universal meaning because we don&#039;t know of other life forms existence besides those on our planet.<br />
<br />
I think that the main goal of any life is survival. I think this is why we have an instinctual fear of death, however; because we can rid ourselves of this inherent fear of death, we cannot say that survival is the meaning of life.<br />
<br />
We cannot say that the meaning of life is to be a test of worthyness for the next world because, besides creating a paradox,We would have to gain more knowledge on the religeous level and celear out confusion.

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_8743">I feel that there is no true meaning of life. It&#039;s just the general will to survive that issues us to press on. Devine will or not, you can&#039;t assign any meaning to life as a whole because we lack information to make a valid hypothesis. So far, what I have seen is people explaining the meanings of their live&#039;s, rather that life as a whole. The fact of the matter is, the closest we can get without finding another &quot;lively&quot; world is the meaning of life on earth. 

I feel that the meaning of life on earth is to keep the balance. namely, one life form changes the atmosphere so that another lifeform can survive in that atmosphere, this lifeform then produces the gas that the first life form required to live. 

We can&#039;t say that life has any universal meaning because we don&#039;t know of other life forms existence besides those on our planet.

Also, I have a (slightly rhetorical) question: If someone told you what the supposed meaning of life is, do you honestly think that you would live by it without question?

I know that I&#039;m too free spirited and stubborn to believe what people want me to believe, so I can honestly say that my answer would be a strong &quot;No.&quot; I just want to hear some opinions.

As for the other arguments, I really don&#039;t have anything to say at the moment.
