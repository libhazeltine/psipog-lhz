The problem with the Idea of Psi is your putting multiple effects into the same Category and generalizing to much... When you do things like that, you don&#039;t make yourself credible, in fact the opposite is true.<br />
<br />

Radioactive decay is different from Psi in the method in which it was discovered. First we discovered the Effect in which Radioactivity caused decay in the atomic structure of an atom which in turn cause the atom to change element (note; this is a very loose description). It was THEN elaborated on by the further elaboration of it&#039;s effects.<br />
<br />
Because Psi is a mechanic, not an effect itself. We have to do this process in reverse. Meaning that we have to find all of the subsystems and variables before we can accurately classify it as the master set psi or any other master set (meaning that it is possible that everything we are doing is not related to psi and rather turns to the Idea that Psi is false, and there is no mechanic, or at least it is caused by something already defined as something else)<br />

To find an accurate description of what psi is, we must abandon the Idea that Psi is Relative. This allows us to further our knowledge in a subject without bias.<br />

I&#039;m just saying that we need to stop using it so generally. I don&#039;t agree with the end statement in parenthesis just because of my thirst for knowledge.<br />
<br />
I think that we should keep the definition, but abandon it in explanation in order to further our knowledge of the subject.<br />
<br />
Granted, for teaching, sometimes having a master set is helpful. Needed? No, but helpful for the teacher.<br />
<br />
In reality, half the time we don&#039;t know what the fuck (excuse the language ^.^) we&#039;re actually experiencing, so we tend to describe it one of the two ways.<br />
<br />
1.) We generalize the effect as Psi and move on, not taking any time to really examine what it is (excluding rooting out key issues such as wind and the like).<br />
<br />
2.) We describe the feeling of it through your own body, the reactions, etc. In this we tend not to have any doubt in the experience (which leads to possible corruption of information), which allows us to elaborate, but at a risk of fallacious information.<br />
<br />
Both of these lead us to discreditably in the eyes of the scientific community, who, lets face it, control a good portion of the general public&#039;s opinion.<br />
<br />
I think that when we experience something, we need to explain things differently so that anyone looking down upon the information can understand it from the scientific viewpoint simply because of the above fact. This is, of course, if the goal is to try and prove the existence of Psi and the possibility of Tk along with everything else.<br />
<br />
If I were to give a guide for this type of explanation, I would say the following;<br />
<br />
Try to explain things in a feeling sort of way, along with the objective physical effects that have gone on, the facts, without any mention of unknowns such as psi (because psi is a hypothesis in the scientific community and basing a hypothesis off of a hypothesis then you will lose any credibility one would hope to gain from the statement). Then, you need to state any other variables that could have had an effect on the situation.<br />
<br />
Now... Some people already follow this example here, and I&#039;m glad to see that, because it allows for good information that can be easily elaborated on. You are saying that Psi simplifies things? I think quite the opposite, but then again, it seems we&#039;re trying to reach different goals?<br />
<br />
From the standpoint of a mentalist, I would say that your goal here is to try to keep the explanations simple for you so that you can further your progress in the field of psionics. i.e. You really want to achieve something like full out macro pk, and although you have achieved things such as energy manipulation and, from my guess, empathy at a small to medium degree, you feel that this really isn&#039;t enough for you and that you&#039;ve hit a roadblock with pk.<br />
<br />
I would also guess that you have made a little progress with a psi wheel (that was out in open air) and unverifiable effects with other objects where it looked a little like the objects moved but you really weren&#039;t sure, these objects were probably like paperclips, but I&#039;m not sensing anything as big as a pencil...<br />
<br />
Where as my goals are different, I wish not to improve my skills until I fully understand what&#039;s behind them. I mean, yes I do practice the effects, but for me, it&#039;s all hit and miss until I know the mechanics behind it.<br />
<br />
In effect, we do have the same end goal. The only difference is I&#039;m looking for the light switch and you&#039;re feeling around the room, we&#039;re both looking for the key to tk, but we&#039;re looking in different ways.<br />
<br />
You see what I mean?<br />

		<div id="post_9956" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">&quot;Measuring Psi&quot; is one of the great challenges we face in the scientific investigation of psionics. <br />
<br />
One factor is that &quot;Psi&quot; is a blanket term that is used in various ways that are not always &quot;quantitative.&quot;  One person will talk about &quot;needing more psi&quot; while another will state that &quot;it was psi that did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As was mentioned previously in this thread, how &quot;psi&quot; behaves is multi-faceted and is very difficult to standardize.<br />
<br />
Personally, I regard &quot;psi&quot; in the same I regard &quot;wind.&quot;   There is no &quot;wind&quot; as a thing.  It is moving air.  We measure wind by how it affects another instrument or object.  We can measure the speed, the pressure and the density of air and that gives us indicators to how waves on the ocean nad the patterns of weather and such behave.<br />
<br />
From my research, I have reasons to believe that &quot;psi&quot; is simply the observed effect of another more fundamental system of energy making changes to the physical.  I feel it&#039;s safe to say that &quot;psi&quot; is not a special energy all its own but as air in motion becomes wind, this energy put to action becomes what we call &quot;psi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without going in to too much detail, research indicates that the energy at work here is potential energy stored in the environment (universe).  Pressure on this energy (scalars) creates stress energy (potential) that can be programmed with information (thought) to do work.<br />
<br />
I have secretly been working on a unit of measure for &quot;psi.&quot;  It&#039;s okay enough for my work but it definitely needs a lot more refinement to be useful to others.  It&#039;s a unit of measure for &quot;psi influence&quot; on a measured quantity of material.<br />
<br />
The point of reference is a sphere of platinum-iridium alloy suspended by a wire from an axis two feet from a table surface.<br />
<br />
The material is very pure and consistent.  If indeed my theories are true that PK is a passive effect that interacts with an object&#039;s material rather than an active force that &quot;pushes&quot; an object, the sphere will require a consistent amount of &quot;influence&quot; to move it a specific distance.  A laser measures the degree of movement and that corresponds so the amount of &quot;influence&quot; &quot;psi&quot; has over the object.  Thus far tests have been positive.<br />
<br />
In my mind, &quot;psi&quot; as a “stuff” is only present with energy manipulation and psychokinesis.  Telepathy, empathy and other thought-based skills work purely on an information level and are not related to &quot;psi&quot; as a substance; basically the distinction of Psi-Kappa and Psi-Gamma.<br />
<br />
&quot;Psi&quot; as a classification encompasses it all, but it not measurable as such.  It&#039;s just a classification.<br />
<br />
My method for measurement seems to be consistent enough for PK measurement.  It has an unchanging reference point and seems to be repeatable between testers.  I have a tentative designation of &quot;PKI&quot; for &quot;unit of psychokinetic influence.&quot;  I used platinum-iridium alloy because it is directly related to the determination of the International Prototype Kilogram.  Though material densities differ, with marginal accuracy I can weigh an object in kilograms, measure its dimensions, estimate its volume and know how many &quot;PKI&#039;s of influence&quot; are needed to move it before resistance.  <br />
<br />
The interesting component here is that a &quot;field of influence&quot; comes in to affect.  Roughly calculated it takes 1pki of influence to get 180g of platinum-iridium to travel 1cm in one second; but only if you envelop the entire object with influence.  If you are &quot;tugging&quot; on only a small portion of the object you will need much more influence to move it.  The same goes the other way.  If the object weighs the same but is larger in volume (is less dense) it will take far less total influence to move provided you can distribute the influence across the entire object.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s very neat stuff.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m working with some colleagues to fix some of the broken math and hopefully have a usable standard by year&#039;s end.<br />
<br />
Now this is all well and good for PK but what about energy manipulation?  Well, at the moment, we can only measure what is interacting with physicality.  Once energy interacts with the physical it has become psychokinesis.<br />
<br />
I’m working on a way to measure how energy in energy manipulation behaves by creating physical fields that are modulated by the energy passing through them or around them but for obvious reasons that is much more difficult.<br />
<br />
My goal with PKI is to give us a physically grounded way to measure PK influence in a reliable way.  I think it achieves that.  The next (big) step is to see how energy manipulation like constructs, shields and such can be “measured” using understood and reliable reference points.  But we have to leave the physical to examine that.<br />
<br />
While PKI gives us a reference of physical effect, it still doesn’t give us insight into the energy used to fuel PK as well as other skills and abilities.  But we are getting there. ^__^<br />
<br />
Heh.  Wish me luck!<br />

Personally, I regard &quot;psi&quot; in the same I regard &quot;wind.&quot;   There is no &quot;wind&quot; as a thing.  It is moving air.  We measure wind by how it affects another instrument or object.  We can measure the speed, the pressure and the density of air and that gives us indicators to how waves on the ocean nad the patterns of weather and such behave.

From my research, I have reasons to believe that &quot;psi&quot; is simply the observed effect of another more fundamental system of energy making changes to the physical.  I feel it&#039;s safe to say that &quot;psi&quot; is not a special energy all its own but as air in motion becomes wind, this energy put to action becomes what we call &quot;psi.&quot;

Without going in to too much detail, research indicates that the energy at work here is potential energy stored in the environment (universe).  Pressure on this energy (scalars) creates stress energy (potential) that can be programmed with information (thought) to do work.

I have secretly been working on a unit of measure for &quot;psi.&quot;  It&#039;s okay enough for my work but it definitely needs a lot more refinement to be useful to others.  It&#039;s a unit of measure for &quot;psi influence&quot; on a measured quantity of material.

The point of reference is a sphere of platinum-iridium alloy suspended by a wire from an axis two feet from a table surface.

The material is very pure and consistent.  If indeed my theories are true that PK is a passive effect that interacts with an object&#039;s material rather than an active force that &quot;pushes&quot; an object, the sphere will require a consistent amount of &quot;influence&quot; to move it a specific distance.  A laser measures the degree of movement and that corresponds so the amount of &quot;influence&quot; &quot;psi&quot; has over the object.  Thus far tests have been positive.

In my mind, &quot;psi&quot; as a “stuff” is only present with energy manipulation and psychokinesis.  Telepathy, empathy and other thought-based skills work purely on an information level and are not related to &quot;psi&quot; as a substance; basically the distinction of Psi-Kappa and Psi-Gamma.

&quot;Psi&quot; as a classification encompasses it all, but it not measurable as such.  It&#039;s just a classification.

My method for measurement seems to be consistent enough for PK measurement.  It has an unchanging reference point and seems to be repeatable between testers.  I have a tentative designation of &quot;PKI&quot; for &quot;unit of psychokinetic influence.&quot;  I used platinum-iridium alloy because it is directly related to the determination of the International Prototype Kilogram.  Though material densities differ, with marginal accuracy I can weigh an object in kilograms, measure its dimensions, estimate its volume and know how many &quot;PKI&#039;s of influence&quot; are needed to move it before resistance.  

The interesting component here is that a &quot;field of influence&quot; comes in to affect.  Roughly calculated it takes 1pki of influence to get 180g of platinum-iridium to travel 1cm in one second; but only if you envelop the entire object with influence.  If you are &quot;tugging&quot; on only a small portion of the object you will need much more influence to move it.  The same goes the other way.  If the object weighs the same but is larger in volume (is less dense) it will take far less total influence to move provided you can distribute the influence across the entire object.

It&#039;s very neat stuff.

I&#039;m working with some colleagues to fix some of the broken math and hopefully have a usable standard by year&#039;s end.

Now this is all well and good for PK but what about energy manipulation?  Well, at the moment, we can only measure what is interacting with physicality.  Once energy interacts with the physical it has become psychokinesis.

I’m working on a way to measure how energy in energy manipulation behaves by creating physical fields that are modulated by the energy passing through them or around them but for obvious reasons that is much more difficult.

My goal with PKI is to give us a physically grounded way to measure PK influence in a reliable way.  I think it achieves that.  The next (big) step is to see how energy manipulation like constructs, shields and such can be “measured” using understood and reliable reference points.  But we have to leave the physical to examine that.

While PKI gives us a reference of physical effect, it still doesn’t give us insight into the energy used to fuel PK as well as other skills and abilities.  But we are getting there. ^__^

Heh.  Wish me luck!

Would it be safe to say that Pk has a field similar to that of a magnet, in the sense that you are aligning psi (if psi is indeed something similar to energy) in a field created by thought in any particular location which then causes the objects atoms to align itself to the source of the field (and therefore move?)<br />
<br />
Which is to say that Pk in itself doesn&#039;t require work, but the actual creation of the field does?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really not sure, but am I touching on the basic Idea you have here? Either way I think this has Merit. The only hard part is figuring out how to get that original alignment of energy, and proving that the effects you have recorded are acctually caused by other effects. Which I&#039;m assuming you are trying to do by using a larger object not affected by many other forces.<br />

You pretty much get it though alignment of the atoms may not be the cause of the motion.  If you put a boat in a flowing river it will be pulled or pushed in the direction the water is flowing.  Think of this like you are catching material in a flowing stream of energy and you control where the energy flows. You could liken this to magnetic fields in the way that the field of influence permeates the object and pulls or pushes it around.  The difference here is that this field works with all materials regardless of their magnetic susceptibility.  Tests have shown that PK influence on a magnet gave no perceivable benefit or detriment to an ingot of metal of the same dimensions and density.<br />
<br />
One stem of this project is looking at diamagnetism as a possible means of control.  All materials exhibit diamagnetism so it could be that we are interacting with objects on that level.  The theory of Nucleonic Energy also poses some possible avenues of control.<br />

Levitating non-magnetic objects has been achieved with specially-created electromagnetic fields leveraging diamagnetism to an extreme.  This was done at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.<br />
