		<div id="post_16567" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi guys I had these questions about OBE for a while in my head now and I still believe that they will not be fully answered, cos well no one knows for sure ^^. I am asking to get your personal opinions (facts if you have any) and to get some sort of conclusion about the whole OBE thing.<br />
<br />
First one would be:<br />
what happens to you and actually, (if you wish, be specific) where does one go during the OBE. Is it some sort of veil, (a parallel universe perhaps?) another dimension? I know and have read, Sean wrote, that the whole OBE is little understood and there is not much knowledge about it yet still, he also wrote that it is we who are the first explorers ^^ and it up to us so, it would be quite cool to not be alone with my own opinion and to hear yours too, to hear with what conclusions you have came up with.<br />
<br />
Second would be, a reassuring:<br />
I&#039;m not sure if I had one at all (OBE), tough I think I did, it was three to four dreams in one month. It was like a dream where you gain control, if that helps, but to the extend, I realised that I was dreaming, yet I still was laying down in my bed with my eyes closed and I could not move, nor see  anything, it was like the body was not listening like it was disconnected, does it relate to OBE or is it something entirely different?<br />
<br />
The third is more of a curiosity:<br />
I remember Sean wrote, that during his first or second “expedition” noticed two things: (likely more   I think I have forgot the rest ^^) there are some arbitrary stuff laying in his room and that all 4 senses were inactive (except vision I can be wrong). So if you had any OBE&#039;s what kind of stuff do you see laying around? Also if you encountered the same one as he did (he stated that he found a note of some kind he picked up to read and suddenly it turned into a peace of wood) if you did happen to find a note and without touching it can you tell me if it means something or is it complete mess/gibberish?<br />
<br />
The forth would be:<br />
from the book about OBE forgot the author, I think it was chapter 11 (it was advertised by the PsiPog as a good source of OBE intel) it was his accident or incident with the author and the “vampire lady”. Now there are two questions out of that, he wrote that after a few times of using OBE, he said that he had some sort of “involuntary entrance in to the OBE state”, actually in the chapter he said/wrote that he entered that one while walking the road (the question is - does that happen? Or is that very rare next to impossible?) latter after some scouting he encountered some sort of woman, she jumped on him and then started to suck his (left?) arm, thus the vampire lady, few seconds from that he experienced some sort of shock which “dispelled” the OBE session (possibly the adrenalin or the instincts self preservation security measures kicked in) when he looked at the arm (back in the real world) he saw that, at the area of effect, the arm was blood red and it felt like somebody hit with a sledge hammer (the second question would be is it possible to be attacked in OBE? And have you had any encounters with beings in the OBE?)<br />
<br />
And I believe the last would be:<br />
since I have had no luck (at least I think so) what is it like to actually experience an OBE, I remember Sean wrote that there was a time he did not saw the different entirely, I think he wrote that he walked down the stairs and then he saw his parents arguing, he tried to &#039;&#039;join the chat&#039;&#039; but with no luck and after he realised that they do not see him he realised that he was OBE. And then there was another my friend said that he once attempted it yet he said when he entered it was so overwhelming and scary that he immediately turned his tail and never returned, so I guess my question would be – what is it like and does it stay the same all the time or at first it may look very odd, maybe different colours (takes times to adapt) or is it persistent and is very difficult to notice the difference for the real world?<br />
If you have answer or some additional toughs only to some of them, do not be shy just tell what you think about those that you know ^^</div>

<br />
1<br />
In an OBE, your consciousness is somehow projected away from your body. Some authors note that in the most &quot;low level&quot; form of OBE your surroundings are the same as the physical world. There are dimensions other than time, x, y and z axis, a good amount of physics depends and would not function without this. Try looking up a &quot;hypercube&quot; (geometry, not cinema) so you&#039;ll get a feel for this. It is then understandable, that if your consciousness is not tethered to normal spacetime, you might be able to move in &quot;new directions&quot;, but this could be false... in any case, you are where you are, trying to explain it would only make it more complicated. <br />
<br />
2<br />
Look up &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;,<br />
<br />
3<br />
If a blind person projects they can still sense what&#039;s around them. According to &quot;Astral Dynamics&quot; (book) the author was actually MORE sensitive than usual. Only being able to see is probably a side effect of us more and more putting the other senses on the sidelines, food will usually taste and smell good and we are usually sure enough it isn&#039;t spoiled so we don&#039;t pay as much attention to it as we should.<br />
<br />
4<br />
From what I&#039;ve seen (saw this happen to someone) it&#039;s usually the case that the person is already very sensitive and/or project without much effort. This is usually not the case with most people, so I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Being stung by a wasp is much more likely and from what you wrote would have similar effects.<br />
<br />
5<br />
was it night time when your friend tried it? Night time can already be pretty scary, especially if you experience something like &quot;projecting out of your friggin body&quot; for the first time.<br />
<br />
aaand that should be it, 2 months and a week after you psted the question :P<br />
<br />
Note that I don&#039;t actually project, but I can point you to the sources of my info if needed. (though a good part is just logic)</div>
