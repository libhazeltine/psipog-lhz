Sometimes, if I concentrate, I can get to this state, but I&#039;ve only been able to do it twice (plus, it was right after it had happened by accident)<br />

that&#039;s... an interesting question. i&#039;ll have to think about that.<br />

though, while a little of topic, i have seen blind people walking around by themself in a big room which was supported by pillars. there were times i was sure someone was about to walk into them, but the always walked around instead. i don&#039;t think they even realized they did it. it was kinda cool IMO.</div>I&#039;ve heard about that too and I know why: Probabily that room is from theirs house, they remember how theirs home is.

Isn&#039;t still really amazing, isn&#039;t it still something worth persuing. I wonder sometimes about the elaborate ways my mind could be tricking me, or mistaking one really unlikely thing for one unlikely thing, and I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that regardless of what these things are they still demonstrate the awesome power of the mind, even if what we are descovering isn&#039;t what we originally think it is, it&#039;s still something worth discovering, it&#039;s still pioneering. <br />
<br />
So if i&#039;m not seeing through my eyes but i&#039;m only remembering what went where and by changing certain pieces of information like moving a limb predicting or guessing how my environment would react, that&#039;s a pretty great skill that could be applied in life or science or WHATEVER; you see where i&#039;m going with this.</div>

I recommend that you bring yourself to, maybe the theta state, of brainwave activity through your method of choice, and then half consciously nudge yourself to the state of mind.<br />

I see aura&#039;s well, but seeing with the minds eye is a bit more difficult for me. Best of luck ^_-</div>
