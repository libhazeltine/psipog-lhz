<br />
Os, I&#039;ve only met one other person on this site in person, and he&#039;s just...weird...but I understand him. And I know myself (to an extent.)<br />
<br />
But, what kind of people are you guys? I mean, what kind of jobs do you have, school, family life, hobbies, ect. Things like that.<br />
<br />
(I know this does get into kind of personal stuff, but it&#039;s your decision.)<br />
<br />
Me? I was born in a bedroom in the pouch two hours away from the Canadian border n Washington. I have four siblings, and not harsh family life. I was homeschooled up to fifth grade and went to public school from fifth to freshman year. I have been in online school for two years now and I am a junior. <br />
<br />
I plan on going to a local college for two years, then going to Hillsdale college. I want to become a writer and write stories. I want a family and am looking forward to getting married as soon as I&#039;m able.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like people touching me, I don&#039;t understand emotions, I enjoy my computer and video games (strategy/fantasy) and the outdoors. Love running and reading, but don&#039;t do them often. I am prone to do things for people, I&#039;m shy so I have my own makeshift shield to keep people out. I&#039;m not strong, but I enjoy messing with peoples heads because in my opinion thats their weakness.<br />
<br />
And.....I can create monsters out of people to be afraid of.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so what are you guys like?<br />
<br />

		<div id="post_16399" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I posted a thread in the Recycle Bin a while ago, asking if and then why most of the psions are programmers.<br />
<br />
Well, I&#039;m a programmer since .. I don&#039;t know, wrote something when I was 6 or 7. Then A few years later I started programming again. =P But that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m good at programming - I&#039;ve never finished even one project.<br />
<br />
But before programming, one of my hobbies was reading encyclopedias - there were all kinds of mystical pictures, schematics and stuff. The pyramids, temples, Egyptian and Olmec languages seemed pretty interesting - that&#039;s actually what I thought I would be taught in the grammar school (wrong, obviously - school was boring with the exception of the last 3 years). Then there were a few books on my father&#039;s bookshelf that seemed interesting - one was some kind of magic book or something and the other was on linear devices. Both were in Russian so I couldn&#039;t read any of them.<br />
<br />
In the first 4-5 years of Elementary School, I was a &#039;monster&#039; out of control and barely had any friends. Then I closed down into my own box without noticing anyone / anything around me for a few years. Then in 8th - 9th grade I slowly opened the box again and changed radically. Now I&#039;m obsessed with trying to gain control over myself in as many aspects as possible.<br />
<br />
High-school was interesting, because I turned active - started visiting olympiads, building robots and tinkering electronics with one of my friends. We also practiced psionics together for a few weeks. Started some multi-member programming projects with my friends and so on..<br />
<br />
My interests range from programming, electronics to music production (as well as playing some instruments), acting and archaeology. That&#039;s a really wide range and a lot of those I haven&#039;t even tried yet. I have been driven by curiosity against all things that seem complex and mysterious. So, I went to study physics (seemed general enough) in our local university.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t play one video / computer game for more than a week (I either finish it or drop it then and enjoy an urge to program something myself).<br />
<br />
During the summer I&#039;m away from the city, usually helping out my aunts, uncles and grandparents on an island. Oh, and I just love chopping firewood - it&#039;s another form of meditation with immediate response on the ability to focus.<br />
<br />
My father is an alien abductee and there are rumors that from his line, there have been a few healers. My mother is interested in healing and has finished quite a few courses. I also have a younger sister.<br />
<br />
XD I feel like I have babbled for too long already..</div>

As for me, I&#039;ve always just been able to understand people. By the age of 4 or 5 I could get a sense of what people were feeling, and it&#039;s gotten stronger and stronger. I&#039;ve always been a natural empath, and I&#039;ve enjoyed learning psionic empathy.<br />
<br />
When I was around 5 I taught myself to read, and by the age of six I had read The Lord of the Rings and the entire Narnia series. I&#039;ve always enjoyed reading, and I remember most of what I read, and I have an almost word for word memory, if the subject is interesting to me. :p<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always had an abundance of casual friends, mostly &#039;school friends&#039;, and a few close ones, all through Elementary to High School. I&#039;m currently a junior, by the way.</div>

		<div id="post_16406" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Its always interesting to hear the story of people, hwo they were and are now ^^. So I guess its my turn.<br />
<br />
I live in Austria, was also born there and haven&#039;t got much out of it. I went only once to Egypt and once to Malta. I&#039;m a Software Engineer, for those who don&#039;t know what that is, I&#039;m a programmer.<br />
<br />
I was born and started growing up being a lovly child which was always laughing until I got 2. My mother always tells me from one day to the next one my mood changed radically from always happy too always moody. My attitude stayed until the end of 2007 (so that were about 19 years of bad mood, imagine that). That was when my time at the military ended (had to do half a year. Stupid civic duty). I don&#039;t know what exactly changed me. Maybe the time at the military made me think, &quot;that is not the world I want to be in (military that is), time to change my life into something less aggressive&quot;. I guess it was sth like that. So I did something which I already wanted to do sooner, but always had forgot about it: Searching the internet about Telekinesis (If you think you misread, read again).<br />
<br />
So my time as a &quot;psion&quot; began, or better said, was beginning to become one. The first forum I found was some hypnosis forum which brought me to autohypnosis, which I did until getting a job. Soon after i found psipog and started to get a bit deeper into the matter, started with EM and tried a little TK. Unfortunately the training stopped as i got a job, because I didn&#039;t have the time for it, or I just didn&#039;t wnat to spend the little free time I had left on training. In Summer 2008 I started with lucid dreaming training, but I didn&#039;t really get much results, so I stopped beginning 2009.<br />
<br />
2009 was a great year. At the beginning I started to try a healing technique, which I developed when I was about 10-12 on other people. i started with my parents and got some pretty good results, although rarely lasting ones. Then in May someone on here posting sth about Quantum Touch, a really powerful healing technique, which I practice til now and have finished my second workshop just today, 2 hours ago and its starting to get better and better ;)<br />
<br />
One really interesting thing is, I have a cousin who is some years older than me. Everyone says I look just like him, although I can&#039;t see why. But the thing is we both were &quot;problem children&quot; and we both got on the spiritual &quot;train&quot; somehow, which is really interesting in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Soooo,..... do I get the &quot;longest post&quot;-Achievement? ^^</div>

<br />
My life is pretty boring, was born and currently live in a small town in Texas (not one of those tiny ones with a bunch of horses, people =P). I learned to read at a really young age and was an oddball, (still sort of am, I just know how to tone it down now). I&#039;m smart but not really in a school kind of way, if I&#039;m interested in something I&#039;ll look it up and read everything I can about it. The problem is I love to do things and experience them, but I really don&#039;t have any follow-through. I start projects and hardly ever finish them, and if I do finish I don&#039;t usually do it again. (So I like learning about psionics, I get excited once in a while, learn everything I can, and never keep trying =P)<br />
<br />
Um. Later on in life I fell into some stuff which gives me an interesting perspective on things, and I&#039;m still trying to sort it all out. I don&#039;t know what I want to do with my life, I don&#039;t have any aspirations, I just want to live if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like being touched by people who I&#039;m not close to, I&#039;m extremely cynical, I don&#039;t like most people. I&#039;m pretty intuitive, and I get this feeling when I&#039;m going to click with someone, which is how for the most part I pick my friends. I&#039;m analytical and hate emotions, even though I need them...<br />
<br />
Had a job, quit it. Need to find another. :/ Oh. I like videogames and love music, and I don&#039;t really like TV but there are a few series that I watch.<br />
<br />
One of the things I&#039;ve stuck with is painting, and also photography. And I love psychology and sociology.<br />
<br />
Yeah. I think that&#039;s about it. Hah.</div>

<br />
i live in a rural town in oklahoma.....a forth of the population is dogs and cats. i&#039;ve been a programmer for almost 5 years and a web designer off and on for 7. i&#039;ve been homeschooled my whole life and i&#039;m attending a tech school for my second year in a class that has a name that tells what we do also....NSA or Network Security and Administration. I&#039;m currently a senior and am talking evening classes at my tech center from a community college. I&#039;ve always been smart which makes my friends mad at me sometimes.....but great at finding ways to be sweet to my soon to be girlfriend.<br />
<br />
there&#039;s really not much to say....<br />
<br />
as for psionics....<br />
<br />
i&#039;ve programmed sub c. mind that if i do certain hand signs in sequence to send psi to my hands until i stop it.......it&#039;s nice until your the muscles in your hands start locking up......... i came up with this after reading naruto....yes naruto....i thought hey they do signs and it allows them to control their chakra so why can&#039;t i do that with psi? it actually wasn&#039;t hard to program but i don&#039;t remember how i did it now.........oh well. at least i can make my psiballs faster and without concentrating or meditation.....and i can even use that for quick sensing of objects like i picked up on a guy at my tech center that has some ability......still haven&#039;t found him though.....<br />
<br />
i&#039;ve never been good at construct programming but i have made constructs. i made one that i told to gather its own energy but i forgot to tell it to not take it from any living creature or plants so i felt a pain in my arm almost vampire like.....atleast i programmed a killswitch..... i can make a psiball that will last a while and where friends can tell its there after i make &#039;em. the cool thing is they feel the heat but as soon as i shift the focus on it it&#039;s like it flips over with a cold side. first they feel cold (almost as cold as ice) and think it&#039;t from the room and i feel the heat then i shift focus and i feel the cold and they suddenly feel the heat freaking them out!!! it&#039;s kinda fun........ anyway i have had to learn psionics as i wasn&#039;t born with anything though i&#039;ve slowly developed empathy  and not know it until recently when i would feel the underlying emotions of friends who didn&#039;t know what was wrong with themselves and it would change if i talked to someone else. an example was i was talking to my soon to be girlfriend and would be happy and feel her happiness then i would open my im and before even typing a message to a friend i would instantly feel her depression which made me sad.<br />

Erm...I can only play a game or something for the first sitting, &#039;cause I get an overwhelming urge every time to create something like it myself...that&#039;s unless it&#039;s a visual novel. Then again, I&#039;ve never really finished any of the projects I had started.<br />

My forte, if I can call it that, is, however, Daydreaming--I can go on (and usually do) for hours on end.<br />
