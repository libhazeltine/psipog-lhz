You can get into things like Chinese medicine and look at their nutrition (finding a balance between hot, warm, cool and cold foods to keep meridians balanced) but its hardly a system accepted by western thought.

It&#039;s basic that Vitamin C and Potassium will raise natural acidity levels which can result in a higher natural capacitance of energy. The more energy you have, the better you are for Psi. So I would recommend a fairly balanced diet with more citrus and potassium rich foods, coupled with daily exercise to raise your ability.<br />

As for what trick said, I think you should study more about chakra&#039;s in general before you blatantly decide they don&#039;t exist. <br />
<br />
Chakras are basically the natural energy flow of the human body, It has links to modern Science (in small amounts) even today. The Idea may have matured, but it should never be forgotten.<br />
<br />
More over, if you are more in line with the system shone at the Psions Guild. I may be able to help you there as well. You see, It seems that the Fields and tones have the same general field that the chakra system does without all of the points. I have reason to believe that both are correct, simply because of this. If that is the case, I think that the chakra system is the inner body system (the hard-wired flow of energy) and the Tones are what is seen at a surface level.<br />
<br />
Granted, more advanced psions may be able to hit pinpoint locations within the tone field in order to affect the whole person in specific ways. The tone system is acctually nice because it gives a broader field of view compared to the chakra system. but the chakra system is more advanced and can be used once the affected field has been found. <br />
<br />
A small note on the highest and lowest Chakra. It is never said that the Highest chakra links one to God, It did say something on a higher consciousness though. Therefore It can be assumed that this higher chakra is essentially part of the collective subconscious. The Lowest Chakra is supposed to be the root, it connects you with the earth and all life in general. This can be seen as the point in which we draw through in meditation.<br />
<br />
Me and Winged Wolf have are disagreements. She&#039;s honestly to adamant in what she sees as correct, and those who are not open to fail will never succeed.<br />

First of all you have to prove an energy system exists. Second, you have to prove that Chakra&#039;s do what you claim such as what you stated about the highest and lowest chakras. You expect someone to believe that, not only does there exist a collective unconscious but that we can connect to it and that we can somehow &quot;connect&quot; with the earth? How can we connect with the earth? Through what means does is one considered &quot;connected&quot;? Can it be tested? There are way, too many things to prove for chakras to exist in any form. Especially since you have to posit that there is some energy force that people can use. Show me some research before you make some illogical claims such as this.</div>

<br />
Nothing is impossible until disproved, only improbable...<br />
<br />
The energy system is taking a new look at the systems of our body which naturally produce energy. <br />
<br />
The Highest and Lowest Chakras are just part of the way that it is discribed by all the information I&#039;ve found on chakras online.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.rickrichards.com/chakras/Chakras1a.html" target="_blank">http://www.rickrichards.com/chakras/Chakras1a.html</a><br />
<br />
The website above can explain in further detail about how I came about alot of my information, or at the very least alot of my information I researched can e found here. They speak of how the organs emit the energy in itself. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I am also speaking of It&#039;s links to the Psion Guild&#039;s chart posted on their website. Here it localizes different abilities and waves to centers of the body. If you were to examine the two systems,  the Chakra system and their system, you&#039;d find many similarities between location. The only problem that you&#039;ll face when doing this is finding a complete illustration that is well explained and diagrammed (a problem I&#039;m still facing).<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not that I have to prove that there is an energy force, we have that, the real problem is how the human body would acctually use it. It can be measured, also, however; It would take more money than I have to afford such equipment.<br />
<br />
There are many theories on what the energy is (some say psi, some say &quot;it&#039;s just energy, simple as that, whereas I personally think it may have to do with naturally occurring electromagnetism inside the earth, i.e. energy in motion or the earths magnetic field), The fact of the matter is that there is nothing to say we can&#039;t.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really making any more of an illogical claim than anyone else. I&#039;m just making it about something slightly different. If you can make a psi ball, there must be a reason you can make a psi-ball. I have found that this is caused by muscles within the skin that expand the veins and cause radiation of energy as heat from our body. The Idea that we can control this energy freely when we program things and we make cold psi-balls. Because it means that isn&#039;t just radiating out of our bodies. It can also pull in energy radiated and change the pattern of the energy itself.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also fairly good to note that nothing is absolute in life, nothing. Knowledge is just a myth that we know and understand something. Granted, we can put things we think we know to good use, but we can never prove them if the system at it&#039;s root is uncertain to us. To say that you know the system root is just diluting yourself, because there is a lot about life we are uncertain about.<br />
<br />
By Mathematical calculations scientist today estimate that Atoms, normal matter, makes up 4% of our universe, and we don&#039;t even understand half of that yet.<br />
<br />
Now, before you say my claims are illogical, do a little research,and come back with some hard evidence to Disprove what I&#039;m saying. Instead of blatantly saying it is impossible, prove it is impossible, then get back to me.  <br />

I really didn&#039;t mean to criticize what you&#039;re saying. I just meant to say that it seems that you are deciding based on your interpretation of what they&#039;re saying, rather than what they&#039;re saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stimulation of the Heart Chakra makes the person instinctively aware of the joys and sorrows of others. You essentially feel the feelings of others. This psychic ability has an adverse downside - you may be easily effected by another person&#039;s emotional feelings, thus altering your own without knowing it.&quot; - from the link shown above<br />
<br />
Love in a spiritual sense is the melding of opposites. Basically what it means is that the heart chakra is, in essence, the epicenter of empathy. It also means that you not only send out your &quot;Love&quot; out through this point, but take in others. Sean believes that emotions are essentially created from the heart (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong Sean, I don&#039;t want to misrepresent you), and that he doesn&#039;t completely buy that emotions are entirely created by chemicals in the brain. I don&#039;t entirely agree with this, mind you, but I believe what he&#039;s saying does have merit and emotions are definitely felt from the heart and not the head.<br />
<br />
As for proof, it&#039;s all around you... I can&#039;t really help you find it, but I can help to clarify some of the things that they are talking about. Without all of the BS that they give to the inexperienced. I will give you the information in as much detail as I possibly can, but I will try to keep it simple enough for the average person to understand.<br />

Final notes:<br />
Keep in mind that translation is fairly difficult between western and eastern civilizations. There&#039;s a huge gap n the structure. To be put simply there are differences in syntax between the languages.<br />

To give you a Idea of what I mean. To most of us here, Chinese kanji looks like unreadable pictures. Where as, to those who only know Chinese, English words would look like unreadable pictures.<br />

You seem to misunderstand scientific method. Its very hard to disprove something (ie prove that its not there), trick is correct is suggesting that an entirely energetic system is not proven (to the extent to warrant scientific appraisal of the theory and studying of the idea by the mainstream) to exist in the body and the burden of proof lies with the believers rather than scientists.<br />

If your being hypothetical again its not coming off as such which makes the willingness to point out the illusion of knowledge funny since you sound as though you speak with knowing.<br />

Honest mistake, though a little hypocritical, to suggest someone else has misinterpreted a third person&#039;s writing. You can &#039;clarify&#039; in so much as they are willing to listen to your thoughts on the text, but it is in no way any more correct or wrong than the points they reached. There is no true interpretation because everyone brings their own background and philosophy to adapt to it. Even the author is of questionable reliability because any attempt to clarify is just a new bundle of words to be misinterpreted.<br />
<br />
To postulate that you know the correct message is fine, probably not true, but fine. However, to suggest to others to listen to you as a source of the correct, well I think Socrates would smack ya. How do you know whats right; even if the author agrees with you he will be making difference inferences about your perspective from your language and statements; isn&#039;t it possible your just generating another text that has been heard to only seem correct?<br />

No, what I&#039;ve really been saying is that there is evidence that there is connection, and that this needs to be examined before you should say that it does not exist.

I see it dripping off of every word, every sentence, seething like a vile wretch upon the pureness of the the Idea that lies within.

As in the words of the serpent, who from one point of view taunted Eve to eat the Forbidden Fruit, and from another tried to bring her to truth. One could say that the Serpent only wished for Eve to Aspire for knowledge and wisdom (represented as the tree the serpent himself was apon), and she was then tempted for fame which could be found from this knowledge (represented as the fruit). The Fame that came from this new found knowledge caused Eve and all who have tasted fame to damnation. Viewed in this sense, the Serpent is represented as the teacher of this knowledge, and because eve had realized fame, The Serpent was crippled. Crippled in many, many ways.

I can only say that I am sorry, it is wrong of me to preach anything to you.

Again to reference Chinese Medicine, Pizza would be a Hot food which for the most part the Western Diet is considered already leaning that way. So it would be less than helpful in balancing the energetic system of the body.<br />
<br />
When it comes to supreme your talking about bacon, and there are actually a few societies with a biased against eating pork. Participating in shamanic ceremonies in Peru I was advised not to consume pork till a month had passed after the final ceremony(shorter restrictions on sugar, sweet things, alcohol and having sex). I&#039;m not particular drawn to pork in any form so it wasn&#039;t hard to avoid but I imagine I could have eaten it just fine. They described that its energy was heavy and wouldn&#039;t move through your system as easily as other plants and animals. Sort of a, if you could sense it, you probably wouldn&#039;t like the feeling either, so we suggest not having any.<br />
<br />
Then there is just basic nutrition that suggests a good amount of meat to eat each week is around half a pound, I think your pizza would fulfill that in a sitting.</div>

		<div id="post_11192" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Come to think of it, Pork does have that feeling to me. My body becomes more lethargic after eating pork.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have come to believe that many of the times people talk of energy. They usually mean that it causes certain physical reactions. i.e. If you eat pork, you become more lethargic after eating, therefore pork has a heavy energy which is hard to move through the body.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s because of this that I have began to see merit in the chakra system, actually. I won&#039;t go into details here, but it&#039;s an interesting thing to think about.<br />
<br />
I also would have to say that basic nutrition has merit, but the way it&#039;s set up (atleast where I&#039;m at) they&#039;re using it as a scare tactic to control what we do in a day.<br />
<br />
On the standard diet they recommend that you follow their strict standard and telling us that it&#039;s to keep you healthy.<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that not only does a strict standard cut away at our individuality, It treats humanity as a crop.<br />
<br />
Certain foods have certain effects on the body, this is because of the chemical makeup of the food itself. The way basic nutrition would have it, they would want us to all have the same effects come upon our body and mind. Now, this is where I start to think of the negative implications a controlled food supply can have on the general population. <br />
<br />
As an example, you could look at corn. Corn is just the product of controlling the crop. At this point it could not survive without human cultivation.<br />
<br />
This means that, in theory, if you are controlled by a higher power. How you breed, how you eat, and what you do. You will become no more than a slave to that higher power. <br />
<br />
Basically, what I&#039;m saying is that you can stay in a balanced diet no matter how active you are because food and exercise are variables. It&#039;s all up to you for what you want to do, just make sure you do the research before you get sucked into the population.<br />

I think that eventually a diet could be tailored to a person but yeah it would be an individual thing, rather than one for all.<br />

You can make the argument of human cultivation for a number of things both plant and animals. Cows would probably die off pretty quickly without human intervention (not that we take good care of them) though its possible they might surprise us. I could see the argument for avoiding modified fruits and vegetables except that were we to bother trying to feed the entire human population there wouldn&#039;t be enough land to grow it on. So in that respect spliced foods are probably here to stay.<br />
<br />
On the whole higher power thing I&#039;d lean towards taking it into a more determinism/fatalism debate but not really appropriate. So I guess I will agree that diets and food are marketed and always of questionable health value to a person; though I don&#039;t necessarily accept the conclusion that it leads to or is related to controlling the masses (other than getting them to buy things).</div>
