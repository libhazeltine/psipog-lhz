		<div id="post_12027" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hello, everyone. I&#039;m not really... new, to this site. I&#039;ve had an account for a while, I&#039;ve just never gotten around to using it. But I figured, hey, why not? The people here seem nice enough. Sorry if this post is really long, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve read about psychic abilities for a while, around three or four years. Some of them I have tried, some of them I have not. Some of them actually seem impossible to me. I&#039;ve practiced some of the big things, like creating Psi balls, psychokinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, etc. I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve had very much progress with those at all, heh heh. While I have no real skill in any of those, I mostly enjoy coming up with theories on how they may be possible and how to test them. <br />
<br />
One ability, though, I have had great results in. And, really, I don&#039;t even call it a &quot;psychic ability&quot;. Communicating with my subconscious is what I do best out of all the weird things I&#039;ve practiced, and it&#039;s what I&#039;ve enjoyed the most as well.<br />
<br />
When I first began, I did those basic little exercises. Imagining a pool of water, and the ripples being subconscious messages. That type of thing. Sadly, just like my previous experiments with skills such as these, I failed. I couldn&#039;t get anything. I had given up for quite a while.<br />
<br />
One day, I decide to try again. But I though that since I was getting no where with these methods, I&#039;d try something of my own creation. This method of mine seemed a bit advanced, but I tried it anyway. I thought up a look for a person. After completing the look for this person, I created a little peaceful tranquil home for him. <br />
<br />
Afterward, I got used to how this place looked, along with the man inside it. I got it memorized so that anytime I wanted to, I could imagine it, just like that. Before long, I decided it was time to work out my method. I tried to use this humanoid figure as a link to my subconscious. I would ask it questions and attempt to get responses. <br />
<br />
At first, this was a bit difficult. I couldn&#039;t keep focused to long, and I was mostly limited to asking yes or no questions, getting nods or head shakes. But, what kept me going was that most of the answers I got seemed to be true. I was a bit discouraged, thinking it was only my imagination, but I decided I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. I kept practicing.<br />
<br />
After a few months, I could focus for a long time. Around thirty minutes! That was great for me. But I was still limited to simple yes or no questions. But then, I thought of something. This humanoid image was able to nod and give head shakes, because it had a head to nod. However, it never talked. I did some thinking, and created a voice for it.<br />
<br />
To this day, I&#039;m not sure why or how, but the voice ended up being a female&#039;s. So, I changed the humanoid&#039;s body to that of a female to match it.<br />
<br />
I was extremely happy! I had successfully created a link to my subconscious in a way that I could easily relate to as a human! I was able to ask it more complex questions and get vocal answers from this little image in my head! However, it required a bit more focus, which I needed more practice on. And, sometimes my focus would lack, and I would just get back to movements. Ah well.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I could keep up this person all the time, anytime I desired. It was a little bit of practice every night before going to sleep well worth it! I was a bit doubtful at first, thinking the entire thing was just my imagination. But when damn near everything I ask it is true, I start to believe I&#039;ve succeeded in completing the link.<br />
<br />
Now, about only a month ago, I started getting more involved with my subconscious. I asked it to give me advice throughout the day, without needing to focus and ask a question. This worked quite well. Every now and then, I might just hear that little voice I invented tell me something, usually something of good nature. It seems to really like me to help people out all the time, but whenever I do those random acts of kindness it suggests I do, good things always end up happening. <br />
<br />
Finally, about two weeks ago, I went on a trip and fell behind in school. I needed help to get caught up. Bad. So, I decided to ask my subconscious for help. Oddly enough, it really couldn&#039;t help me too much when it came to catching up on my schoolwork. Well, I decided on something else that would help me, and help me study a bit more about my subconscious. I went through the first process and created a second link to my subconscious. I made a new person, a new voice, and it didn&#039;t take even a day for me to be used to this person. I was already trained on that. I tried a new thing to experiment. I gave this new person a different personality. I made them intelligent, pretty booksmart-like, and a bit rude. This second link I used to help get a lot of schoolwork done. I got about five days of schoolwork caught up in about a day and a half. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve had a great success with my subconscious, and, I&#039;m thinking, with it&#039;s help, I can move on to other psychic abilities and try to research them better. All it took was a few minutes before going to sleep every night to practice this, so why wouldn&#039;t it be the same with other skills?<br />
========================================================<br />
So, the point of this is to discuss communicating with your subconscious. How you do it, if you do it, if it works for you, benefits from it, etc. etc. <br />
<br />
Before anyone calls me crazy or anything, these links I&#039;ve created aren&#039;t any way insane. They don&#039;t try to manipulate me or tell me to &quot;burn things&quot; or to hurt anyone in any way, shape, or form.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is really long!<br />

thanks again!</div>When helping me with all of my late schoolwork, it did a few things. It helped me rework my schedule so that I would have more time to get it done. It also helped me out a lot in math work, as if it were a form of tutor.

Hey, thanks for sharing.
But in what ways did this &quot;new&quot; aspect of your subconscious help you? Did he/she/it just say motivational things to you while you were studying... or?

and you said whenever you do nice things, your subconscious makes good things happen to you. can you elaborate on this further? what kind of good things? and how can you be sure that it&#039;s cause and effect? 
thanks again![/quote]

When helping me with all of my late schoolwork, it did a few things. It helped me rework my schedule so that I would have more time to get it done. It also helped me out a lot in math work, as if it were a form of tutor. It would help me with some problems that I just couldn&#039;t do, by guiding me through the process(I&#039;m terrible at mathematics of all kinds!).

		<div id="post_12049" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Your idea for communicating with your subconscious is very creative, and sounds like it could work pretty well. Of course, as with all such things, it varies from person to person, but that&#039;s neither here nor there. It&#039;s at least worth a shot for those who are just starting out.<br />
<br />
Psiballs aren&#039;t really advanced or a big thing. It does take a little time to learn them, but compared to say, psychokinesis (taking an entire year to learn the psi-wheel is not unheard of), it&#039;s cake.<br />
<br />
As for me, I just treat my subconscious like what it is: a part of my mind that I can&#039;t control, and part of who I am. Sometimes it chimes in, sometimes it stays silent, and sometimes I ignore it accidentally.<br />
<br />
Every story I&#039;ve read about people communicating with their subconscious, it seems like it likes them to do kind things for people. Even someone as spiteful as myself (I pretended to like a girl at work to upset her guy friends) hears &quot;No, put that change in the charity jar, they need it more than you.&quot; from time to time. Maybe it&#039;s part of human nature to want to be kind?</div>

Has anyone tried to practice and exactly after that going to bed?</div>Done that for years (hm, about 4 now), and it works like a charm. Nowdays I&#039;m practicing little bit different things, but still I do those right before going to sleep OR 2-3 hours before bedtime. Best way is what &quot;feels&quot; best for you, try both of those I mentioned, and choose the one suits you best. 2-3 hours needs something that I call &quot;total forgetting about it&quot;, meaning: What ever you&#039;re trying to learn, practice it and then forget it totally (isn&#039;t most easy thing to do in the beginning, but gets a lot easier after awhile).<br />
<br />
I had nice chats with subc. before, but then I somehow &quot;forgot&quot; how to do it, but maybe he/she is still acting there background.. Maybe I&#039;ll try technique mentioned above, thanks for sharing it. One thing that might help all those with &quot;disorientation&quot; problems (was it with PSI, or anything else), try meditation if never tried it before. If one wants to focus on to a one basic thing (like practicing), I also suggest trying it in a state of trance (not that Armin Van Buurens&#039; radio show :P ).<br />

<br />
1. Company - If you imagine the subconscious as a person it would be able to keep you from becoming lonely. However, I would like to note that the subconscious cannot replace real human interactions (as far as I know of).<br />
<br />
2. Extra pair of eyes - Your subconscious is capable of picking up things that you missed before, ex. a fallen tree that can be used as shelter.<br />
<br />
3. Extra brain power - Your subconscious can help you think out your situations as long as you are calm, hence why all survival books tell you to stay calm.<br />
<br />
4. Regulating your body - Your subconscious notifies you which areas of the body are damaged, so that way you can fix them. Also it regulates your bodily temperature while you are experiencing different extremes.<br />
<br />
5. Programmed commands - Your subconscious is already running all of your bodily functions, why not add some psionic ones? Some things that come to mind are using TK to hunt, telepathy to broadcast an SOS type of signal, or sense any hostile animals/people around. The key is to be inventive, which in a survival scenario you need to put 100% of your strength into it (as long as it is efficient).<br />
<br />
6. Motivator - Your subconscious is a friend, an ally, and a part of you, so it knows that you are capable of surmounting any obstacle (it may take a while but you could). Since it knows this it is constantly cheering for you, and because of this you would be able to continue on without the need to give up.<br />

		<div id="post_12140" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">wow, this is a new method on communication with sub-con, and I&#039;m glad I read this. It sounds very interesting, and practical, and something that people can relate to. I&#039;m pretty sure we all heard voices in our mind, but most of the time I can only say those are my voices of thinking, but whenever I have nothing to do for a long time and gets really bored, my mind starts talking to me about what to do, hehe. Instinctively, perhaps my sub-con is even controlling me a little, to do the good things of course. Like when I donated over a dollar ^_^ for pennies for patients, never really expected those stuff from myself, I know its not much but that&#039;s not like me. When I play games I sometimes give away stuff and money, in good amounts, to friends, don&#039;t know why ^_^<br />
I thought my sub-con was controlling me after wards, but I didn&#039;t really care much b/c I&#039;m not doing anything bad to other people. But the actions I did are done instinctively, without thought, sometimes perhaps some thought but that&#039;s only to change my decisions. Like when I try to lack off it will cuss at me(jking) but it will make me do stuff, i think, not sure though maybe that&#039;s just myself lol.</div>

I had quite a few similar to those.
