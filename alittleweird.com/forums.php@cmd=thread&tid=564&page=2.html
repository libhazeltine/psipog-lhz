if i understand, inside the event horizon of a black hole, space is so warped, that if you travel in a strait line, you get back to the centre of the singularity.<br />

everyone is so absolute. they dont &#039;know&#039; whats gonna happen, they just think it wont destroy the world.<br />

Sure, its probably true that the &quot;true scientists&quot; have a lot more experiences, but it doesn&#039;t mean that they are always &quot;right&quot;. &quot;right&quot; can be defined in many ways, just like justice. It doesn&#039;t have a solid value, meaning that it can always be interpreted differently by various people.<br />

I don&#039;t really care who anyone actually believes, but I know my previous post demonstrated my ideas...And I want to stand up for myself...</div>Alright. What is right and what is wrong can be subjective a lot of the time, but it isn&#039;t wiht math and physics. Either your equation is right or it&#039;s wrong. It might only be wrong by a little bit, but it&#039;s still not right. Right and wrong in math and science are not wishy-washy.<br />
<br />
But I guess I see what you&#039;re saying...what if they think they&#039;re right, but they&#039;re really wrong? I doubt it--they&#039;ve checked over their equations, their machine, and pretty much everything else you can think of to make sure the machine functions properly and is safe for use. They say it&#039;s safe. And while it is conceivably possible that they&#039;re wrong, I really doubt something that has been so meticulously worked on and scrutinized for decades is going to have world-ending flaws.<br />
<br />
In any case, collisions like those that will take place in the collider take place in our atmosphere all the time. And besides, Hawking Radiation says the black holes should dissipate anyway. And to those who say, &quot;well, teh hawkin radaton arent proven&quot;...neither is gravity, or the big bang. It has a hell of a lot of supporting evidence, though--more than can be said for these shaky end-of-the-world theories.<br />

The accident was due to a miscalculation in basic maths that had been overlooked during four reviews. Pier Oddone, director of Fermilab, the American laboratory supplying the equipment, was quoted as saying: &quot;We took a pratfall on the world stage. We are dumbfounded that we missed some very simple balance of forces.<br />

They say it&#039;s safe. And while it is conceivably possible that they&#039;re wrong, I really doubt something that has been so meticulously worked on and scrutinized for decades is going to have world-ending flaws.[/quote]



while it certainly isn&#039;t world-ending, i do want to point out something i stumbled upon. take from it what you will.

[quote]on March 27 an explosion at the CERN site in a supercooled magnet caused so much damage that the start of the experiment had to be postponed until today. The accident was due to a miscalculation in basic maths that had been overlooked during four reviews. Pier Oddone, director of Fermilab, the American laboratory supplying the equipment, was quoted as saying: &quot;We took a pratfall on the world stage. We are dumbfounded that we missed some very simple balance of forces.

(however, i haven&#039;t found any official LHC sources that back this up. though i don&#039;t have much time right now to look, so it could just be that i missed it)

Even information, which can be separate from physical things, can be sucked into a black hole. Can PSI?<br />
