I sometimes try to do that by:<br />
1. closing my eyes<br />
2. see your head in front of you with a &quot;window&quot; on your forhead.<br />
3. in that window you see the keywords of your toughts<br />
4. see these keywords that aren&#039;t about the thing you&#039;re concentrating on coming out of your ears, and then vanish into the air<br />
<br />
anyways, I don&#039;t think gaming counts as &quot;something to occupy your mind in a way that you become absorbed it what your doing&quot; ^^;<br />

So if meditating helps you with telekinesis, then it is going to help with the others as well. And note, you don&#039;t actually have to meditate to perform psychokinesis, it can just help with holding clear states of mind. Like I said, I don&#039;t do it much, and manage PK fairly well.<br />
<br />
If the music helps you relax, then do it. However, it&#039;s not necessary, and might even hinder you by distracting you. Give it a go with and without, and see what is better for keeping your mind clear. Simple. =)<br />

I&#039;m going to try meditating now, with the japanese bamboo flute blowing softly. maybe I&#039;ll make a psi-ball during meditation? :3<br />
<br />
EDIT: holy crap! after 5 minutes of meditation I started to try to &quot;connect&quot; with the psi wheel. making it follow my hand. after a minute or 2 it kinda reacted on my hands movements. I could most of the time stop it, and make it turn around clockwise or counter-clockwise at will! When it stoped moving I tried to concentrate extra hard and then the piece of paper fell of the pin! I was like OH FUCK! and still now, my hands are shaking, and my legs too… anyways, I&#039;m almost sure it weren&#039;t air currents because it really followe d my hand most of the time and it moved so… special…<br />
now this is what I call proof that meditation can help you!<br />
but, I&#039;ll try again after dinner</div>

I&#039;m going to try meditating now, with the japanese bamboo flute blowing softly. maybe I&#039;ll make a psi-ball during meditation? :3

EDIT: holy crap! after 5 minutes of meditation I started to try to &quot;connect&quot; with the psi wheel. making it follow my hand. after a minute or 2 it kinda reacted on my hands movements. I could most of the time stop it, and make it turn around clockwise or counter-clockwise at will! When it stoped moving I tried to concentrate extra hard and then the piece of paper fell of the pin! I was like OH FUCK! and still now, my hands are shaking, and my legs too… anyways, I&#039;m almost sure it weren&#039;t air currents because it really followe d my hand most of the time and it moved so… special…
now this is what I call proof that meditation can help you!
but, I&#039;ll try again after dinner</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
