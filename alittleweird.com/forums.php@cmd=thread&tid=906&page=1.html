it seems as i have also no telepathic ability im 12 and am very interested, although i will need some telepathy training too, i read some articles on psipog.net :) - but id doesent seem very... (whts the word) adequate - no offence to article makers, but i find it that i need to be able to telepathically communicate - to learn how to make the force hallucination have a percent chance of working,   now the main idea or &quot;force hallucination&quot; is, um let me see, if any of you guys have played<br />
<br />
F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin, then you will definitaly understand, as i have said this is to no atacking means as stated above, please can someone help me :) - i am very interested into learning telepathy and hallucination via telepathical means, :)<br />

@eggman100<br />
I have never actually played F.E.A.R. It looks cool. I suppose it really is possible to get someone to hallucinate something like that. It would depend on the person, in my opinion. And I think you might have a better chance at hypnotizing someone into seeing that instead using Telepathy. I guess both could work, but I wouldn&#039;t really know.<br />
<br />
A word of advice, though. Since you are looking at doing something similar to what you saw in a video game, do not mix reality and the video game up. It can get really messed up if you do. Best of luck.<br />

1.) make a cloud of smoke as a virtualisation<br />
2.) make it a connectable cloud<br />
3.) when someone is in the middle of it that person is infected and believes whatever i tell them via that cloud as a remote control maybe<br />

but the problem with that is, i am saying &quot;What the Hell&quot;? - because i dont know if telepathy is real or the affect is, i guess it would be good to learn but - what is the point of thinking something is real if it isnt or is but cant learn it? :) - if you guys are still active and understand what i mean :)<br />

Overcoming disbelief can tremendously boost psionics. It&#039;s like every thought results in a construct and out of disbelief, you create constructs that stop or destroy the first constructs. Moreover, if you manage to overcome doubt, your old doubty constructs might still be there, doing their work.<br />

Just to let you know on a personal note, I&#039;m a girl... That&#039;s why my picture is of a girl...<br />
<br />
I understand what you mean by not believing. Psionics (and most other stuff talked about on here) is pretty hard to believe for the average person because it isn&#039;t &quot;normal&quot; or it doesn&#039;t &quot;obey the laws of physics.&quot; Seeing is believing, right? And of course youtube videos can easily be edited are not to be trusted, right?<br />
<br />
People who can perform or &quot;control&quot; empathy/telepathy/psionics/floating orbs have a certain powerful mental capacity or strength. They can do those things because they really set &quot;mind of matter&quot; to its max and make those things happen. Sometimes subconsciously, sometimes consciously. I&#039;m not saying only certain people have the ability to do it, but there are only a few who can really push unnatural to happen, using will power.<br />
<br />
It is hard to believe, and I&#039;ve never been able to do it. I don&#039;t practice and devote my time to it, nor do I have a strong mental capasity. But, I can believe that these things can happen.<br />
<br />
It depends on if you want to believe it or if you actually want to make it happen.<br />
<br />
As for the cloud of smoke that controls people, thats bordering on magic (without a k) and I think it would be safe to say that most people who practice psionics don&#039;t really focus on that.<br />

Holy crap, this thread is old!<br />
<br />
If you can keep yourself motivated, you can train yourself all alone. You just need someone to train on. You might think someone like that is hard to find, but actually look out of the window. I&#039;m sure there are a lot of people you can train with, or better seid train ON.<br />
So to train what you want to achieve, you just have to try plant a thought or feeling or whatever into your target. A friend of mine did it that way. he started while on his way to work to get people to do what he wanted. Mostly minor things like getting them to stop reading the news paper or opening and closing jackets. He also told me that once he made everyone in the train puke. Okay I don&#039;t believe that last part, or better I hope he didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
So that would be a way to train on your own, if you don&#039;t mind messing with peoples minds who didn&#039;t give you permission.</div>
