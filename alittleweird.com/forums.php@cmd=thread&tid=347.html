For example, in your case, perhaps you might ask, &quot;Why don&#039;t I have any good questions to ask?&quot;, which might lead to (for example), &quot;You struggle with the idea that there is meaningful truth.  The hypocrisy that exists in your mind is that everything is perfect just the way it is, versus the reality that there are certain things a mind must realize in order to better itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
To which you might reply, &quot;So what is the correct?&quot;, and maybe you hear, &quot;Where there are two conflicting truths, each of which seem equally correct, always have faith that both are true to some extent.  It is correct that things are perfect the way things are in this moment, and it is also correct that there is a progression of revelations a mind must go through to better itself.  You can&#039;t think of any meaningful questions because you are attached to the idea that things are perfect now, and applying that truth incorrectly.  Things are perfect now as a result of perfect execution of cause and effect.  The correctness of this moment is only correct in terms of how it&#039;s come about from previous decisions.  It&#039;s those previous decisions that are imperfect.  Incorrect decisions, with correct execution of cause and effect, lead to suffering in the &#039;now&#039;.  Instead of focusing on the perfect execution of cause and effect, instead focus on how you can make better decisions.  Then you&#039;ll be able to find all sorts of questions to ask.&quot;<br />

That&#039;s what I hear at least :-P.<br />

...okay I just answered my own question. Your imagination is all fantasy brought up by triggers that happen in your life to think that. For example, if you&#039;re playing a game or reading a book, you sometimes think of different ways for something to happen or for someone to answer a question, and other weird things. Your subC usually focuses on reality and try&#039;s to use science or reasoning to explain everything. Unless it gets tired and tells you &quot;IT JUST DOES!&quot; My mind has done that before. <br />

Numbers are perfect. Mathematics is perfect. Some numbers are just too perfect for our own understanding, so we explain them the best we can. Its the people that mess up the perfectness and simplicity of Numbers. (sorry, I turn to math as an escape away from emotions and unclear answers.)</div>

However, I disagree. Of course, as the years go by, we develop more concret explanations in Math, but that&#039;s just the same as Science. However, mathematics are never perfect though we strive to make them damn close. That&#039;s because we rely on them so much. If mathematics were perfect, someone would&#039;ve easier explained everything by now. But we can&#039;t. Or maybe it was our system of mathematics to begin with that needs revising? Who knows. Math cannot be perfect. Math is the product of man, and man is completely and utterly imperfect. <br />

And that&#039;s why we all live. We strive for perfection, even though we ourselves are not and by no means ever will be. :D</div>

The one that we use today is in a base 10 format, we use only 10 numbers total. <br />

0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-X-Y-Z<br />

The Fact of the matter is that with either system, you are getting thesame rules, the only difference is that one is in another base. <br />

A semi Famous Reference to 42 in The hitchikers guide to the galaxy and the other books by the same author.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you Get When you Multiply Six By Nine?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Answer, in base 10, would be 54, however, if you use 13 base multiplication, it would equal 42.<br />
<br />
Also, Why is Zero not a number, Isn&#039;t every number just a placeholder? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the numbers or the math that is imperfect. It&#039;s Humanity that is Imperfect, It&#039;s not theat the math or the numbers are worng, it is just that Observation, i.e, the human element, which is imperfect.<br />
<br />
Dividing any number y zero equas zero, it&#039;s just that when you follow the algorythms developed by human observation, we end up with 0.0einfinity. This doesn&#039;t mean that it was the math or the numbers that were wrong, It means only that the original observation was incorrect or overlooked that issue. It&#039;s just Convention that allows us to say that any number divided by zero will equal zero because it makes logical sense in multiple situations, just like when you are dealing with any number to the power of 0, which will always equal one. This works because of the situation below.<br />
<br />
x(y^0)=x             not y or 0<br />
<br />
for example (try this on your calculator if you want)<br />
<br />
15(3^0)=15<br />
<br />
The point I&#039;m trying to get across: Eerything is perfect, and therefore nothing is perfect. To say otherwise just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br />
