It can really suck if you have been laying there for 30 mins and waste it by falling asleep. <br />
<br />
  One thing that you can do is leave the lights on, and have some rock ( not soft rock) playing quietly in the back ground. You can also think very vividly violaent thoughts, althought thats not recommended as much when your in the trancive state, since it can really mess up your mind :-P<br />

(I didn&#039;t have an OBE til now, so I&#039;m just assuming)<br />
<br />
By the way, last night I think I was pretty near to my first OBE. I felt this strange feeling like my body was pumped up full with energy and that feeling grew stronger and stronger. I also saw strange hypnagogic imaginary (looked like really strange and evil creatures). after a while (I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t get to excited) the feeling faded and faded, pretty fast til it was almost gone. A already had that a lot of times, but this time the feeling was much stronger than ever before. Anyone an idea what I may have done wrong?</div>

I don&#039;t think that having rock playing in the background and thinking vividly violent thoughts is not necessary.<br />
<br />
You could just meditate until you feel that your body is asleep and then somehow try to move out.<br />
Or you could try to induce the pre-OBE feeling.<br />

At least that&#039;s what I think - I haven&#039;t experienced a full OBE myself.</div>

.. Thers a simple way to astral project. It&#039;s called the 4 in the morning technique. Set your alarm to 4 am, when you wake up you should be in a groggy state. quckly throw some cold water on your face and go back to bed in a couple minutes. When you are back in bed constantly say to yourself, astral projection, then move your sense of awareness to outside your body. just keep on doing this until you either fall asleep or project..<br />

It would be nice if I could tell my body to go into autopilot and then use the lifting technique anyway.<br />
