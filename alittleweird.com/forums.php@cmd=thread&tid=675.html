<br />
   Okay, so I was sitting at my computer desk with my psi wheel it was covered with a plastic dome that came with my blank CDs. I was bored and not that focused on moving the PSI wheel. I Lifted the dome a little on one side to put a finger in it (this helps for some reason, but keep in mind that my finger was not touching any part of my PSI wheel). I told myself in my head that me and the psi wheel are part of each other and can affect each other with our strong connection. Then I &quot;asked&quot; it to move, I didnt tell myself which way, just that I wanted it to move. After a few minutes of expecting it to move and &quot;asking&quot; then it started to act strangely, it shaked around, it span but only in quick burts(not constantly).<br />
<br />
*NOTE*: there was no source of wind and if there was it was mostly covered by a dome.<br />
<br />
Do you think I did it?</div>

I dont know how to make people get it, but psi wheels will move on thier own uncovered. Plastic jars also make static. Use a glass jar, and no hands. </div>

When it&#039;s static, the psiwheel should soon get balanced and stop moving. It should move again only if the dome is moved or when one of them is recharged, I think.</div>

My recommendation is find an alternative. Find something that&#039;s light, doesn&#039;t have much friction, and has less probability of it being influenced by outside forces. An example would be trying to move a toothpick in water.</div>

He wrote a book called outliners. Its basically about famous people like bill gates and hockey players and famous groups like the beatles.It talks about the things that lead up to their fame. One principle seems to be they had 10000 hrs of practice at what they did to be great.And the guy basically states if you spent 4 hrs a day practicing your talent it would take about 10 years to get 10000 hrs in.WOW thats WAY too long for me personally the way I am doing it to get awesome results.I don&#039;t know about anyone else but I think I need to rethink my strategy to incorporate psi training into an activity I already do and intensify it somehow to get even close to acceptable results.Practice practice practice :)</div>
