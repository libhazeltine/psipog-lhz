Lol: Stealth camoflage! I&#039;m not sure if that would happen, but it seems like a possibility. There is really only one way to find out. But, hey, even if that is the case, it&#039;s still better than nothing. I might comment on all of that emotional material another day perhaps. And, Akio, I should be able to ask you those questions about psychic reception, but I do not know when I will get to it. I will be sure to ask them in a thread when I have seen that you have made a recent post. </div>

Would you require some kind of light beaming out of you in order to see when you are invisible through this method? Would that cause you to be visible again? <br />
<br />
There are to many problems with this Idea of invisibility, I prefer Active camoflauge. Basically, you just wear a ton of cameras and projectors that make up your whole body. each one the size of a computer pixel. These would then recieve info from opposite sides of the body and projects them out. In effect causing light to pass right through you while at the same time hitting you so you could see while being invisible. </div>

Fair enough.

Ditto :).

Good God...before we know it they will be selling Metal Gear Rex prototypes on the black market. It looks like your game is becoming a reality, Mr. Kojima.

		<div id="post_9046" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey, sorry I didn&#039;t get back to you sooner Wandering Wolf... I read your post this morning but I was really at a loos for what to say ^_^.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think that you are over complicating things to an extent. All 4 of the examples you have given could be used via either method. There are only two differences that one may see between Psychic Reception and the more refined form in which I am going to call Psychic linking for short.<br />
<br />
In the following, I will discribe the differences between the psychic reception forms and the psychic linking forms of each.<br />
<br />
1.) This first one would most likely only fall under the psychic reception form, because to link means to have contact with someone, and at this point it is unlikely the woman has had any contact. This however can be written down to certain key points that can be found in the mans picture, it may look &quot;false&quot; to her. This means that we cannot accurately say this is a psychic phenomena.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, since I don&#039;t believe in intuition as true phenomena because I do not believe that there is any true coincidence. Which leads me to believe that there is something that told her that this man is not what he says he is. I would call this Psychic reception, or otherwise something that could be rooted down to the picture.<br />
<br />
2.) In this case, the best way I could discribe this to you is to say that the person was using reception, picking up on little details, bith psychic and not, that are setting off warning signs in his head. Since the person in question is probably in denial, his subconcience sends out a message heard in an audio form in his head telling him what he is denying to himself. The Ego is a little too present for my liking in this case, but it can be riddles down to Reception, maybe psychic, maybe not.<br />
<br />
3.)This has a possibility of being linked to psychic linking, but it is more likely Psychic reception because he is getting a feeling, not seeking for information. I&#039;ll explain later on in my post.<br />
<br />
4.)Clairvoyance is both a form of Psychic reception ad linking at the same time, in reality, you are recieving the information from without a link, but thaen establish a link in the middle of the effect. This is really something I consider psychic reception simply because it is more often a recieved, not sought for, vision.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With each of these, they could all be called Psychic reception. The Reason is because you are recieving psychic information, not establishing a link in order to gather that type of information. <br />
<br />
To Clarify, It is said that we have always had the ability to recieve information, information like you have said above. The Difference between Psychic Reception and Psychic Linking is That Psychic Linking is much more refined. To explain more, I could say that Psychic linking came about when man tried to harness the abilities he possessed. Empathy and Telepathy fall under the category of Psychic linking because they require one to focus one&#039;s abilities (this increases the range to infinite amounts because one can focus on anything anywhere). Ofcourse, there are forms of empathy and telepathy (some you have mentioned above) that have limited range because they don&#039;t require the focus that the Psychic linking, or true forms of empathy and telepathy would require.<br />

Your additional explanation proved very helpful. I think I am beginning to understand what you have been getting at all of this time. I really don&#039;t know what to say about psychic intuition though. It is difficult to exemplify psychic intuition with such examples, so I can partly understand why you disagreed with it. Psychic intuition is better exemplified with situations involving seemingly automated actions that yield a desired (or undesired) result, such as a sniper firing his or her rifle at just the right time to hit a quickly moving target that would have been nearly impossible to land a shot on otherwise.</div>

In other words, what you would call psychic intuition I would call one hell of an amazing shot.<br />
