		<div id="post_7196" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;"> I&#039;ve never had any luck with intentional psychokinesis, but I do seem to speak clearly with my subconscious from time to time, as well as living my daily life with frequent synchronocities. Those aside, the only real concrete experiences I have had are OBE vibrations and recently an unexplained incident. These things said, I  wanted to address  a few things here:<br />
<br />
Are OBE vibrations a natural part of sleep? If they are, they don&#039;t validate a paranormal event for those who haven&#039;t had a successful attempt.<br />
<br />
I continously try to &#039;feel&#039; an outcome and then look at the result to see if it&#039;s true. The problem with this is, I get it wrong as often as I get it right, and many of the times when I&#039;m right there really is no distinction that I TRULY did anything at all. Of course, I have had my days where I just know something real has happened. I think one problem is that I choose things that are too arbitrary.<br />
<br />
 Synchronocities are essentially odd coincidences, but they have happened to me as of late to such an extent that I can&#039;t really trust that they are real in any way. Sometimes I feel like It has become second nature for me to take anything I see and make it a &#039;synchronocity to me.<br />
<br />
Basically, all of my supposive experiences are very deniable, so I often feel it is hard to advance.</div>

Most recently I had asked my subconscious to make something &#039;spectacular&#039; happen on that particular night, and later when I had awoken from sleep and got on the computer, a large clump of metal clothes hangers in my closet sporadically smashed around unprovoked. I got up to check and see if anything had fallen off them or from their ranks. At first I thought that maybe one of the clothes hangers had been balanced on top of another and then after however long finally slipped off and caused the ruckus, but this was proved wrong when I attempted to recreate that and it barely made the hangers jiggle as opposed to a full out SMASH.</div>
