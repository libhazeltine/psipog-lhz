Their is also the fact that the more that ya are healed by a method, the more resistance that ya can find. This resistance is often felt in different ways, sometimes like ya said. The thick gel-ish feel. </div>

		<div id="post_15589" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve felt varied resistance when doing remote healing. As well as a few other interesting occurrences. <br />
<br />
Most of the time it depends on the illness and the condition of the person. The common effects I experience are:<br />
<br />
  -Resistance (type #1), this usually happens with people, who, by whatever means, have an excess of energy, commonly this will feel like when you try to push a two magnets together with the same poles facing each other.<br />
<br />
  -Resistance (type #2), A &#039;gel-like&#039; feeling or murkiness to the flow, this usually happens when people are sick with something specific and physical in nature (like a cold) where there natural flow of energy seems to slow. At first it usually feels like you&#039;re pushing through gel. After further observation however (keep in mind this is based purely on my experience), I have come to see it more as the current only being able to move so fast. The gel-like feeling is actually resistance to the speed you are pushing energy in.<br />
<br />
  -Pull/attraction (type #1), This is much like the &#039;Resistance (type #1)&#039; mentioned above, but rather than the poles being the same, they are opposite. That being so, the energy seems to be attracted to the body. Usually this is a result of an undercharge of energy (in this case I would usually look for any &#039;leaks&#039; in the energy system or anywhere where grounding is occurring).<br />
<br />
  -Pull/attraction (type #2), This is hard to distinguish from the other form mentioned except that, rather than exponential increase in pull based on proximity, it is linear. In other words, instead of being measurable by y=x^2+bx+c, it is measurable via y=mx+b. This is (again in my personal experience) because of the natural energy flow of the person you are working on is faster than your own.<br />

  -Synchronicity, This is the rare event that someone actually has the same energy flow as you to, as well as the same charge.

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_15589">I&#039;ve felt varied resistance when doing remote healing. As well as a few other interesting occurrences. 

Most of the time it depends on the illness and the condition of the person. The common effects I experience are:

  -Resistance (type #1), this usually happens with people, who, by whatever means, have an excess of energy, commonly this will feel like when you try to push a two magnets together with the same poles facing each other.

  -Resistance (type #2), A &#039;gel-like&#039; feeling or murkiness to the flow, this usually happens when people are sick with something specific and physical in nature (like a cold) where there natural flow of energy seems to slow. At first it usually feels like you&#039;re pushing through gel. After further observation however (keep in mind this is based purely on my experience), I have come to see it more as the current only being able to move so fast. The gel-like feeling is actually resistance to the speed you are pushing energy in.

  -Pull/attraction (type #1), This is much like the &#039;Resistance (type #1)&#039; mentioned above, but rather than the poles being the same, they are opposite. That being so, the energy seems to be attracted to the body. Usually this is a result of an undercharge of energy (in this case I would usually look for any &#039;leaks&#039; in the energy system or anywhere where grounding is occurring).

  -Pull/attraction (type #2), This is hard to distinguish from the other form mentioned except that, rather than exponential increase in pull based on proximity, it is linear. In other words, instead of being measurable by y=x^2+bx+c, it is measurable via y=mx+b. This is (again in my personal experience) because of the natural energy flow of the person you are working on is faster than your own.

  -Synchronicity, This is the rare event that someone actually has the same energy flow as you to, as well as the same charge. I won&#039;t deny that it can happen but I can&#039;t deny that it is very rare. It would in theory feel like you were working on yourself, other than that, I can&#039;t say anything about it.

There were two of us meditating in the tent on a cold summer night. When the other guy woke, he was violently shaking because it was too cold. I was alright and channeled some energy to warm him up. Well, he started feeling better as I gradually started to feel the cold, but I could no longer stop the energy flow. So, we both ended up in running inside the house to get some warm. =D</div>
