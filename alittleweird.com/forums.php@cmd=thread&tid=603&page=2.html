This is so far the only video that has worked for me. I don&#039;t trust him because on one video, he claims to help you make a chi &quot;heat&quot; ball. He tells you to do a bunch of visualizations which seem legit, until he then says to stick out your palm, and then he claims he will move it around and spin it on your palm. Everyone kept saying how they could actually feel him spinning it, but to me this is obviously some form of suggestion or hypnotism. The video WAS NOT a live performance, so how the hell could he have been moving the chi ball? That&#039;s just it, he wasn&#039;t. It&#039;s all in your head.</div>

<br />
If you try as HHAAARRDD as you can, you&#039;re not going to get as far as if you bent over, and relaxed and let gravity do its work. And slowly pushed it further. Not to mention, by doing this &quot;haarrdd&quot; try, you did loosen up a little, even though you tensed up :-P<br />

So, naturally, attempt number 2 you&#039;re going to go further...<br />

This guy is not legit.<br />

He&#039;s trying to sell you things.<br />

<br />
Science is more than asking questions and making guesses. Science is attempting to prove those things with controlled experiments, measurements. These things are beliefs, highly subjective. Do you honestly think you are using a Chi Ghost Clone of yourself In a Parallel Universe? Or, perhaps, by slowly stretching out and loosening up your muscles, you are operating on a purely biological and physiological principle that helps reach further?<br />
