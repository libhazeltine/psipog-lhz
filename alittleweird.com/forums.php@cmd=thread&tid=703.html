		<div id="post_13338" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">There are a lot of articles on the internet about what would happen in 2012 and to be honest i dont believe that a disaster or something like that would happen, what i do believe is that humans are evolving into humans with special abilities, a kinda like the marvel world. Its a feeling i&#039;v had all my live. <br />
<br />
Some maybe would think, &#039;why dude&#039;, well when i was young a dog was running after me and i was so scared and without knowing what happend i was running really fast i lost balance and broke my arm, the weird thing is when i was running it was like a blue mist inside me was giving me a lot of energy. since then i feel something inside is present. a year after that i had a OBE, i thought i would die, it was like my soul wanted to leave my body, and i&#039;v had this experiency twice in my live. For years i was thinking why did it happend to me and whats wrong to me. so yesterday when i again was thinking about it i searched with google. I typed &#039;soul leaving body&#039; and then i found  the site of PsiPog. I just coudnt beleive when i was reading the article of OBE, and while looking at the site i found the psiball section, it shocked me they where talking about the method of taking energy of the inside, in the form of a blue ball.<br />
<br />
So people, what do u think of it, do u think that it could be possible that in the future a lot of people would have special powers?<br />

Why not?
Isnt 2012 as good as any year for it?[/quote]

I have to concur. Why not 2012? I understand what you are saying ed., since that is pretty much the only way to make sense of Nostradamus, and some of his predictions, no one knows how to make heads or tails of.
