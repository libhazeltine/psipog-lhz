		<div id="post_11002" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey, I&#039;m back here at my home after a bit of a vacation... I&#039;m just getting myself situated here as I type this. It&#039;s really amazing, but I have a lot to tell after my trip, including some ghostly encounters. With that being said, lets get to work!<br />
<br />
First off, was my first day on the trip. I was staying at my grandma&#039;s house (which happens to be in the area of town with alot of paranormal activity around it.) I have reason to believe I was attacked by a Psi-Vamp Spirit while I was there, as I lost quite a bit of energy there, and for days I was unable to retrieve the lost energy. On top of the fact that I had many childhood instances there involving ghostly encounters and other paranormal activity, this made me wonder what exactly was causing the high level of activity at the house, and what exactly was causing such a high concentration of activity for that matter.<br />
<br />
So I&#039;m leaving the Discussion up to you. The important things to note are as follows;<br />
<br />
1. There is a cemetery in that neighborhood, a fairly old one at that.<br />
<br />
2. Many of the buildings that have high activity have their own wells, My grandmas is confirmed to have abnormally high nitrate levels in the area.<br />
<br />
3. I noticed that my grandma has a huge amount of reflective surfaces, at least 2 in every room. Mostly Mirrors, but there are a few partially reflective surfaces like polished wood and glass.<br />
<br />
4. the Spirits at my grandma&#039;s house seem to be in distress or hostile.<br />
<br />
5. My grandma uses many white surfaces and she also collects Angels<br />
<br />
6. There are a large level of electronic devices at my grandparents house, but not as much as is at my house, and I document less paranormal activity here than there.<br />
<br />
7. I&#039;m not a paranoid person, all of what I said is just an observation, and it is up to you to come to the correct conclusion.<br />
<br />
One other thing to note is Feng shui. This is something I am researching in the moment and it may shed some light as to what is going on. With that being said, I wanted to bring this up to discussion.<br />

		<div id="post_11013" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Reflective surfaces have been connected to ghostly activity... Primarily the Idea that mirrors reflect light, and have a tendency to trap spirits in a location... white surfaces also reflect light. So I thought it was important to include these things.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, The Paranormal and mirrors have been intertwined for a long time. Bloody Mary may be considered a very small &quot;ritual&quot; with mirrors. And there are plenty of historical ghosts that &quot;live&quot; around mirrors, so to speak. <br />
<br />
So, the main reason is that mirrors and any kind of reflective surface may have an effect on ghosts.<br />

One other interesting thing I found about the house. The man who previously owned it built the house from the ground up. Before he could finish the whole house, he died. Apparently, There was heightened paranormal activity in the area until my grandparents fixed up the house. <br />
<br />
Since then, when my parents were young, they stayed at my Grandparents house. One interesting is to note that I had an experience with seeing a dead relative there. I cannot guarantee that I acctually saw this, as I have no memory of the event, however; my family told me this myself, and they have no reason to lie, so the only reason I ever have questioned the credibility is because it has become effectively heresay.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
There are more interesting personal experiences that I&#039;ve had, but related to the house is primarily a sense that something was there... I&#039;ve also seen half-images, they are things I can see in front of my face, but are only partially visible. This has occurred around therefor years before I could really see aura&#039;s. Now I tend to see human-like auras around the house in no particular place for no particular reason. <br />
<br />
Shadow people are also significant at the house. In the sense that people have experienced this kind of activity there from time to time.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really sure if this helps anyone, but more information is usually helpful. Good luck ^_-<br />

your account of the house has many strikeing similarities to my grandmothers house.<br />
She has a well, not as many reflective surfaces, but still a good amount. no graveyard near by either. and i have also noticed a &quot;person&quot; some times at night, walking around the corner of the hallway. i currently live with my grandmother and see this man almost every 3 nights. my older sister used to have encounters with a small girl, the man we never discovered who he is but the girl was named victoria. these spirits have been in the house for a number of years. as was another vague entity with no definite form, this one has not appeared for around 7 years, and the girl left the house when my sister moved out. the man still appears, though i&#039;ve never gotten a good look at him i have seen him many time. He gives off a very unnerving presence. so unnerving i even put up a powerfull shield to keep him out of my room at night. also, my grandmother has a good amount of electronics aswell.</div>

		<div id="post_11078" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I haven&#039;t used a powerful shield in quite a while... my house (or rather, my parents house) seems to be naturally shielded and to have it&#039;s own resonance of energy. I want to more know about the house itself, but it really does seem like there has been a lot of love in the house itself.<br />
<br />
A few spirits hang around inside the house, but they seem to all be kind ones. The only creepy thing in the whole house is the windows... spirits that peer in to the windows. These are the ones that seem dark in nature, but that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a natural barrier... and the only time something menacing has made it through the barrier is on occasions where I am studying information from the darker side of the occult. (i.e satanic rituals as went on in the underground network of tunnels beneath a few churches, some ritualistic uses of the necronomicon produced by &quot;Simon&quot;, etc.)Even then, that seems to be along the lines of &quot;you bring power to all that you acknowledge&quot;<br />
. (hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil)<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough I learned to gather energy from my house, it&#039;s pretty interesting when I can set up things that I normally wouldn&#039;t be able to do ^_^. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, most of what has happened as of yet is pretty minor, I&#039;m glad that my energy is restored from the attack now and that&#039;s all that matters for me.<br />
<br />
and for the Kirby saying of the day <br />
<br />
(Rule 34 when applied to string theory is a very scary, but intriguing thing to think about when doing a Google Search...) <br />
