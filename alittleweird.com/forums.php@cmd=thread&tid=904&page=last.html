Earlier today i had gotten into a fight with a good friend of mine and it was starting to get a bit heated. Now im not sure if ill ever talk to her again but while i was taking a shower, i had sudden flashes of torturing people or animals like cats or dogs. And as i was starting to snap out of it, i had noticed a slightly visible aura...it looked black and kind of like steam...but it couldnt have been the water because it wasnt in the least bit hot. Rather cold i might add. So...am i turning evil or something? I should also mention that i was incredibly angry and rather sad at the same time. Please lemme know what you think. Peace (no pun intended...if there is even a pun in it)</div>

Auras can change.<br />
So for me nothing unnormal concerning your Aura.<br />
<br />
About your &quot;torturing flashes&quot;: -maybe just random thoughts just because u were raged and looked for some kind of revenge.<br />
<br />
But if  you will keep on thinking stuff like this for a longer period of time.<br />
I would suppose to go into Yourself and search for the reason of these kind of thoughts.<br />

I was extremely depressed and when I made quick movements, I&#039;d see a dark aura kind of following behind, like a black afterimage.

Sometimes, I was, say, typing, and I could swear I saw it move as I typed, as if my fingers were disturbing that dark &quot;steam&quot;...<br />

I&#039;ve been better now, but I tried looking at it again out of curiosity the night before last and I saw it again. It was a lot weaker, though. My guess is it&#039;ll appear if you&#039;re in a dark mood; kind of like a reflection of your emotions. It&#039;s weird though, that no one else would&#039;ve talked about this...</div>

The thoughts come from your anger, of course. It is an easy way for your mind to let off some steam, and cool itself down. I will have dark demented thoughts all the time when I&#039;m mad, or when I think of something that makes me mad.<br />
<br />
No, you are not turning evil. If you do not completely enjoy torturing and plan on doing it in the future, you are not turning evil.<br />
<br />
The darkness I have less of an explanation for. It could be your aura that you saw, it could have been the light playing with your eyes. But, I would not worry about it too much. <br />
<br />
If you do not like the evil thoughts, do not allow yourself to think them, seriously. Just get your mind off of them.<br />
<br />
@Kube<br />
Seeing movements of the &quot;darkness&quot; while you type seems to me like your staring at the computer screen too long, and having nothing to do with the dark aura.<br />
<br />
However, that is just my logical opinion.<br />
