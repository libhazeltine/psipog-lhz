Not necessarily. There are different kinds of entities. Why can&#039;t there be different kinds of demons? Consider an imp. <br />
<br />
So more than one idea could potentially be correct if there are different kinds of demons.</div>Well...I was assuming that the general theories about where demons exist and how they exist would be the same for all types of demons. Let&#039;s say that an Imp lives on one Astral Plane while umm... *thinks of all sorts of video games* a Gremlin lives on another plane. The fact is, they would both be on some sort of plane, so the theory would then be: Demons exist on different planes. You are just being overly specific about each and every demon.<br />
<br />
Saiya, what you are experiencing is completely normal and it is said that no normal person can truly clear their mind until he/she has practiced enough to be able to do so. Meditation is the practice I speak of. The meditation I used to do back in the day is from the old Psipog days, check it out if you like.<br />

It is a great beginner&#039;s meditation where you just have to sit still and not move. Since it is a beginner&#039;s meditation, you don&#039;t actually have to force your mind to be clear. Once you become good at it, and have practiced it enough, clearing your mind will become easier than it was in the past.</div>

It is a great beginner&#039;s meditation where you just have to sit still and not move. Since it is a beginner&#039;s meditation, you don&#039;t actually have to force your mind to be clear. Once you become good at it, and have practiced it enough, clearing your mind will become easier than it was in the past.</div>Thanks. Though I&#039;m not sure if I actually have the will power to sit there and and not do anything even remotely stimulating without getting extremely impatient and frustrated. I&#039;ll probably attempt it, but I doubt I won&#039;t give in. Unless I am very tired, I can rarely go without moving without my body becoming very uncomfortable. Another thing I want to blame on my age. But anyways, I suppose at this point of stagnation, I&#039;ll try anything to astral project. I think I&#039;ll try the meditation on weekends before I go to sleep.</div>

Well...I was assuming that the general theories about where demons exist and how they exist would be the same for all types of demons. Let&#039;s say that an Imp lives on one Astral Plane while umm... *thinks of all sorts of video games* a Gremlin lives on another plane. The fact is, they would both be on some sort of plane, so the theory would then be: Demons exist on different planes. You are just being overly specific about each and every demon.

Saiya, what you are experiencing is completely normal and it is said that no normal person can truly clear their mind until he/she has practiced enough to be able to do so. Meditation is the practice I speak of. The meditation I used to do back in the day is from the old Psipog days, check it out if you like.

It is a great beginner&#039;s meditation where you just have to sit still and not move. Since it is a beginner&#039;s meditation, you don&#039;t actually have to force your mind to be clear. Once you become good at it, and have practiced it enough, clearing your mind will become easier than it was in the past.[/quote]

Thanks. Though I&#039;m not sure if I actually have the will power to sit there and and not do anything even remotely stimulating without getting extremely impatient and frustrated. I&#039;ll probably attempt it, but I doubt I won&#039;t give in. Unless I am very tired, I can rarely go without moving without my body becoming very uncomfortable. Another thing I want to blame on my age. But anyways, I suppose at this point of stagnation, I&#039;ll try anything to astral project. I think I&#039;ll try the meditation on weekends before I go to sleep.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

You&#039;re immediately putting yourself in a negative postition, so you&#039;re only making it harder for yourself. You have to be positive, you can do it.  <br />
<br />
Age? Well, I believe I was about 16 or so when I first tried out motionless meditation. It was indeed hard, and in the beginning I could only do about 20 minutes. But, I perservered, and kept working hard until I was eventually able to do 2 hours. I may have done 3 hours once, I&#039;m not really sure though. I had many amazing experiences while doing this meditation and I have to say, I was in my best physical and mental state possibly because of it. <br />
<br />
Although, I just suddenly stopped one day and have not truly done it again in a few years. I&#039;m gonna try to start it up again sometime. Maybe I can accomplish my all-time goal of 24 hours of meditation? I always wanted to accomplish that...<br />
<br />
Well, good-luck :)</div>

I want to add something useful about demons and spirits, but I&#039;m also &quot;very new to this &quot;study&quot;.[by Faceless]&quot; so ye, these are &quot;assumptions.&quot; (well more like common sense) You honestly think that demons who just come out of no where and take over you. I don&#039;t see why, and even if they want to-----for no reason....I don&#039;t see how they can take over your entire life, I&#039;m sure you can come back. Besides, I like to think of demons as helpless creatures have no where to go, I never really did see them, but that just makes it fun to think of them that way. I used to be scared of them too, I imagine them at the every corner of darkness. <br />

		<div id="post_13415" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Just a suggestion on getting rid of irrational fears. Rationalize them away. <br />
<br />
For example, if I were afraid of getting stuck in a refrigerator, It might go like this.<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: Be careful when you open the fridge door.<br />
<br />
Logic: uh... why?<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: You might fall in and get stuck inside.<br />
<br />
Logic: OH NO!!! *thinks* wait I&#039;m too big to fit inside a fridge.<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: uh...<br />
<br />
Logic: and even if I was, I could simply push the door back open.<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: *implodes*<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re afraid of hell, meditate on things like: &quot;a loving wouldn&#039;t send anyone to hell&quot; &quot;hell doesn&#039;t fit any crimes that can be committed.&quot; things like that.<br />
<br />
Just whatever you do, don&#039;t repress your emotions, that will go like this.<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: Be careful when you open the fridge door.<br />
<br />
Repressor: ROAR!!! SHUT UP FEAR!!<br />
<br />
Irrational Fear: But you might fall in and get stuck inside.<br />
<br />
Repressor: ROAR ROAR ROAR *digs hole and buries fear* Hurray, for now I am brave and shall have no fear, well I&#039;m going to go play in traffic.<br />
<br />
Fear: ... mph mph<br />
<br />
And if you don&#039;t die in the traffic, it will build up until:<br />
<br />
Fear: *bursts out of the hole* bwahahahaha, you buried me and tried to kill me, WELL NOW I SHALL RULE YOUR LIFE, SLEEP OUTSIDE OR YOUR HOUSE SHALL FALL ON YOU, WAIT SLEEP INSIDE SO YOU DON&#039;T GET BITTEN BY A BROWN RECLUSE OR A BLACK WIDOW WAIT BROWN RECLUSES CAN BE INDOORS!!!!!!!!11111ONEONEONEONE.<br />
<br />
Trust me, It&#039;s happened to me. Except with anger.<br />
