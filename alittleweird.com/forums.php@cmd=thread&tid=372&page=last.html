		<div id="post_8251" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The topic of lucid dreaming has often been associated with New Age, psionics, OBE&#039;s, etc. But is there really anything that should put lucid dreaming in this category? Lucid dreaming has become the focus of some scientific and psychological research over the past few decades. Ever since the discovery of REM sleep in the 50&#039;s, dreaming in general has been studied more in depth. Lucid dreaming is merely becoming aware that you&#039;re dreaming while you are, and potentially having the opportunity to take control of your dream. Whereas some other topics of &quot;weirdness&quot; may assume breaking laws of physics, lucid dreaming really doesnt seem too out of the ordinary. So what do you think- is lucid dreaming a &quot;weird&quot; topic, or has it been misappropriately labelled and is actually quite normal?<br />
<br />
NOTE: forgive me if the writing is bad- I&#039;m doing this at 1 in them orning and I&#039;m very tired but cant sleep.</div>

It would be a lot easier if you tell us what you label as weird.<br />

If you think something is weird when you don&#039;t understand exactly how it works, everything would be labeled as weird.<br />
However, if you think something is weird when it&#039;s supernatural or something like that, I wouldn&#039;t say lucid dreaming is weird, this isn&#039;t supernatural, we just don&#039;t understand all the facts nature gave us.<br />
For me personaly, there aren&#039;t really &#039;weird&#039; things in the world, sometimes I think: &#039;Wow! That&#039;s weird!&#039; (When I made the Psiwheel move for the first time for example), but when thinking about it, you&#039;ll realize that it&#039;s all very natural.<br />

But, I could believe it is related to dreams. Think about the last time you dreamed something. What you dream is usually related to what you experienced in that day. that doesn&#039;t always mean it has to be everything that you experienced, just some things. I believe if you &quot;control&quot; your dream, it does interfere with the memory transferring. Try to remember the last time you had a dream. Now, try to remember all of it. Most of the time, the only parts you can remember of the dream are the parts where you &quot;controlled&quot; the dream, or yourself in the dream. Because your mind is transferring memory, its too busy to record the dream you have. If you focus in on the dream, your mind will start to record the dream, so to speak.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never really done any research on dreams or anything like that, but its always been a fascination of mine. All of the information stated above comes from experience and thinking logically. ^.^</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_8549">I&#039;ve never really heard about transferring sort-term memory to long to memory banks as you sleep until now. But, I could believe it is related to dreams. Think about the last time you dreamed something. What you dream is usually related to what you experienced in that day. that doesn&#039;t always mean it has to be everything that you experienced, just some things. I believe if you &quot;control&quot; your dream, it does interfere with the memory transferring. Try to remember the last time you had a dream. Now, try to remember all of it. Most of the time, the only parts you can remember of the dream are the parts where you &quot;controlled&quot; the dream, or yourself in the dream. Because your mind is transferring memory, its too busy to record the dream you have. If you focus in on the dream, your mind will start to record the dream, so to speak.

I&#039;ve never really done any research on dreams or anything like that, but its always been a fascination of mine. All of the information stated above comes from experience and thinking logically. ^.^</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
