		<description>Isn't it a waste of energy to worry about whether reality, beliefs, thoughts, etc are real or not?  All known life forms exhibit behavior that appears to be designed to lead to some sort of progress, such as evolution.  Obviously, not all evolutionary steps have been effective, or "correct".  So what, then?  Does this mean that it is pointless to try, or that there is no inherent value in striving for our own evolution?  Absolutely not.  It may be impossible for us to verify reality as we are, but the only way we will have a chance at determining what is true is to push forward and work towards progress, however we choose to define it.</description>

		<description>Wow, I had no idea you posted this! :P kind of ironic. I recently wrote about this after I came across Steve's post. That's pretty funny. I agree with you here though, which is what makes me stumbling across this post so entertaining to me.</description>

		<description>QED: Quod erat demonstandum, what was to be proved.

"If I reject an idea, then I reject reality, because that idea has been created in reality."

WTF. Take a break, that's the stupidest thing I read today.
I can reject the content of an idea, but still can I accept, that reality has born this idea. This works, for objective and subjective thought patterns.

I don't even need to judge the idea. I can just acknowledge its existence. This is of course not practicle, accept if you are some sort of buddhist.

This discussion is very philosophical, but I get the feeling, that, like with most theoretical abstractations, its highly inpractical.

The view of a reality is just a tool needed to grasp what surrounds us. This tool is created and adapted by ideas we have about how stuff works. And progress is definded by how good this tool works, ie. how much it corresponds to what seems to happen arround us and in what sense it makes us comfortable with the life we are living.

This also explains the existence of religion (explaining the inexplainable), the confrontation between religion and science, and the emergence of science as a quasi-religion.

So in fact, reality is subjective. Even Kant proved it, more than 200 years ago.

And if we reject an idea, it's because it hinders us from seeing reality in the most practical way, based on our expectations and beliefs.

The question that arises now is of course, how to measure progress, individually and collectively. I don't know and give it back to you.

That's just the crap in my head. please prove me wrong. :P</description>

		<description>Could it be possible that even though reality is subjective there could be some objectivity?

Because if we perceive everything as subjective, how do we know that objectivity does/does not exist?</description>

		<description>If it's about progressing or such things, I agree it suggests the current state is less or incorrect. This is a function of duality. Dualities exist in a subjective sense but not in an objective sense. The universe is objective, subjectified by the mind, colored by our culture, beliefs, etc, based on our experiences. I would suggest that it comes down to experience, which implies some form/function of consciousness in which to experience. What is it that we are to experience? Universal Truth, not tainted by subjectivity as best can be done. Is it not consciousness that gives rise to duality? Yes it is. Then how does one experience Truth objectively? The mind has to be taken from reality, made devoid of stimuli as much as possible, while maintaining awareness. You simply can not get there from here. The consciousness needs to be altered, less it maintain the same subjective, dualistic views.</description>

		<description>i see better what your saying now, but i'm still not convinced.

yes, beliefs do imply a separation from the self and the belief, but does that really matter? the way i see it, it only matters if the self is necesary for that belief to be true. if i have a belief about the way the world works, and it happens to be true, it will be true weather i am around or not, so does it matter if i am separating the self from the belief, when the belief is independent of the self?

but its interesting, striving for 'true' beliefs is not a necesary part of existence. i can believe whatever was taught to me first, and i would be able to continue to exist weather those things are true or not (within reason. i cannot survive with incorrect beliefs about survival skills). weather i believe in god or not, or weather i conform to latest beliefs in quantum mechanics or not, it has no impact on my ultimate survival.

so maybe progress does exist, and there are 'better' beliefs in terms of truth, but it is not 'necesary'</description>

		<description>Personally I have to disagree with you on what you say about beliefs in your post above mine, Sean. There are many things that we still do not know; our purpose in life, an afterlife or nothing, whether God exists or not, and the list can go on to infinity. These are unknown, so most people decide whether they think a certain belief is true because they need something tenable to hold on to. Also each person has their own beliefs based on how they perceive and interact with reality.

People will knock heads, but because they knock heads does not mean that everything they say is false. I used to be a determinist, until I took a Philosophy 101 course over the month of January. In that course I realized that there has to be some sort of free will, but there were some pieces of determinism that have to exist as well. How they can fit together I do not know, but I believe that a creator God has the knowledge of how these things can coexist. You may argue about whether a creator God exists or not, but that is alright because only I can change my beliefs and perceptions of reality.</description>
