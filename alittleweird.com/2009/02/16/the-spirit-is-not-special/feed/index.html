		<description>I think the "spirit" is what carries on after our actions. The ripples we leave in the waters of causality. The little influence we may have in our daily lives. The DNA we pass on in our children.

There is always life after death. You die; your body rots and structured organic matter becomes plain old matter again, perhaps to be picked up by more living organisms. So life goes on.</description>

		<description>Despite being able to program pretty much anything I like, I still think computers are pretty neat. Having experienced metaphysical events, I also only find them to be that much more interesting. Learning how something works shouldn't make it less special. If you have a passion for the subject at hand, you should be that much more excited to forge ahead and do something even better with your new knowledge.</description>

		<description>If matter is indeed, just an illusion; then, that would make your brain an illusion as well.. (rather than the word "illusion" you could say hollogram). And if this illusion is your valued life, then what is it that gives anything meaning? A soul?

I think that a living person is a consuming entity, much like a fire, and as long as we have fuel, we will keep on radiating energy. Biological reproduction is like passing the flame onto another torch, via offspring.

Ok, so we are consuming fuel, changing energy into different states and all that - similar to fire - but what does comparing conciousness to fire say about our ego?

Does one fire think that it is a completely different fire, just because it is burning on a different piece of wood?

Fire is the same any time it is fire..

Same as conciousness/soul.

Lo-HAHA!! Synchronicities are the adventures of universal evolution!

		<description>What is your Dangerous Idea? Edited by John Brockman. The book is basically a collaborative text written by a bunch of "leading scientific minds" about what their "most dangerous ideas" are. Which I must say is very fascinating, because it not only shows what most of them are working on, but it also points a finger towards where these potential Frankensteins might lead.


The following I quote from one of the scientists (Robert Shapiro) in the book. (upon closer inspection I've found he is a ...senior research scientist in the Department of Chemistry )


"1953... ...Stanley Miller... ...demonstrated that a mixture of small organic molecules (monomers) could readily be prepared by exposing a mixture of simple gases to an electrical spark. Similar compounds were found in meteorites, which suggested that organic monomers may be widely distributed in the universe... ...James Watson and Francis Crick. They demonstrated that the heredity of living organisms was stored in a very large molecule called DNA. DNA is a polymer, a substance made by stringing many smaller units together as links are joined to form a long chain... ... the geometrical beauty of the DNA double helix, led many scientists to consider it the essence of life itself. One flaw, however, spoiled this picture: DNA could store information, but it could not reproduce itself without the assistance of proteins, a different type of polymer. Proteins are also adept at catalyzing many other chemical reactions considered necessary for life... ...Which came first: DNA or proteins? An apparent answer emerged when it was found that another polymer, RNA (a cousin of DNA), could manage both heredity and catalysis. In 1986, Walter Gilbert proposed that life began in an RNA world-that is, when an RNA molecule that could copy itself was formed, by chance, in a pool of its own building blocks. Unfortunately, a half century of chemical experiments have demonstrated that nature has no inclination to prepare RNA, or even the building blocks (nucleotides) that must be linked together to form it..."

We don't know how life started right now, the idea that we're simply a biological mass is an unprovable theory, something rather stupid to say especially when you're interested in looking for answers and not spouting ridged dogmas. I don't think the quote I posted points towards a creation theory because I think it is possible to find the missing link that theoretically started this whole shebang. However I'll quote another book where the author has also done his research.

"To make sense of the world at all, our scientists are, furthermore, now forced to talk about a reality founded on the notion of a ten-dimensional hyperspace-the idea that there are other dimensions or invisible layers beyond the world we know. There is no proof for this, of course; but only by supposition does reality become feasible. Without it, the world as we think we know it could not exist. But by believing in something they have no evidence for, our scientists have, in fact become theologians."

From the book: Plant Spirit Shamanism, by Heaven Charing. 

I'll say from an anthropological/scientific standpoint all cultures practice magic(k) and/or supernatural things. All cultures also say they get results from said practice, beit purely psychological or actually magic(k)al. I do not have enough evidence to convince anyone anything, because you 'skeptics' have your pre-determined ideas about life, that is in fact very anti-science, and sounds more like blatant dogma to me.</description>

		<description>Hey, I've sent you an email. Some of the ideas you're saying I've thought about myself. It's refreshing to finally see someone else doing the same thing.</description>

		<description>This is really riddled with a lot of fallacies Sean; I'm disappointed. For example, you imply that since the universe says no energy is destroyed or created, death is only an illusion. What if our minds were created from the order and complexity held in our nervous system? That order and complexity can definitely be destroyed. Is the difference between life and death, entropy and antientropy?</description>

		<description>I know that time is in a way related to the mind. However, if this reality is truly a real reality (in contrast with virtual realities and such), there are other people who are actual people and not machines, and these people can perceive time, then time must be related in some way to the physical universe.

And I personally find Steven's post about the spirit intriguing...</description>

		<description>First of all, trying to discuss the "mechanics" of time in forums like this is like trying to teach a toddler how to drive a car. You would need to have some sort of knowledge  in Metaphysics If you even want to begin to understand how time works and all that jazz. You'll find a wide range of books, that talk about philosophers of time, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Ernst Mach, and even Sir Isaac Newton. They all theorized on what time was and how it influenced us. There are also tons of books on metaphysics which I think you would find pleasantly orgasmic, seeing as how you like to question reality a lot. 

However, I think your notion of time resembles a lot like what Albert Einstein had said. He basically stated that time is in fact not real. It is only a construct of the mind. Not only that, he also said space was a construct of the mind. Both time and space are merely embedded into our minds because of how we perceive things. However, it is inhuman for us to see things in any other wayay because not having a concept of time or space is like being 3/4 of the way dead. This is why it is extremely difficult for us as humans to grasp this concept.</description>
