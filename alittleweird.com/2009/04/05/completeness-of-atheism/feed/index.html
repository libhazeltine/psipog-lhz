Yeah I agree evolution can be the way God made things. In fact the entire Creationist/Evolutionist argument is insane. Each party argues how they are in the right and bashes everyone who opposes them. However, since they are so focused on the nitty gritty details they ignore the fact that our universe was made. How it was made is unimportant, because we still have the same universe, the same planet Earth, and the same human race! What is important is that we care for our world in every way that we can, rather than getting caught up trying to defeat one another's personal views!</description>

		<description>Well the problem with that is, is can not be known whether or not that theology had a perfect perception of reality. And people would still argue over it, because they would still want to prove that theirs is right, and the others are wrong.</description>

		<description>What if there were a theology that did have a perfect perception of reality? It'd be pretty boring since nobody would have anything to argue about :/</description>

		<description>Well, evolution can actually be argued for the existence of God actually. Even though that flies in the face of what is normally accepted in most religons.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19956961/

And I think another part of the inconsistency is spirituality, it is inherent in the human condition. So can not really be removed. Sure you can take away religon and that might have some impact, since most religons give you your jumpstart in that area of your life, but can exist independently, and can arise that way, at least to a degree.

So even if you get rid of the idea of God, people are still going to believe and have faith in something. Whether it be science, or Atheism, since Atheists do have to have some faith and belief that their system is true. Because science can not prove anything is the absolute truth, all it can do is sprial closer and closer to it, but most likely never reach it.</description>
