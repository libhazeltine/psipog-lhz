		<description>What I hate about psionics is its nonlinear nature and almost chaotic way it operates.

Lets take precognition.

I tried establishing a protocol for a simple as hell, boolean based communication with my subconsciousness:

This A sensation for TRUE.
That B sensation for FALSE.

Question: "Is this randomly selected card RED".
&#62; A. 
Follow up: "Is it Diamond?"
&#62; B
Follow up "So it is Heart?"
&#62;A

Turning the card over would reveal it to be so.

Did not take very long for me to encounter bizarre situations like A and B reversing roles, even in the middle of sequence of queries :O

How can I trust a service, when protocol can shift meanings during run-time?  I tried tracing the problem back into my subconscious workings to deduct the real question that got relayed.

Verbal question: "Is it red"
Unconscious metaquestion : "I assume its black"

So if I receive answer TRUE for the verbal question, I would have to flip the value according to that hypothetical question that subC is answering. From SC to SC basis 

So if "I assume its black". statement is FALSE
but the conscious question was "Is it red?".
The damn thing returns FALSE instead of TRUE.

To this day, I havent been able to make it reliable enough to do anything serious with it. :(</description>

		<description>psionics is peculiar indeed.. i have only experienced a few situations, but the ones which brought me here shook my reality pretty hard..

Since looking at the objective nature of reality, I have found that infinity is the reason any of us are here..

look at how the golden ratio is built on the same ratio as the fibonacci sequence, which is a formula for a conventional feedback loop.

The foundation for life is similar to that of microphone feedback..

(this model spirals outward in all directions.. I will try to be short and sweet with my comment)

Infancy..

just when you think you know it all.. bam.. another layer of reality peels back, and you are born again.

Infinity applies everywhere.</description>

		<description>I think some of what is in the book, The Intention Experiment can go a long way towards explaning psionics, and partially, the mind.</description>

		<description>I love how you said "For the cursed..." It's almost scary how much the term cursed can fit into this whole equation. The thoughts, the questions, the answers we don't believe are answers, just simply motivational pieces to continue moving forward... it all fits so well.

I find it funny though, because the more I dig myself into this hole of self discovery, the more I realize it's impossible for me to surface. I've already let that thought go, however. I just think that it has both good parts and bad. The good is that I'm motivated, and literally have no choice but to keep digging until I hit gold or come out the other side.

The bad news is that I've realized how our own beliefs, our own experiences, literally shape our perception on "fact." I've learned that even if someone hands one of us a study with solid evidence, we will still question, we still will not be content, or happy. We will feel as though there is still more to the puzzle, there has to be, because some how, some way, everything is connected and it's just too big to be tangible. 

It's just ironic, really. We say that we're pursuing "self discovery" or "advancement," yet, that end goal isn't even the motivation. It's part of it, but the journey DOWN this path is what makes everything worth while. The frustration, admiration, excitement, insert other emotion here...

:P Great post, I can fully agree with you on this one. Oh and yeah, sorry for the long reply, you just rubbed me the right way Seany Sean. lol.</description>
