		<description>Very interesting, Sean. +1 for Atheism.

This shows that a simple system can lead to complicated, inpredictable outcome. Colliding atoms lead to complicated molecules, lead to a single celled organism, and the rest we know of.. =)</description>

		<description>That problem again no! Can't stand the headache *dies out*.

What would a robot see? But then when we see what the robot saw it's like not having the robot... The question that leads from Schroninger's cat is very annoying.</description>

		<description>Ouch.

You just "contaminated" a perfectly good test setting :P

Now that you described "emergence" as an eventual result from running simulation, what keeps users from unconsciously "willing" such phenomenon to occur? We are dealing with several random throws here after all.

Does emergence exist because it does, or does our expectancy cause it?</description>
