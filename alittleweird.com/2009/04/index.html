				<div class="entry">
					<p>I have two thoughts to express:</p>
<p>1. In <a href="26/hacking-reality/index.html">identifying the unknown in the Atheist belief system</a>, I realize I haven&#8217;t really accomplished anything, and have just come full circle.  My conclusion is that the best way forward is to experiment with reality in order to convert unknowns into knowns&#8230; which is what I thought before I started this line of reasoning.  The only benefit I&#8217;ve gained is deflating the ego and arrogance of the Atheist&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t get me any closer to truth.</p>
<p>This makes me think that all belief systems have a realm of the unknown.  In the Theist belief system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">&#8220;God&#8221; is used to catch</a> a lot of these unknowns.  In the Atheist belief system, the edges of science showcase the unknowns.  Particularly for our time period, quantum physics.  Rewind a hundred years, and it was the atom.  Fast-forward another hundred, and we&#8217;ll have unknowns about the things we invent to explain quantum physics.</p>
<p>At this point, even if we discover the theory of everything, it operates at such a low level that we cannot predict what is possible and what isn&#8217;t.  And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever discover a theory of everything!</p>
<p>Pursuit of knowledge and understanding is important&#8230; but it is never ending.  And I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;never ending&#8221; in the poetic sense&#8230; I mean it in the literal sense!  Hmmmmmm.</p>
<p>Moving on to my second thought&#8230;</p>
<p>2. My biggest complaint about science is how inaccessible it is.  If I wanted to contribute, I would have to make a career out of it.  Stay in college, study under a professor, learn advanced math, draft articles for peer review, etc.  And even then, I could work my whole life, and never discover anything of worth.  I feel as though it would take me a decade or two just to get up to speed with what&#8217;s currently going on.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a shame.  I think it&#8217;s great that people <em>do</em> do that&#8230; because I certainly enjoy hearing what they have to say about things.  But I hate that &#8220;truth&#8221; and &#8220;unknown&#8221; has been sectioned off from the public, and isolated to a select few nerds, speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p>Why is it that I can&#8217;t study reality?  Why do I have to hold certain qualifications?  It&#8217;s both science&#8217;s strength and weakness.  By rejecting laymen, they can search further and more accurately&#8230; but in doing so, distance themselves.</p>
<p>We <em>all</em> live in reality.  Not just the scientists.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense that I need to be smart to understand reality.  I am reality.  Here I am.  Intelligence is just a particular organization of reality&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t make sense that reality has to be in a particular organization to understand itself.  In fact, it seems as though if we force understanding to exist on an intellectual level, then we are destined to never understand reality completely, because it will always be in organizational form.  Never direct knowing.</p>
<p>That is the injustice of science.  We are reality&#8230; everyone.  You can&#8217;t monopolize understanding.  You can&#8217;t deny our existence.  You create a world that doesn&#8217;t include us, and pull out your devices and instruments that <em>we</em> created, and assert dominion!  Back the fuck up, buddy! <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I wonder how often it occurs to the scientist that they aren&#8217;t solving some math problem with billiard balls bouncing everywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>The microscope is pointed in the wrong direction.  &#8220;Learning is not the path.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve really been <a href="05/completeness-of-atheism/index.html">struggling</a> lately, trying to piece together a consistent view of reality.  With the introduction of emergence, I&#8217;ve finally understood the Atheist belief system.  It sounds a little silly, because I can look up Atheism in Wikipedia, and I should be able to just understand the idea instantly.  But I&#8217;ve discovered that I need to really immerse myself in an idea to truly understand what it&#8217;s saying - and this process can take weeks or months.  These past months I&#8217;ve been focusing on Atheism, and a few minutes ago I feel I&#8217;ve finally graduated it.</p>
<p>Let me start by paying respect to this belief system.  This Science+Emergence+Evolution concept is beyond revolutionary.  I hold deep respect for people who truly study, understand, and apply this belief system in their lives.  (Perhaps this &#8220;deep respect&#8221; is just a way to inflate my own ego, since I still use this belief system!)</p>
<p>The issue I had with Atheism is that I&#8217;ve experienced paranormal phenomenon.  The modern Atheist would argue that such experiences are delusions.  After all, if these experiences are real, then it really flies in the face of what Science and naturalism tells us.</p>
<p>I see that line of reasoning&#8230; and 20 minutes ago, I had no way to counter it.  I felt utterly confused; unable to reconcile my experiences with such a strong belief system.  Atheism offers so much explanation to what we experience, using reason, logic, and evidence, that it is an insurmountable beast.  In the world of Atheism vs. Theism, Atheism wins.  Sorry folks.  The personal God simply does not exist - or at least - the things we witness do not need a personal God to explain.  We can explain 99% of modern experiences using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_pantheism">naturalistic lines</a> of reasoning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that remaining 1% that is of interest to me, though.  The modern Atheist will simply ignore it, because it&#8217;s such an asshole.  It ruins everything.  If that 1% didn&#8217;t exist, Atheism would rein supreme.  But it does exist.  And I finally have a framework for accepting its existence.</p>
<p>Atheism shows us that - given a system with certain characteristics - life will naturally emerge.  Numbers self-organize, on their own.  All that&#8217;s required is a system flexible enough to sustain it.  For example, we already create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_loops">digital life using computers</a>.  It&#8217;s not as complex as life in this reality, but as time moves on and computing power increases, we will be able to create more stunning simulations.</p>
<p>The point here is that: Given a flexible enough system, life will naturally emerge.</p>
<p>So, the reality we live in is currently flexible enough to sustain life (obviously).  So, we witness life.  The atoms have formed molecules, which have organized themselves into viruses and cells, and further organized into community of cells, and multi-cellular organisms, and evolved via natural selection and other undiscovered mechanisms, until finally it&#8217;s you sitting in front of your screen, reading this sentence.</p>
<p>All of that.  Sitting <strong>on top</strong> of this flexible system.</p>
<p>Where does the paranormal fit into this?  Simple.  It&#8217;s experiences specific to this particular system.</p>
<p>The best example I can give is to think back to the digital life.  The programmer creates a flexible system, runs the simulation, and then life naturally emerges from it.  Now, imagine that the programmer has a bug in his code.  The life could literally find ways to hack the underlying system, and experience things that would seem &#8220;paranormal&#8221; to the digital inhabitants.  However, these &#8220;hacks&#8221; are very specific to the system.</p>
<p>The point here is that: The specific system that OUR life is built on might have some neat features that we are unaware of.</p>
<p>So&#8230; in conclusion.  The Atheist belief system is a perfect model for describing how life is created, how it just follows natural laws, and self-organizes on its own.  The Atheist model is simply true - given a system with enough flexibility, life WILL evolve.  It&#8217;s a mathematic truth.</p>
<p>However, in our particular instance, we aren&#8217;t really talking about any willy nilly flexible system.  We are talking about <strong>our specific system</strong>, that has life built on top of it.  The Atheist model is correct, but it still doesn&#8217;t say anything about our specific system.  It can&#8217;t.  All it says is that our particular system is an example of a system flexible enough to support life.</p>
<p>Just like the digital life could &#8220;tap into&#8221; the system that is beneath it, so too can we tap into the system we are built on.  Who knows what lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Atheism has solved a profound problem of thought concerning life and nature.  It has provided us with an amazing ability to explain the vast diversity of our experiences.  However, beneath the surface, there still exists the dark corner of the unknown.  Perhaps I do exist after all.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>What is the concept of &#8220;emergence&#8221;?</p>
<p>First, we create a system based on simple concepts, and simple rules.  For example, suppose we have an image.  We initialize the image with a random color at each pixel.  Then, we randomly choose a pixel, and copy it&#8217;s color to a random neighbor.  We repeat this process over and over again.</p>
<p>What emerges from these simple rules?  It&#8217;s actually pretty cool to watch&#8230; the image starts to look life-like.  At first it&#8217;s just random colors everywhere, but soon little pockets of the same color start to emerge.  These blobs start small&#8230; but over time, they grow and shrink, and move around.  They split in half&#8230; some die off completely.  If the simulation is left to run long enough, sometimes two dominant colors emerge.  They battle each other.  One color might shrink down to a small section, only to expand again.  Eventually, given enough time, one color will take over the entire image.</p>
<p>Why not take a look?  <a href="../../emergence-game.php.html">I created a simple game</a> where you can see emergence in action.</p>
<hr />
<p>So what&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>There are a lot of points.  The main point is that it exists.  Given just some numbers, and some simple rules, unpredictable properties emerge.  It&#8217;s not a question of &#8220;faith&#8221; or &#8220;opinion&#8221; or anything like that.  Emergence exists.  It&#8217;s mathematically proven.</p>
<p>Big deal, numbers simulate stuff&#8230; nothing fantastic.  What does it mean?</p>
<p>It actually means quite a lot, but it takes some more before we get to that point.  The first step is to recognize its existence, and understand that - given a large enough system with some basic rules - <em>things</em> start to happen.  And by <em>things</em> I mean <em>life</em>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>What is &#8220;Psionics&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Psionics&#8221; is an umbrella term for a variety of paranormal and psychic abilities.  Skills like Telepathy, Psychokinesis, Remote Viewing, Out-of-Body Experiences, Energy Manipualtion (Psi Balls, Shields, Constructs), Empathy, and Precognition.  The reality behind these skills is unknown, and they could all rely on different mechanisms to actually work, but they are still grouped together under the term &#8220;Psionics&#8221; simply due to their paranormal/psychic classification.</p>
<p><strong>Is it real?  Are you crazy?</strong></p>
<p>Since Psionics is an umbrella term, the &#8220;realness&#8221; of each skill has it&#8217;s own body of literature.  My personal experience and research, over the past decade, has led me to conclude that all the skills mentioned above are real.  Of course, I could just be a nut, or just making a few honest mistakes, so who cares what I think?</p>
<p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>
<p>For the few reading, I want you to take a step back.  What I mean by that is I want your mind to stop moving so much.  Instead of thinking about psionics, or about a particular skill, or how cool it would be, or how silly it all is, or all the questions&#8230; just stop.  Stop moving.  There is plenty of time to think about whatever you want after you&#8217;ve finished reading this article.  But for now, at the end of this sentence, just stop.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to freeze your body or breath.  Please, by all means, breathe normally, and relax your muscles.  Just stop thinking so damn much.  I&#8217;m not trying to put you in some voodoo trance or anything, I just need you to drop all your preconceived notions for a few minutes.  After you finish reading, you are free to restore all your beloved notions, so don&#8217;t worry :-).</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Puzzle</strong></p>
<p>After talking to thousands of people about psionics, I&#8217;ve noticed that there are two puzzles.  The first puzzle is obvious: is psionics real?  If so, how do I do it?  How does it work?  What about science and physics?  What about religion?  Am I insane?  This is the puzzle we try to solve.  This is the puzzle that we set our sites on, and work towards.</p>
<p>The second puzzle is hidden.  It&#8217;s the puzzle we&#8217;re <em>actually</em> solving, while we <em>think</em> we&#8217;re solving the first.  It is the puzzle of mind and meta-thought.</p>
<p>As long as the second puzzle remains unsolved, the first puzzle will always exist.  If you truly want to cease the questions in the first, you must solve the second.</p>
<p><strong>Not-Self Denial</strong></p>
<p>What happens, though?  We focus on the first, and because the second blocks our path, eventually we tire out and move on to something else.  But the second puzzle always remains&#8230; it infects everything.  Our limits, in any field, psionics or otherwise, is governed by mind.  It is only until we push hard enough that we notice this limitation.  Perhaps psionics will be the subject that motivates you to push that hard.  Probably not, though.</p>
<p>What will <em>probably</em> happen is that psionics will spark some curiousity, which will give you some fire for a while.  Maybe only enough motivation to finish this article, or maybe enough to read some more.  For the few, psionics will motivate beyond reading, and spark us to try some exercises out.  For the cursed, psionics might become a vessle for self-discovery and deeper understanding of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution of Psionics</strong></p>
<p>Show me a question, and I will show you an insatiable mind.</p>
<p>The evolution of psionics is the transition of focus from the external world to the internal.  I need you to make this transition, because your thoughts are killing me.  They&#8217;re killing you.  Just stop.  Stop.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t.  So run away&#8230; move on to something else.  Run as far as you can, until mind reaps another casulity.  Psionics was never really for you anyways.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>With the combination of <a href="../../2008/09/20/self-replication-vs-truth/index.html">evolution</a>, <a href="../03/10/emergence/index.html">emergence</a>, and recognizing that the <a href="../02/16/the-spirit-is-not-special/index.html">mind is responsible</a> for the illusion of the world, I have stumbled upon a near-complete model of reality.  I find myself saying things I&#8217;ve heard come out of the Atheist&#8217;s mouth.  We don&#8217;t need a God to explain&#8230; anything.  We can offer a more robust explanation using the Atheist&#8217;s concepts.</p>
<p>The Atheist has created a beautiful model of reality, really.  It offers concrete answers to strange observations, and makes solid predictions about the future.  It can answer more questions than any other system of beliefs I&#8217;ve come across.  It is simple, elegant, and complete.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what bothers me :-).</p>
<p>First, let me state that Atheism is far better than any other modern theist belief structure.  It is light-years beyond Christianity, in my opinion.  Not that I don&#8217;t feel Christianity serves a useful purpose&#8230; I&#8217;m comparing the beliefs based on which offers more reasonable explanations.  I.e., Evolution appeals to reason more than the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>That being said, I find myself really upset with ESP and out-of-body experiences all of the sudden.  They really ruin this perfectly complete Atheist model.  I mean&#8230; they profoundly ruin it.  By giving special exception to consciousness, we&#8217;ve invalidated the beauty of Atheism.  The Atheist&#8217;s reply is to <a href="../02/16/the-spirit-is-not-special/index.html">remove the special exception</a>, restoring beauty to it&#8217;s model.  But to be honest, I&#8217;m not really sure we can do that.</p>
<p>If I could ignore ESP and OBEs, I&#8217;d be a perfectly content Atheist right now.  But damn it all to hell if reality hasn&#8217;t ruined it.</p>
<p>Incomplete or inconsistent.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel&#8217;s curse</a> remains.</p>
