		<description>Ok, so it was wrong of NeoPsychic to assume that Antisankari hasn't studied calculus.

But since Antisankari counters that claim by mentioning the degree he is studying for, the point still stands ... that without a degree there is little reason to assume someone has a good background in science.

Of course there is nothing to stop someone from self studying science (if they have the motivation). And if you choose a research area which doesn't require expensive laboratory equipment (for example math, for counterexample genome sequencing) you can even do research on your own and get journal papers published. And if you manage to do that, your lack of degree will probably no longer matter. But it's definitely a more difficult route, and requires a lot more self study and therefore self discipline.</description>

		<description>Yep.
I know nothing about computers or Calculus. :(
Poor me studies merely Computer science / Math at the University.

Yesterday they showed me how to turn on a computer. I failed since I could not find the start button. Next course has to do with moving the mouse...</description>

		<description>"Diplomas and accomplishments are much like tags in a military uniform."

Diplomas give a rough idea of a person's knowledge in a field. Military tags are based on experience more or less. You don't get to become 

"You can boss people around even if you don’t have em, but don’t expect anyone but the weakest to comply."

Don't be a fool. Scientist "boss" people around because if I tried to tell you how a computer works in relation to binary and quantum physics described in calculus, you I doubt you would be able to understand. Scientist end up dumbing things down because some of the things that are researched go way over the heads of most people. That's why scientist debate scientist over the proper mass of a neutron and not the 7 year old down the street.

Science begins with investigation, trials, and experiments. You can provide help to the scientific community but you better have water tight proof. Look at similar research and figure out ways to make it more solid and spend a few years researching with multiple people and you can get results.</description>

Same with science. When you have enough metal near your collar, people will listen to you no matter what fruitcake thing you present. Mainly because they assume that you already have the proof to back it up.

Without any credentials... Well.. Nobody just cares.</description>

		<description>Well just because you are not a professional scientist does not mean you still can not try to understand reality experientially, since a lot of what science did in the first place was try to explain the experiences that people were having, and most of the time, looking at what had already been observed by the layman. And sometimes the culture can impose certain ideas onto science that may get accepted into mainstream.

Science is behind in many things, and is just now getting around to looking at things that have been claimed for centuries or thousands of years that the layman knew but science had yet to recognize.

So it is not that you can not have an impact on science, it will just take a while for it to be felt. But hey, at least we all learned something and will continue to learn as we share in your journey Sean, while thinking about our own.</description>
