			<div class="entry">
				<p>I have two thoughts to express:</p>
<p>1. In <a href="../../26/hacking-reality/index.html">identifying the unknown in the Atheist belief system</a>, I realize I haven&#8217;t really accomplished anything, and have just come full circle.  My conclusion is that the best way forward is to experiment with reality in order to convert unknowns into knowns&#8230; which is what I thought before I started this line of reasoning.  The only benefit I&#8217;ve gained is deflating the ego and arrogance of the Atheist&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t get me any closer to truth.</p>
<p>This makes me think that all belief systems have a realm of the unknown.  In the Theist belief system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">&#8220;God&#8221; is used to catch</a> a lot of these unknowns.  In the Atheist belief system, the edges of science showcase the unknowns.  Particularly for our time period, quantum physics.  Rewind a hundred years, and it was the atom.  Fast-forward another hundred, and we&#8217;ll have unknowns about the things we invent to explain quantum physics.</p>
<p>At this point, even if we discover the theory of everything, it operates at such a low level that we cannot predict what is possible and what isn&#8217;t.  And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever discover a theory of everything!</p>
<p>Pursuit of knowledge and understanding is important&#8230; but it is never ending.  And I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;never ending&#8221; in the poetic sense&#8230; I mean it in the literal sense!  Hmmmmmm.</p>
<p>Moving on to my second thought&#8230;</p>
<p>2. My biggest complaint about science is how inaccessible it is.  If I wanted to contribute, I would have to make a career out of it.  Stay in college, study under a professor, learn advanced math, draft articles for peer review, etc.  And even then, I could work my whole life, and never discover anything of worth.  I feel as though it would take me a decade or two just to get up to speed with what&#8217;s currently going on.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a shame.  I think it&#8217;s great that people <em>do</em> do that&#8230; because I certainly enjoy hearing what they have to say about things.  But I hate that &#8220;truth&#8221; and &#8220;unknown&#8221; has been sectioned off from the public, and isolated to a select few nerds, speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p>Why is it that I can&#8217;t study reality?  Why do I have to hold certain qualifications?  It&#8217;s both science&#8217;s strength and weakness.  By rejecting laymen, they can search further and more accurately&#8230; but in doing so, distance themselves.</p>
<p>We <em>all</em> live in reality.  Not just the scientists.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense that I need to be smart to understand reality.  I am reality.  Here I am.  Intelligence is just a particular organization of reality&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t make sense that reality has to be in a particular organization to understand itself.  In fact, it seems as though if we force understanding to exist on an intellectual level, then we are destined to never understand reality completely, because it will always be in organizational form.  Never direct knowing.</p>
<p>That is the injustice of science.  We are reality&#8230; everyone.  You can&#8217;t monopolize understanding.  You can&#8217;t deny our existence.  You create a world that doesn&#8217;t include us, and pull out your devices and instruments that <em>we</em> created, and assert dominion!  Back the fuck up, buddy! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I wonder how often it occurs to the scientist that they aren&#8217;t solving some math problem with billiard balls bouncing everywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>The microscope is pointed in the wrong direction.  &#8220;Learning is not the path.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Well just because you are not a professional scientist does not mean you still can not try to understand reality experientially, since a lot of what science did in the first place was try to explain the experiences that people were having, and most of the time, looking at what had already been observed by the layman. And sometimes the culture can impose certain ideas onto science that may get accepted into mainstream.</p>
<p>Science is behind in many things, and is just now getting around to looking at things that have been claimed for centuries or thousands of years that the layman knew but science had yet to recognize.</p>
<p>So it is not that you can not have an impact on science, it will just take a while for it to be felt. But hey, at least we all learned something and will continue to learn as we share in your journey Sean, while thinking about our own.</p>

<p>You can boss people around even if you don&#8217;t have em, but don&#8217;t expect anyone but the weakest to comply.</p>
<p>Same with science. When you have enough metal near your collar, people will listen to you no matter what fruitcake thing you present. Mainly because they assume that you already have the proof to back it up.</p>
<p>Without any credentials&#8230; Well.. Nobody just cares.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Diplomas and accomplishments are much like tags in a military uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diplomas give a rough idea of a person&#8217;s knowledge in a field. Military tags are based on experience more or less. You don&#8217;t get to become </p>
<p>&#8220;You can boss people around even if you don’t have em, but don’t expect anyone but the weakest to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a fool. Scientist &#8220;boss&#8221; people around because if I tried to tell you how a computer works in relation to binary and quantum physics described in calculus, you I doubt you would be able to understand. Scientist end up dumbing things down because some of the things that are researched go way over the heads of most people. That&#8217;s why scientist debate scientist over the proper mass of a neutron and not the 7 year old down the street.</p>
<p>Sean</p>
<p>Science begins with investigation, trials, and experiments. You can provide help to the scientific community but you better have water tight proof. Look at similar research and figure out ways to make it more solid and spend a few years researching with multiple people and you can get results.</p>

			<p>Yep.<br />
I know nothing about computers or Calculus. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
Poor me studies merely Computer science / Math at the University.</p>
<p>Yesterday they showed me how to turn on a computer. I failed since I could not find the start button. Next course has to do with moving the mouse&#8230;</p>

			<p>Ok, so it was wrong of NeoPsychic to assume that Antisankari hasn&#8217;t studied calculus.</p>
<p>But since Antisankari counters that claim by mentioning the degree he is studying for, the point still stands &#8230; that without a degree there is little reason to assume someone has a good background in science.</p>
<p>Of course there is nothing to stop someone from self studying science (if they have the motivation). And if you choose a research area which doesn&#8217;t require expensive laboratory equipment (for example math, for counterexample genome sequencing) you can even do research on your own and get journal papers published. And if you manage to do that, your lack of degree will probably no longer matter. But it&#8217;s definitely a more difficult route, and requires a lot more self study and therefore self discipline.</p>
