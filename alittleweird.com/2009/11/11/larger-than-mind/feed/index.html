		<description>Sean,

My opinion is that their is nothing LARGER THAN MIND.  Our mind is like a baloon.  As you fill more air it will grow larger. If their is no air it is smaller.  When it comes to GOD, if we fill the GOD in our mind, it will become GOD.  For this we need not give any shape,structure, etc., As it fills in our mind, it may take its own shape.  So the reality is I AM EVERYTHING and I AM EVERYWHERE.  Here I is not me. It is just an existance which we call it as GOD with different forms/shapes/structures/personal etc.,

Regards,
SathyaKantha</description>

		<description>Nezz, I see you subscribe to Lynne McTaggart in some way or another. And I do agree that only the collection of masses together can make things happen, but those things are really big scale things. Most everything else could most reasonably be accomplised by yourself.

But then again, who really knows?</description>

		<description>I think that God is not involved personally in our lives. It explains and makes sense with a lot of things in this world. I don't even think evil tugs on us quite as much as people think. I think most, if not all Good and Evil, is a product of people just being people. 

Now having said that, I believe we have a God given ability to solve our own problems through prayer or meditation. The power of thought. Which makes sense to me, because if you have millions and millions of people everyday asking you for help, heal this, heal that, fix this, fix that, would you micro manage every single person... Or... Would you just give them the tool to fix things on their own.

A powerful, God given ability to affect the world around you. So powerful it could make just about anything happen. But that catch is, you cant harness it all on your own. Only the collection of the masses together can make it happen. That is something I have been thinking about and starting to find it possible lately.</description>

		<description>Although I agree with what Solthilde is saying, It's good to see you are satisfied with wolfram. Nothing left to do but have a good time eh? :D</description>

		<description>So hello everyone, its been a long time....something like 5 years since i traversed the psipog site...so i did some looking and landed here. Now unfortunately my extended absence hasnt allowed me to keep up with everything going on, and i have yet to read Wolfram's theory, but i have to ask..(please keep in mind that im not sure what all was discussed in the theory nor do i know your full thoughts on the subject) if one imagines God as exactly that....a God...then wouldnt one attribute all powerfulness to him (him being a simple term to which i can refer back to...idk if God is male) and going along the all powerful line of thought....wouldnt it be possible for him to be infinately huge and infinately small all at the same time? so wouldnt he be able to have a very personal relationship with someone? 

this is mostly me throwing some thoughts out and trying to gauge the collective thoughts and feelings on this topic so please fire back with your thoughts :) always fun to learn what others think</description>

		<description>Sean, a really really important thing to realise is this:

Wolfram didn't figure reality out. He figured out the logical consequences of assuming deterministic materialism.


He tought hard about how you could make sense of reality like he chooses to imagine it and came up with some ingenious solutions. So what he figured out is not how things must or can be, he figured out how things must or can be given that reality is a certain way.

The more interesting question is what reality is. It both precedes all these other questions and determines their content or value.</description>

		<description>I already stated my argument against determinism in the first post on Wolfram's point of view, so I won't restate that here. (http://alittleweird.com/2009/10/03/solution-to-determinismfree-will/#comments)

I'm curious...if you ascribe to a fully stochastic universe (determinism is an incorrect term because of Bell's Inequalities, for one thing), where free will is nonetheless nonexistent, how are phenomena such as telepathy and telekinesis possible?</description>

		<description>The link to Wolfram is broken. 

Other than that, pretty interesting.
Although, when you say it's a matter of time, what timeframe are you talking? :p</description>
