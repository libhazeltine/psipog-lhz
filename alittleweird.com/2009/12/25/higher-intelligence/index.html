				<p>I find it interesting that there seems to be this conflict between science and religion.  There are times when modern scientific belief seems to spit in the face of spirituality, but really, I derive a lot of spiritual feelings from understanding science.</p>
<p>One thing that continues to amaze me is evolution.  The classical argument is always between evolution vs. intelligent design - i.e., did nature randomly produce living creatures, or did some higher intelligence design living creatures?</p>
<p>If you believe in evolution, it usually implies you are denying the existence of some form of higher intelligence.  If evolution is true, then God didn&#8217;t create everything&#8230; natural processes that don&#8217;t rely on God&#8217;s existence did.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really interesting though is that - if you believe in evolution - it becomes highly probable that higher intelligences <em>do</em> exist.</p>
<p>Evolution is something that happens inside of systems.  If a system is flexible enough to have self-replicating objects, then life will eventually evolve.  This &#8220;system&#8221; can be the reality that we live in&#8230; or it can be numbers in a computer.  The system itself doesn&#8217;t matter - just whether the system has enough flexibility to support the process of evolution.</p>
<p>The physical world we live in, on Earth, is flexible enough to support the process of evolution.  Self-replicating objects, starting at the molecular level, slowly evolved over millions of years into multi-cellular organisms.</p>
<p>How far-fetched is it to believe that there are other systems in our reality that are flexible enough to support evolution?  I would argue that it&#8217;s not only possible - it strikes me as quite probable.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps the laws of electro-magnetism have enough flexibility to support evolution.  If they do, then non-physical beings of light could exist right now, having evolved for the past 13 billion years.  That destroys humanity&#8217;s 6 million years of evolution.</p>
<p>It does sound silly to say &#8220;non-physical beings of light&#8221;, but that&#8217;s exactly what it would be.  And if the laws of electro-magnetism are flexible enough to support evolution, then these non-physical, highly-evolved light organisms most certainly exist.</p>
<p>How can you justify being an Atheist, other than you&#8217;re just pissed off at your dad?</p>

			<p>In my opinion, Evolution is managed by higher intelligence.  As you discussed in the previous blog (i.e. Determination V/s Free Will), the evolution in the living beings are determined and controled by higher intelligence.  People think it as external force and gives name of GOD.  But the same kind of evolution is happening with us by our Free Will.  That means we are the part or same as of higher intelligence.  Now the question is what and who is this higher intelligence?  OR how do we recognize this intelligence within us?  I feel the existance of the self(not body or soul) is itself the HIGHER INTELLIGENCE.</p>

			<p>I once watched a show on the Discovery Channel several years ago talking about the evolution of the universe. Someone in this show theorized that life could arise in a large close cluster of stars from electrical/plasma/whatever interactions&#8230; Why not?</p>

			<p>&#8220;How can you justify being an Atheist, other than you’re just pissed off at your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>I justify based on logos arguments, such as &#8220;rock to heavy to lift&#8221; argument against omnipotence, or the absolute future vs ability to change future argument dismissing either omnipotence or omniscience, or the problem of evil against benevolence or omnipotence. My atheism is not at all related to my emotions or my ethics, but my logic.</p>
<p>If you are simply calling something a &#8220;higher intellience&#8221; if it is more complex than humans, then I must return: What has this to do with my atheism? Is this enough to make them gods in your eyes?</p>
<p>You say that evolution is evidence of a higher intelligence because of how flexible the systems present are. What you fail to consider is that if said systems were not as flexible as they are, you wouldn&#8217;t be reading this post, making the fact that you are a moot point. </p>
<p>Simply put, the odds of humans evolving at all are just one possibility out of a near infinite amount, and that fact that this outcome occurred is not noteworthy, because if you rolled an infinite sided die, the odds of of it landing on any given side are nearly zero, but the odds of it landing on ANY side are one.</p>

			<p>Yes, but &#8216;atheism&#8217; most often refers to a belief that there is no higher being.  Or maybe that&#8217;s just because I grew up in a Christian household and have preconceived notions.</p>
<p>But if the die has an infinite amount of sides, and one of those sides states that life is random and biology is not steeped in some type of intelligent design, then aren&#8217;t atheists the ones who are making an impossible assumption?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re making assumptions in your sentence &#8216;Is this enough to make them gods in your eyes&#8217;.  Sean didn&#8217;t argue the existence of a traditional God, only that there is an observable likelihood that evolution is less random and more governed by rules.  Who wrote the rules?  If the answer is &#8220;they&#8217;re just the rules&#8221;, then you&#8217;re operating on just as much faith as a devout Christian, just in the other direction.</p>

			<p>Atheism means a lack of belief in a deity of some sort. Any other belief is up to the individual and may or may not be related to their lack of religion. A &#8220;higher&#8221; power has many definitions, so it really depends on how you define it. Atheism may or may not apply.</p>
<p>Atheists aren&#8217;t making as large of an assumption as those who believe in intelligent design because those who believe in intelligent design make the assumption that there is a higher power and that it did influence how humans came into being. Atheists do not make the assumption that there is a &#8220;higher&#8221; power (since atheism doesn&#8217;t have to be the active disbelief in a deity, mearly the lack of belief in one).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only rolling one die, for the existence of myself. You&#8217;re rolling two, for the existence of a creator, and the existence of yourself. (since the creator did not have to create you, or the human race at all.)</p>
<p>I made no assumption about Sean&#8217;s beliefs; I asked a very specific question. Traditional or otherwise, does a being more &#8220;complicated&#8221; than humans fit his definition of a deity?</p>
<p>And the &#8220;observable likelyhood&#8221; that he argued is &#8220;if the laws of electro-magnetism are flexible enough to support evolution, then these non-physical, highly-evolved light organisms most certainly exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is argument from probability, a logical fallacy. Not only that, but he compared massless particles (photons) to organic molecules. He also failed to define &#8220;flexibility&#8221; in a system.</p>
<p>As for the rules, there are no rules. There are limits that set boundaries, but there are no rules. I don&#8217;t know why these are the limits, perhaps we will find out in the future, but I&#8217;m not going to operate on faith and say that they are completely arbitrary. Most likely, it is a property of space itself that limits movement to this speed, but I can&#8217;t say with any conviction that this is the case seeing as I have not preformed the experiments or done the math.</p>
<p>My &#8220;impossible assumption&#8221; has been observed in a labratory. As for these &#8220;non-physical, highly-evolved light organisms&#8221;, when photons evolve, let me know. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll maintain that my skepticism in the form of atheism until strong, irrefutible evidence should arise to believe in a deity.</p>
