		<description>When you are in this state, try having a computer or pen and paper in front of you. Or perhaps the best way is to record yourself in this state. There might be something that takes your body. I saw a documentary about a man in Sweden (I am too from Sweden(For the record: Sweden is the land between Norway and Finland)) that claimed he, when he made it so, became "possessed" by a spirit from another dimension. This may sound a bit stupid but it was really interesting and very... I dont know, it felt real. It wasnt this cheesy "Haunted Houses"-thing, it was different. That man had the same sensation you describe; No sense of time at all. So please try it out and contact me if something interesting happend.

		<description>IMHO being unaware of something doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

Example: Melissa was born permanently deaf, she is unaware of the existence of sounds. However, she learns in Kindergarten that sounds do in fact exist even though she cannot hear them.

The only way you could understand what it would be like if something or someone did not exist is to imagine what the world would be like without him/her/it. Melissa would have no problems learning if sounds did not exist.

You would have to have never been born in order for the world to know what it is like for you to not exist. Even then there is still a problem, YOU DO EXIST. (for emphasis purposes I put caps, and would like to add that I am not yelling or angry at you)

You are connected with everyone and everything in the universe, and the same goes to everyone and everything else in the universe. You reading this post is affecting other people's lives even if it is the smallest, most insignificant thing. Some may call it Chaos Theory, I call it family because in some small way all of us are connected.

Just some thoughts

		<description>I've never experienced something as intense as that, but I do have days where I feel like a rock being skipped over water, just touching down for so long, then coming back, and so on and so forth.</description>

		<description>I'm not sure if i experience the same kind of "timelessness" that you do, Sean, but I experience a similar state that I'm trying to avoid... I feel like I drifted off but I can't remember thinking about anything, it's like time was just sapped from my existence and I have no recollection of what happened... but there is always some part of you that is present during the "nonexistence," at least in my experience. There is still some kind of ego connection between that state and my normal trance state.

I agree with those who say that the ego will eventually resurface, although I believe in it due to the many worlds hypothesis and offshoots of it rather than just waiting for entropy to spontaneously reverse.</description>

		<description>I'm going to go ahead and add a whole new dimension to this.

The thing is, the non-existence spent in the trance state is only a perception of the conscious mind after the trance state. You know how there are different sides of the brain that have different functions? The conscious is the rationalized and structural side (present most when awake of course.) If during the trance, things are so timeless and strange, the  conscious mind may have a difficult time interpretting that and just sees it as blankness. It's like having a dream that you can't fully remember! That memory is in your mind, and you often know that you spent a long time in a dream. But your conscious may only retain fragments or even nothing of it.

Or let's also just say your right, and during the trance you experienced non-existence. If someone was to measure your brainwaves, they would still be functioning just in a very low delta-wave state. They only fully stop when you are dead. I'm just saying...death is still a mystery.</description>

		<description>I've had this timeless experience trying to have an OBE as well, though I've never actually managed to have one. That said, I've found this experience to be very relaxing in hindsight, though quite jarring upon first coming out of it.

Honestly though, I think there's a lot to look at here. First, you have to consider that OBE's happen. Now, it's possible that people actually leave their body, or it's possible that they hallucinate, and for the ones who provide accurate descriptions of events or strange environments, have some kind of psychic perception. If this is the case, then it's more likely we can say this life is it.

If OBE's happen as advertised though, I'd say that makes a stronger case for an afterlife. After all, you have a conscious soul/spirit/awareness wandering through the ether with no body if that's the case. In which case, it's the timeless feeling with no awareness that's a product of our mind.

My slant is that I do believe in an afterlife, but obviously I don't know any better than anyone else still living.</description>

		<description>True. I think this blog is one-sided. I guess I am only seeing the completely-serious-student-searching-for-truth side of Sean. :-P</description>

		<description>@bobelly - Why is it one or the other?  I enjoy life, and I search for truth.  Will I "finish" in this lifetime?  I don't know if it's possible to finish.  I don't have anything else going on, so I might as well do my best :-).</description>

		<description>Sean do you genuinely believe you can find the "truth" in this lifetime? How about you just enjoy life as it is? :P</description>
