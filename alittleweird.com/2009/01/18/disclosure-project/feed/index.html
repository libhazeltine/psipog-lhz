		<description>Maybe I'll watch it later.  I'm busy downloading stuff right now.

Still, interesting thoughts, Sean.  You can't prove for, you can't prove against.  While I personally am for with slight skepticism against some of the more "far-out" stories, I say it's good to take the Devil's Advocate role, should the conversation ever arise.</description>

		<description>Hmm..Interesting. When I have some extra free time on my hands, I will definitely  check it out.

The problem with gathering evidence for this sort of thing is that even if someone had an abundance of pictures and videos documenting the strange phenomenon they are experiencing, there will always be someone there to disprove it. Whether or not the evidence in question is fake, it will be "proven" as fake. 

The edge is too blurry, that corner of the picture is too dark, the shadows are out of alignment. 

It's an interesting dilemma. Evidence is demanded, and when it is provided, it is instantly discredited. 

Even things that have been proven are still shunned by society. It doesn't MATTER that we have EMPs and EVPs and infrareds that can pick up things that can't be seen with the human eye. And it doesn't matter that there are countless personal experiences. After all, those people are just crazy, right? 

What I'm talking about obviously is the paranormal. Something can be proven to exist, and still people refuse to believe it.

So does that bring it down to the insecurities of society?

Or I could call governmental conspiracy on the whole UFO thing. Just a huge coverup. Haha.

Well..I'm done ranting for a moment. Sorry for boring anyone who might have read that.</description>
