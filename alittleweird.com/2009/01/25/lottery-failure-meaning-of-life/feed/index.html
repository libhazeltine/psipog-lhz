		<description>Must everything have meaning? Whats the meaning of the little toe? Why do we have it? Should it consume my every thought and feeling wondering why I possess a little toe? Somethings are currently beyond our understanding but that doesn't mean that the knowledge is unattainable. Teaching a child quantum physics can be frustrating but as he grows he will slowly begin to understand. Seek an answer and you will find it.</description>

		<description>Hey, just to help you out....I've written to you some time ago about OBE's....what i see now is you look for the meaning of life, which is, actually, human nature: curiosity...definition of curiosity: a state in which you want to learn more about something. one of the many human mistakes is to be so curious...because of curiosity we practice things we should not practice, we do things we should not. lottery was a bad choice to prove your point. the balls aren't alive, th chances are too big...you have a small chance of winning, but so does half of the world.

don't look for the meaning of life..look forward to be more of a complete person. most of us will never get to know the meaning of life, we will never learn why, but why spend so much time trying to find something forbidden to human eyes? my advice: learn from everything around you, 'cause everything teaches a lesson and every lesson is a step towards peace. everything you do has an impact on you. try to analyze these simple things that happen to you, take choices based on everything you learn. if you make a bad choice, there is still time to fix it, just don't get stranded on the Lost Woods, if you know what i mean.

you're asking the wrong question. think.</description>

		<description>About the lottery, I was wondering, maybe you fail because a million other people wishing something different, (that THEY will win the lottery,) maybe it becomes some kind of mental fight.
The one with the strongest will + best concentration wins :P

		<description>Pretty sure the goal was to win the lottery jackpot.

I just meant that he throws so much extra thought into everything. Even in this post, he started off talking about the lottery and ended up talking about the meaning of life and how we'll never really know.

He wants to win the jackpot, there's no reason for all this over-analyzing. It only adds to his doubt and confusion.

Now, I'm not saying to not analyze things. It just that it should be done separately. It shouldn't interfere with your lottery practice.</description>

		<description>ness, I don't think the point was to win the lottery... the point was to figure out stuff and the lottery was just the means to that end.</description>

		<description>You put way too much thought into everything. To win the lottery, practice precognition and working with your subconscious. Winning money doesn't have to involve the meaning of life, your true identity and all that crap.

It's like when people associate religion with Psionics. There is no real connection, only the connections you decide to MAKE.

Break those connections and simplify your training. You throw a lot of useless philosophy into this lottery thing. Save it for another time. Your lottery practice time should be just that.</description>

		<description>You haven't lost yet, you just are currently losing.

Humans are the ones who would shout "I" on the top of the world. We are all obsessed with cosmically irrelevant notions of individuality and the pursuit of our own Truth.
The thing about Truth is that it isn't always true. ;)</description>

		<description>I like where your recent posts have gone, Sean. I have a gut feeling that we're trapped by this human-created idea that life has meaning. It's prevalent throughout the world and it probably started to deal with strife and hard times. If there's a larger scheme than you, then your struggles are for "something" rather than "nothing." Maybe it started as a protective measure so people wouldn't kill themselves off with their new-found existentialism (whenever we evolved such thinking capacities), but today I think it's merely limiting our ideas, ways of thinking, and evolution.

It's interesting though, how did we develop these existential ideas, if they're based on a completely false premise?

I feel like there has to be something very liberating about grasping the "dust to dust" mentality, but in my current self-absorbed state (socially induced of course), I'm still trying to find meaning in the idea that "life has no meaning." Of course, as you write, the answer is "Mu," the question is false, but where does that leave us?...

On some level, this is exactly the type of "enlightenment" stressed by eastern thought for a long while now. So again, where does this truth leave us in our modern world, a world created on false meaning?</description>
