		<description>"My obsession for truth originates in my strong sense of survival.  I don’t pursue truth for some higher purpose - I pursue it because my biology wants to survive, and my programming is betting that this abstract concept of “truth” will give me an evolutionary advantage."

How the hell did you get that in your head? Please snap out of this bullshit. Interpret the things according to what they are, not according to what some arguable theory about reality says they should be.

"See, now the real questions start.  The real hard ones.  Such as, How does one live a fulfilling life?  What matters?"

No, you are already past the real questions, and you have already answered them in a certain (arguable) way. The questions mentioned here are a consequence of these answers.</description>

		<description>You are true Sean. Your "search for truth" is a noble venture.  The knowledge and experience you are sharing will help 1000+ people around the globe. Wish you continue the same for long period. 

But the fullfilling of life will happen if we can bring smile(make happy) on somebody's face using our skill.  Like Mother Theresa, who served the needy poeple with the skill she had.  In my feeling SERVICE to the needy is something that matters in this universe.

Let me know if I need to be corrected somewhere.
