		<description>Hi Sean,

I am interested to join the team to practically work on telepathic skills.  I am ready to research and develop the subject.  Let me have your suggestions on this.  You can reach me on sat_bt124@yahoo.co.in.</description>

		<description>i'm interested in seeing how this plays out and what kind of manner you would use to publish your findings, assuming that you do gather enough evidence to "prove" a particular skill or discipline as scientific fact.

i don't think i'm good enough at anything to be of much use, but if i come across anything that i could contribute, i'll know where to send it to ;)

also: it's NI again! that answers my rhetorical question on one of the forum topics &#62;_&#62;;;</description>

		<description>I've been very much involved in different communities earlier under another nickname, but now I think it's time to start over again as a lot of things have changed, and I think it's time to move and start thinking about the future and the now.

I'm still very much into practicing and studying psychic abilities, and me and my apprentice keep pushing ourselves forward in improving our skills and discovering new applications for them. 

I very much like this idea, and I have in fact for a long time thought of starting something similar to this. I might instead join this project, and do my best on contributing and help everyone move forward in their understanding and ability of various paranormal phenomena. 

But first I'd like to know more about what your purpose will be for this. I'm personally very much interested in expanding on my own understanding, and also an opportunity of increasing my own and others' skills through the sharing of experiences and demonstrations of abilities. I'm not interested in proving myself to the world, if that's the purpose of this.

		<description>Holy cow look at all the heavy hitters we have here!

Looks like you may be on to something Sean :D

Like NI, my PK is not what it once was but this thread (and maybe a few viewings of Good Will Hunting :P) has got me motivated again.
When I get back to a "proof supplying level" I'll send you an e-mail.

Cheers,

		<description>I think it's a good idea and would like to help if I can.  I am not sure how I could help but I will if you want me to.</description>

		<description>Hey look... it's NI... (Probably doesn't know me)

Anyways, after a bit of thinking, I decided that I wouldn't want to be a leader, but I'll gladly help anyone who needs it.  I tend to be somewhat good with complex constructs and most other stuff except OBEs, lucid dreaming, and the like.</description>

		<description>Same old, same old, my friend  :-)
Life's been challenging, but the course is clear and the fortitude in our hearts will not vanish!

Are you still in control of your TK, Sean? I've lost a lot. Thinking about starting a small daily-practice-routine again :-P</description>

		<description>There is a difference between proving the existence of psi to myself, and proving/discovering the behavior of psi for everyone's benefit.  By forcing myself (and others) to be accountable to each other, we can start to tackle some hard questions.  Sure, it's great that I believe that OBEs are proof of life after death... but I don't have the evidence to back that up.  If I stay in my own world, I can avoid challenging myself to find that evidence.  But if I set a goal to prove it to someone else - and also remain open to the possibility that I could be wrong - then I'll need to genuinely challenge myself, and gather real, compelling evidence.

In the long run, that means we all have more answers... not based on opinion or what we "think" makes sense - but based on what reality tells us.

What's up NI? :-)</description>

		<description>Sean, I have a question about the 'Proof' you're looking for. What 'kind of' proof are you looking for? The scientific 'we-can-explain-how-Psi-works-now-proof', the 'we-have-shown-that-Psi-exists-proof' or maybe some other kind of proof? What are you looking for exactly?

		<description>Yes, I am curious as well as to what your intentions were :D I thought you have found the proof you were seeking. Sounds like an interesting project, unfortunalty i am very busy as of now... Maybe by june things will ease up. I have an interest in perceptive abilities. I think Remote Viewing would be a good start for me.

I will have to see how things go with schooling.
