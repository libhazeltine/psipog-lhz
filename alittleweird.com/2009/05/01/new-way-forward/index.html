				<p>The time has come&#8230;</p>
<p>ALW has served as an open meditation for me.  It has allowed me to express bizarre theories, test them against reality, share interesting information, and preach a little bit too.  It has been a nice corner for myself and a solid group of members to talk about weird stuff.  The members have shown patience in entertaining my thoughts, and expressed themselves honestly, whether to show agreement, or challenge my ideas on their merit alone, without special treatment.  For that, I am profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>But we know where this is going&#8230; it&#8217;s time for an upgrade in collective purpose.</p>
<p>I hereby announce my intention to organize and create a coalition of passionate individuals, focused on one primary goal:</p>
<p>Proof.</p>
<p>What does &#8220;proof&#8221; mean?  It means intelligent research into paranormal phenomenon, focused on collection of evidence (whether that evidence is in support of the phenomenon, or not).  If possible, this also means providing demonstrations (online, or in person), and/or instructions for reproducible experiments.</p>
<p>I am seeking volunteers willing to join me in leading this effort.  I only want serious, passionate leaders, who have a history of honest, intelligent, and open experimentation with the paranormal.  I also recommend the volunteer has a long history with a particular phenomenon they plan on investigating, in order to give them a good starting point.  I personally will be focusing primarily on out-of-body experiences (but may branch into other skills as well).</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that - while I definitely plan on having fun - this is a seirous venture.  You must be 18+ to volunteer as a leader.  As a leader, you will be held to high expectations.  With that said, I have a full-time job just like everyone else, so I don&#8217;t expect daily updates.  But I do expect progress to be made.</p>
<p>What can I offer volunteers?  1. A platform for posting results.  2. Equipment.  3. Research material.  4. Possibly further funding in the future.  5. A community of like-minded people, passionate about discovering truth.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this effort, feel free to ask in the comments, on the forum, or e-mail me directly (via the &#8220;Contact&#8221; button).  If you would like to volunteer, please contact me with your history, and what areas you would like to investigate.</p>
<p>I plan on creating a new site for this, but would first like to get a list of volunteers to discuss details with.</p>
<p>I ask my friends reading this that, even if you don&#8217;t want to volunteer, but know someone who might, please pass this invitation along to them.  Thank you!  More to come.</p>

			<p>Interesting, it is a good step forward. Unfortunetly, I do not know if I could possbily qualify as a leader given that I would most likely not have enough experience in any one area that you would find useful. But hopefully you get enough volunteers though.</p>

			<p>Hey Sean, I think it&#8217;s great you&#8217;re looking for a group of individuals to join your newest community idea advocated on producing results with paranormal attributes. I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re looking for materialistic results, or is this community also going to be focusing on subjective abilities such as telepathy or empathy? </p>
<p>As for recruitment, my record proceeds me. I&#8217;m not too shabby on producing concrete evidence to support a psionic claim in questioning. Whether that would be a remote viewing target, or a measuring device such as the Geiger counter. So if you need a hand, I&#8217;ll be willing to put worth some time dedicated to contribute evidence in psionics once again. </p>
<p>Let me know if I can be of some help. I&#8217;ll be glad to help you out. Hope you&#8217;re doing well. Shoot me an email, <a href="mailto:JoeT233@Gmail.com">JoeT233@Gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Joe</p>

			<p>Once I started reading this I instantly thought of good old Joe here :P. I remember a while ago I was talking to Joe about doing something very similar to this, but due to conflicting schedules filled with girlfriends, jobs, and school, it never got off the drawing board. </p>
<p>If you are willing to put in the work and deal with the headaches I&#8217;d be more than glad to offer any help in the matter. I have held firm to my lack of interest in scientific &#8220;proof&#8221; for awhile, but I guess that completely depends on the purpose behind it it. The overall goal. I suppose I do have some questions but I&#8217;ll just wait for more information prior to blurting any questions tonight. You know how to find me and I&#8217;ll definitley be around :). This is rather exciting.</p>

			<p>As you know I&#8217;ve never been one to offer up proofs since I prefer people to find them on their own; however there are a number of courses that we&#8217;ll be running over the next year that will provide great amounts of information to a cause such as this.  Get in contact with me and we&#8217;ll hammer out the details.</p>

			<p>Do you guys have any kind of source for occult information?</p>
<p>I feel like there is some serious stuff out there, which should be handled with care..</p>
<p>I used to play with the ouija board when I was a kid, but I found it to be overwhelming at times, and I stopped using it..</p>
<p>and recently, I was psychically attacked.. and it was horrible.. all im saying is be safe..</p>
<p>that, and i could use some online resources for paranormal study..</p>
<p>also, what kind of proof are you willing to accept?</p>
<p>ps.. have you heard of ning? its an online community platform that is free and very easy to use.</p>

			<p>i would LIKE to contribute, i really would. (mainly in the areas of perceptive and effective stuff regarding the physical world, mainly perceptive.)</p>
<p>but with uni the way it is, and my timezone, i would only be able to do stuff for 6 months of the year (3 months at a time, give or take, over summer and winter).</p>

			<p>Same here as Raathuus. I&#8217;m still a bloody beginner with psionic abilities, but I have read a lot already (not as much as most most of you for sure). I also haven&#8217;t had much experiences with the paranormal, but I think I could provide good ideas and sooner or later I will also be able to help to more extent when my skills (and hopefully my experiences) reach a higher level.</p>

			<p>I´ve been following this website for quite a while now, but never registered. Until I read this entry.. =P</p>
<p>I see you&#8217;re creating a research team that focuses on scientific proof. I&#8217;ve been practising PK for quite a while now, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m qualified to be a leader. But maybe in a few years I will.. You see, I&#8217;m a Chemistry student (1st year) at the Leiden University (Netherlands) and from next year on I will also be studying Psychology. I have always been interested in Chemistry and Psychology, and I believe that these two areas combined hold the secret to Psychokinesis. This because PK takes place when there is an interaction between the mind and matter. Chemistry studies matter and Psychology studies the mind. </p>
<p>So.. I think I don&#8217;t have enough experience to be a leader, but maybe I can help the experienced people with some ideas.</p>

			<p>Sean, my friend, I thought you were beyond the point of &#8220;Proof&#8221; when you put a lock on PsiPog <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
Is it about proving this stuff to &#8220;others&#8221; now?</p>

			<p>Yes, I am curious as well as to what your intentions were <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> I thought you have found the proof you were seeking. Sounds like an interesting project, unfortunalty i am very busy as of now&#8230; Maybe by june things will ease up. I have an interest in perceptive abilities. I think Remote Viewing would be a good start for me.</p>
<p>I will have to see how things go with schooling.</p>

			<p>Sean, I have a question about the &#8216;Proof&#8217; you&#8217;re looking for. What &#8216;kind of&#8217; proof are you looking for? The scientific &#8216;we-can-explain-how-Psi-works-now-proof&#8217;, the &#8216;we-have-shown-that-Psi-exists-proof&#8217; or maybe some other kind of proof? What are you looking for exactly?</p>

			<p>There is a difference between proving the existence of psi to myself, and proving/discovering the behavior of psi for everyone&#8217;s benefit.  By forcing myself (and others) to be accountable to each other, we can start to tackle some hard questions.  Sure, it&#8217;s great that I believe that OBEs are proof of life after death&#8230; but I don&#8217;t have the evidence to back that up.  If I stay in my own world, I can avoid challenging myself to find that evidence.  But if I set a goal to prove it to someone else - and also remain open to the possibility that I could be wrong - then I&#8217;ll need to genuinely challenge myself, and gather real, compelling evidence.</p>
<p>In the long run, that means we all have more answers&#8230; not based on opinion or what we &#8220;think&#8221; makes sense - but based on what reality tells us.</p>

			<p>Hey look&#8230; it&#8217;s NI&#8230; (Probably doesn&#8217;t know me)</p>
<p>Anyways, after a bit of thinking, I decided that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be a leader, but I&#8217;ll gladly help anyone who needs it.  I tend to be somewhat good with complex constructs and most other stuff except OBEs, lucid dreaming, and the like.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been very much involved in different communities earlier under another nickname, but now I think it&#8217;s time to start over again as a lot of things have changed, and I think it&#8217;s time to move and start thinking about the future and the now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still very much into practicing and studying psychic abilities, and me and my apprentice keep pushing ourselves forward in improving our skills and discovering new applications for them. </p>
<p>I very much like this idea, and I have in fact for a long time thought of starting something similar to this. I might instead join this project, and do my best on contributing and help everyone move forward in their understanding and ability of various paranormal phenomena. </p>
<p>But first I&#8217;d like to know more about what your purpose will be for this. I&#8217;m personally very much interested in expanding on my own understanding, and also an opportunity of increasing my own and others&#8217; skills through the sharing of experiences and demonstrations of abilities. I&#8217;m not interested in proving myself to the world, if that&#8217;s the purpose of this.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;m good enough at anything to be of much use, but if i come across anything that i could contribute, i&#8217;ll know where to send it to <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
