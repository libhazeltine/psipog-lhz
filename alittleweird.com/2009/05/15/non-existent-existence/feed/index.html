		<description>I am enjoying this convo as well..

In my head, I conceptualized traveling 0.9 as almost moving foward, but rather moving backward..

I will continue the discussion @ fundamental infinity.</description>

		<description>Sorry, it looks like I was wrong about the expansion of the universe... I've google'd it, and it's a common misconception that it's expanding at the speed of light.  The correct answer is explained nicely here:

http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071002065002AAEoO37

Here's a good answer as to why you can't travel at the speed of light:

http://physics.suite101.com/article.cfm/traveling_at_the_speed_of_light

.999 with a line over top is actually equal to 1:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...

Even so, if you're moving .9 (without line) km/hr, you are still moving.  It would take you about 4 seconds to move a meter:

http://www37.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=.9+km%2Fhr

I think infinity and emergence is an interesting discussion, but I also think a lot of your concepts are based on flawed math/science.</description>

		<description>The universe is expanding into itself? Nice one..

Like, what does this even mean? (that the universe is on the other side of the universe???)

I think this is some way of getting around the issue.. new galaxies would tell me that the so called "big bang" is occuring all the time, out into forever.. science is just too crabby to admit that forever exists.

Lets take some calculations, and translate them into concepts, shall we? (I believe that psycology means as much to numbers as numbers do to anything else.. yeah.) Lets take a non ending equation like 0.999 with a line overtop and put that in perspective with distance from point A to point B.. If you were traveling .999 (line overtop) kilometers an hour, would you be going anywhere? Youd never get there, so it would be pointless to try. But this is where it gets weird. I think that patterns emerge out of this infinity.. the pointless game of wasting time in infinity.

		<description>I have heard that the universe is speeding up.. care to explain this? 'Cause there's nothing faster than the speed of light, right?

The chaos theory is the plague of modern science..

It takes us further away from a unified field theory where science and nature are balanced.

Infinite energy to travel the speed of light?

Are you thinking fossil fuels? Yet another plague of modern 'science'..

I believe that if you were frictionless (in space) you could use a giant reflector to help hitch hike off of the suns photons, propelling you to light speed requiring no amount of energy.</description>

		<description>According to modern science, space is definitely NOT infinite.  It is expanding at the speed of light.  This is where the theory of the big bang comes from - science measures how big the universe is, how fast it's expanding, and then does the math in reverse to get the age of the universe.

So you can't go "outside" of the universe, because that would mean you are traveling faster than the speed of light, which would require an infinite amount of energy (because you have mass).

@AngelsFall: Humans didn't create math.  Math is a system that exists outside of the human mind, that humans have discovered.  This sounds a bit weird, but it's true.  This is why math is called the "universal language", because any intelligent animal can discover math just like we did.</description>

		<description>i'm not saying space isn't infinite [though that is arguable], i'm just saying you're using the word "mass" inappropriately here xP

the Mandelbrot and Julia sets are fascinating, but i'm not a math person, so i'll leave that alone for now xP</description>

		<description>Ok.. "space is not infinite mass"

Then what do you suppose is outside the universe?

I asked myself if infinity could exist a long time ago.. and I found an infinity that did exist!!

Microphone feedback!

The mathematical equation for this phenomenon is a 'recurrence relation' sequence, just like the Fibonacci numbers. How interesting.. out of this formula, we see a balanced system of growth throughout nature.. (phi ratio) and from it, we can produce the Mandelbrot set, which gives us a glimpse at nasty infinity which we call 'fractals'.

This is not too off topic if you use your creativity.. we are discussing existence, after all..</description>

		<description>that doesn't make any sense, i just typed this whole long argument to Sean's post and little 4-line mess up there is all that posted...

lemme try this again. forgive me if this ends up being a fragment because i'm not gonna clutter this blog with a triple-post if this doesn't work &#62;_&#62;


@Sean: personally i don't believe the mathematical concept exists outside of the human mind, which created the math. the objects that there is a ratio between exist, but we are the only ones who can attach the extra "4:3" or whatever to it.
there may be a mathematical model for consciousness, but the math itself isn't the consciousness, just as you can paint an intricate painting of a tree yet it is not the tree [problems with converting 3D to 2D aside].

i dunno if consciousness is an emergent property of our brains, so i won't touch that part of your post.

anyway:
a concept doesn't still exist if the universe implodes because a human mind created the concept. in a randomized Rubik's cube, there is a shortest/fastest route to solving the cube, which is mathematically sound and well-tested... but this is a concept humans have created. 

"Perhaps you are only 15 spins away from the solution.  The problem is that you don’t know what those 15 spins are.  The point is that those 15 spins exist."

there is a concept that humans have created that deals with the fastest method to get the unorganized Rubik's Cube into the "solved" state. in our minds, the concept exists. as a related concept, we recognize that if we make a certain sequence of 15 spins, we will "solve" the cube. the 15 steps themselves don't exist outside of our minds, they are possible actions that we could take that we are turning over in our heads.

in conclusion: my argument is that i don't think the emergent properties exist if they aren't conscious. consciousness may be an emergent property, and certain mathematical properties may be as well, but i don't think they're conscious.

all pure-blooded Chinese men are Asian, but not all pure-blooded Asian men are Chinese.

or at least, that's my interpretation =D
