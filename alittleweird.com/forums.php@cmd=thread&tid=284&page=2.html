<br />
Any how, I have had a couple of experiences. Now, my bedroom is connected to a hallway that leads out into the kitchen area, well I had woken up one night and was goning to get a drink from the kitchen sink, well as I round the corner into the kitchen I thought I saw what looked to be a black shadow of a human figure leaning on a counter that was directly across from where you come out of the hallway, as far as I could tell it was facing towards me, but I only saw it for a second before it was gone.<br />
<br />
And then another time I was trying to sleep out on the couch in the living room, now, I had a clear view of the kitchen table, and I could see something black moving in a circle around the table leg, since the table does not have individual legs per se, but more like one large main leg with four feet coming from it. At first I thought it was my cat, so I asked my mother if the cat was in her bedroom, because the cat ends up sleeping with her most of the time, and she said the cat was in bed with her. Needless to say I kind of freaked out about that. Years later...I was talking to someone about my experiences, and he had said that I had most likely experienced a phenomenon called &#039;Clear Vision&#039;, in which things that we normally do not see but are all around us can be observed, even if only for a split second or a out of the corner of the eye type of thing. He also said that the thing roaming around the table was a non-human entity, such as maybe some kind of animal spirit, since it was not very large or high off of the ground which is why I mistook it for my cat.</div>

X-Master-The geography of the area around her house...Well, I know that the house that they lived in, my grandfather built when they had got married. So it was an old house, but not really old. I would guess that the woods behind her house used to span over a huge area of land, including where the house was. But I can&#039;t be entirely sure, because to get to the woods you had to scale down this huge dropoff...Other than that. The land was basically flat with a few hills here and there.

<br />
1. You were 5 years old. Not saying you&#039;re stupid or anything, but when I was about that age, I vididly remember a full-size airplane flying overhead when I was in the family van with my relatives, and the plane was just feet above the car, but no one took notice. But this wasn&#039;t just a foggy memory, I can very clearly and vividly remember this happening, but of course, there&#039;s no way this was true.<br />
<br />
2. You just woke up. It goes without saying, we&#039;ve all thought/done very stupid things just minutes after we&#039;ve woken up, whether it be mistaking the time 7:00 am for 6:00 am and being late for something, or not realizing that you&#039;re not dreaming anymore. Waking up after having a scary dream and then having the lights go out (which would probably mess your vision up pretty bad) could probably make you see something pretty odd. Them disappearing could have just been your night vision kicking back in or w/e.<br />
<br />
You said you haven&#039;t seen a spirit sense then, so that&#039;s something else that supports this theory.</div>

2. You just woke up. It goes without saying, we&#039;ve all thought/done very stupid things just minutes after we&#039;ve woken up, whether it be mistaking the time 7:00 am for 6:00 am and being late for something, or not realizing that you&#039;re not dreaming anymore. Waking up after having a scary dream and then having the lights go out (which would probably mess your vision up pretty bad) could probably make you see something pretty odd. Them disappearing could have just been your night vision kicking back in or w/e.

You said you haven&#039;t seen a spirit sense then, so that&#039;s something else that supports this theory.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_12706" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Well the reason I asked that question about the geography about the area around your grandmother&#039;s house was because that chances are what you saw before was a habitual haunting, not sure what the exact term is right now, but basically that just means that events and other things just play themselves over and over again like a tape recorder, and most of the time it doesn&#039;t realize anything has really changed. The reason for the geography is because sometimes that happens when the area has a lot of minerals in it, espeically quartz, since it stores the energy from those events and then plays them back during periodically. So like Corpse said before there probably was a house there at one time, and some of those energies were recorded and it gets played back every so often.<br />
<br />
A note about sleep paralysis, even though they do not know what causes it, there have been studies done on it. Your body paralyzes you during dream sleep, so you do not act out your dreams and hurt yourself, but sometimes it can go haywire, such as during sleep walking, or in sleep paralysis werein you wake up during dream sleep and you are still paralyzed, so chances are you would see something, such as in the myths about something being on peoples chests.<br />
<br />
And also, dream sleep is characterized by theta brain waves, and overall it looks very close to brain activity close to the awake state. And it has been postulated that the theta state in the brain in considerded magic hour, were a lot of psychic or psionic phenomenon occur. Since the during the theta state the conscious and subconscious parts are said to be able to communicate more freely. So that may explain some of what faceless has been experiencing.</div>

		<div id="post_12713" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Corpse-I remember the term now. It&#039;s &quot;Radiesthesia&quot;. It&#039;s divination using a pendulum. I use a very basic set-up when I do it.<br />
<br />
On a piece of paper draw a simple cross. At each end of the vertical line, write &quot;Yes&quot;, and on each end of the horizontal line, write &quot;No&quot;. <br />
<br />
The beauty of this form of divination is that you don&#039;t need any fancy materials, and it&#039;s relatively uncomplicated.<br />
<br />
All you need is a length of chain, and something to weight on the end. You could use a ring or a pendant..You got a necklace like that? Excellent. You&#039;d be in business.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that there is an article about this on psipog.net. But I use a different method-the one outline in &quot;Wicca for One&quot; by Raymond Buckland. (Just in case this comes up, no, I am not a Wiccan. I just enjoy reading all kinds of things like this).<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t agree completely with some of the things in the article. However, this may just be because I read the other information first, and connected with it immediately.  In any case, I question what force it is that makes the pendulum move. Is it what Rainsong said-your subconcious? Or is it something else?<br />
<br />
In any case, it doesn&#039;t matter in this instance. Because I use it to communicate with spirits.<br />
<br />
Where you practice this doesn&#039;t make a difference. The last time I did it, I was in a brightly lit room using a floor table. I was not alone. I used no candles or incense. <br />
<br />
I must throw out there, however, that since you are trying to communicate with an entity, you might want to be in a quiet place. You MIGHT want to be alone. You can&#039;t really guess what circumstances would be most conducive to contact with the spirit you are trying to communicate with. I&#039;d experiment with different things, see what works. If nothing does, it may be quite possible that it doesn&#039;t want to &quot;play&quot; with you.<br />
<br />
Simple set-ups work obviously. But it might be good to move on to a more advanced one. It will expand the kinds of questions you can ask - mainly ones that aren&#039;t just &quot;yes&quot; &quot;no&quot;. There are different ways to set up the most advanced ones. These include letters or numbers and sometimes both. I&#039;d recommend looking it up online, because it would be difficult to explain and best understood if you could see it for yourself in the first place.<br />
<br />
Now, you don&#039;t have to close your eyes for this. You aren&#039;t &quot;drawing&quot; on anything. You&#039;re waiting for it to come to you. Eyes open or closed, you can&#039;t influence that. Unless you can somehow summon spirits O.o Unlikely.<br />
<br />
Many people aren&#039;t sure of the proper way to hold the pendulum. Do you hold your elbow off the table? Or do you rest it on the table? I prefer to rest my elbow on the table, because it steadies your arm. You won&#039;t get any interference from your own body shaking.<br />
<br />
The chain should be wrapped around your forefinger and middle finger. It should hang only a few centimeters above the paper. Let the chain hang down and steady it, so it doesn&#039;t swing. Then ask your question.<br />
<br />
Back and forth swinging indicates &quot;Yes&quot; answers -follows the yes line. Side to side indicates &quot;No&quot; answers. <br />
<br />
The pendulum at times may just swing in a circle. This means either your question cannot be answered, or you phrased it ambiguously. Rephrase and try again.<br />
<br />
Some people may be going-Well, this sounds sketchy! How am I supposed to know that I&#039;ve really contacted a spirit and not something else?<br />
<br />
The answer is in the questions. You can obviously formulate questions that will tell you what you have indeed made contact with. <br />
<br />
Other fun things that you can do with this.<br />
<br />
You might set up a tape recorder. I&#039;d recommend doing this. Not only does it give you a record of what you&#039;ve done, but you can capture things that you couldn&#039;t hear with your own ears. You might get disembodied voices, answers to your questions in the verbal. <br />
<br />
You could also set up a camera. If you&#039;re not sure what type of camera would be best for capturing spirits, look it up. Since regular disposable cameras with no special lenses or anything can capture a spirit, I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t need anything fancy. Something regular would probably do. Just to clarify, I AM talking about a video camera. The latter was just an example.<br />
<br />
However, onto that. If you do this with a friend, you can have them snap photos every so often. Who knows? You might get something on tape.<br />
<br />
<br />
X-Master- I&#039;m not sure there was a house there. The trees were old, you know? Two things that don&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
1) When did showers come about? Since the trees are old, it&#039;s unlikely a house was in that precise spot, but...<br />
2) If there wasn&#039;t a house there, an entity randomly appearing up a tree taking a shower honestly makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
Why did we see it only once if it was a habitual haunting? And why that particular event?<br />
<br />
Questions I will never have answered, since my grandparents have since moved and I have no way to go back and investigate the area. <br />

I hate false awakenings. That has happened to me too many times. It got to the point where when I really did wake up, I didn&#039;t believe it. I went through the day believing I was still asleep and people had to convince me I wasn&#039;t. I was also hella paranoid, &#039;cause I kept expecting some bad shit to go down haha.</div>I hate those too.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I wake up abruptly and open my eyes, everything is black and white for a while, sometimes for up to two or three minutes. Does this happen to anyone else?</div>
