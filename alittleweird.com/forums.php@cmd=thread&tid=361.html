For those of you wondering (and if you&#039;ve seen it before and done your research, you aren&#039;t, but screw you, you don&#039;t matter. = D) that is a real photograph, and what is happening in it is not altered or photoshopped.<br />
<br />
Thich Quang Duc was a Buddhist monk in the Vietnam war era who, in protest of a corrupt government that banned the display of Buddhist flags and worship, and with the aid of his fellow monks(who blocked fire trucks from reaching him by lying in the street), was drenched in gasoline and lit himself on fire in the middle of a public street. He burned to death supposively without even moving a muscle.<br />
<br />
Fire is what makes people scream in bloody agony and dart about wildly as it burns away their flesh. Yet this guy not only didn&#039;t budge an inch, he didn&#039;t even make a sound.<br />
<br />
One famous reporter of the time, David Halberstam reported the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;I was to see that sight again, but once was enough. Flames were coming from a human being; his body was slowly withering and shriveling up, his head blackening and charring. In the air was the smell of burning human flesh; human beings burn surprisingly quickly. Behind me I could hear the sobbing of the Vietnamese who were now gathering. I was too shocked to cry, too confused to take notes or ask questions, too bewildered to even think... As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know about the rest of you, but there is something about that devotion and utmost security in sticking by what he believed in that really invokes inspiration.</div>

My Breathing becomes so minimal it is ussually not visible that I AM acctually breathing, and in that state, I have a very high resistance to pain, and I&#039;m just an average teen. That being Said, Just imagin what he could do.<br />

I think he just shut off his Nervous system, Therefore he would not move, neither would he have aany feeling of pain.<br />
<br />
On another note, When you get burned to a certain extent, you just &quot;stop&quot; feeling the pain. It&#039;s because of damage to your nerves, If you ask any firefighter or burn victem, you&#039;re likely to get this response.<br />
