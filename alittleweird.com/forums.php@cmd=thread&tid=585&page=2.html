Non-psionic rebels? You can see practically anywhere and scan their intentions in order to crush them while they are still a seedling. Psions?

Oh and BTW I am not a douche, I am trying to figure out what is right in this world. No mortal person will stop me from achieving this goal, not you dash, not antisankari, and not even Sean for that matter. I remember from Sean&#039;s 2nd psionics handbook he said that there was no complete right, and I have been thinking maybe it is because we have not found the true right.<br />
<br />
I believe that if I programmed my subconscious to think of what is truly right without any of my biases, it will help me search for this real truth.<br />
<br />
You know people do not believe psionics is real until they experience it (and sometimes then they still do not believe), the same goes to what is truly real.<br />
<br />
When I do I will come back and reply to this article.</div>you just told me to kill myself because my life has no meaning..<br />
so yes.. you are a douche.. a self righteous douche on a quest for so called &#039;truth&#039;<br />
<br />
anything you discover will only be a truth to you..<br />
just like this, no matter what i say.. you&#039;ll only believe the truth hasn&#039;t already been found..  instead of actually listening to what i say your too preoccupied with the idea that no mortal man can learn the &#039;truth&#039; but you..<br />
<br />
don&#039;t take my words as gospel.. and don&#039;t take them as lies.. take them as &#039;ideas&#039;,<br />
and keep them at your fingertips until they prove what they are to you,<br />
thats the real way to find truth..</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;"><em>posted by Psikillion:</em><br />
So since you believe there is no true point to anything in life then you should kill yourself, because there is no meaning in your life.</div>And say this: I absolutely hate when people say that, and yes, I&#039;ve seen other people say it. Let&#039;s take a look at animals. Animals go about their businesses living on instinct, they can not, and do not look for &quot;meanings&quot; like humans. You could say instinct is their meaning in life. So, since we are animals too, and have instincts as well, then you could also say we have a bottom line meaning of life, and that is to survive. So, what I&#039;m really saying is that we humans don&#039;t need petty &quot;meanings in life&quot; because they are basically just useless thoughts. So, you could basically say everyone has an unspoken meaning in life. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s sick to tell someone else to kill themself...  <br />
