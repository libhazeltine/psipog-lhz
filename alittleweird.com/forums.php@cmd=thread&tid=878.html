		<div id="post_15755" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hello. I know I havent been around much..But I have something to say.<br />
<br />
Psionics, in my opinion, is dead. Just gone. This post may offend some people, sorry. <br />
<br />
The psionic community used to be packed. Everybody was a happy, practicing psion, there was always somewhere you could go to learn, people were willing to learn, people would practice, and the community was not dead. I&#039;m talking back between 2000 - 2006. PsiPog, UPC, PsiOnline, etc. They were the big dogs. <br />
<br />
Anyways. What are things like now? Theres very few communities, and the communities that ARE around, arent very good. <br />
<br />
Now a days, everybody thinks they know everything. People will lie about what they can do (more than before) and people go off and try to teach what they dont know. Noobs will come in, and get completely mislead by one of these people. Nobody is reliable anymore, at all. There is NO good reliable source to learn from. Along with that, most websites are completely dead. <br />
<br />
PsionicsOnline: For a while, I really thought these guys were the answer to all this. Perfect community, still the top choice IMO. But, they are now dead, and when somebody does seldomly post, its a fluffster. &quot;I can make a flame, but, only a small one cause i&#039;m not too good yet..&quot; kind of things. <br />
<br />
PsiOnline: Dead.<br />
<br />
Ppsociety: Also dead.<br />
<br />
Psion Guild: Pretty much dead..a few posts every once in a while, but really not. My only problem with this place is, its almost exactly what I described above. Too many fluffers, not enough serious practitioners, and too many people teaching what they dont know. Theres one or two goodies, but the bad&#039;s outweigh the good&#039;s. <br />
<br />
Shifted Perspectives: Same thing. A new guy will show up, get totally mislead..after a month they will claim to be able to make a living construct, and shoot pencils around. &quot;Hey! I&#039;m pretty good friends with him, I trust him..Lets make this 14 year old kid a teacher, and have him mislead all these people!&quot; People around there (complete new guys, too) will go and try to make some sort of construct, whatever it may be, and just assume its there. &quot;My buddy scanned it and said it was there, so it must be.&quot; Wrong. I asked somebody to show me, once. He told me he&#039;d put it infont of me, so I could scan it. *facepalm* Theres nothing wrong with scanning. But see, you cant use it to verify everything. You do realize, you could be wrong? Doing things like that used to be called playing with imaginary friends. <br />
<br />
The big guys are gone now (the PsiPog mods, the people who had a clue, etc), and now us kids are left to manage things on our own. And damn, its not working one bit. Too many people became uninterested, too many left. Now we have more and more new guys coming in, getting mislead, and everything is just a giant cluster. The psionic information we&#039;ve discovered over the years is going to diminish, and there will be nothing left of psionics but a bunch of people playing pretend. <br />
<br />
IMO, without the oldies coming back, we&#039;re all screwed. Unless, maybe, we stop all this. Perhaps we could sort of &quot;re start&quot; psionics? Forget everything we know about psionics, and completely start anew? <br />
<br />
I believe psionics starting out something like this: Something weird happened to somebody. Maybe he kept on accidentally saying things others were thinking. Or maybe he accidentally moved a cup. Next, he experimented with his weird experience and tried to make it happen again. After he had a good feel for it, he told others how he went about it and they began doing it..and it grew from there.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry if I offended people out there. Maybe you agree with me, but to not extreme of a degree, or maybe you dont agree with me at all. Its fine. But tell me what you think.</div>

<br />
I&#039;m not that pessimistic though. I think that there is hope as long as PsiPog is still online or archived somewhere.<br />
<br />
Even if there are no online communities, psionics can&#039;t be considered dead because there are still people who practice.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it is so rare to practice psionics that feeling alone is more-or-less inevitable.</div>

After awhile I didnt even check out the forums because spam overwhelmed good threads.<br />

I used to practice with two people, Lucidess (who became a great friend of mine but lost internet)<br />
and Bob Stian_stew (who left to a new university or something and Ive never heard again)<br />
They left to pursue their own path, every psion eventually does it.<br />
Psionics is an individual thing, once you read everything that can be read you kind of understand how to do ANYTHING. Still, you seek interesting thoughts you never had but at that point ideas and thoughts is the only thing you will gain from a community.<br />
<br />
The rest is gained by practice, meditation and will.. which is something communities don&#039;t often offer. (Oh, everything is possible in theory, but no, no one at the moment is able to flip cars over with his mind, anyone pretending to is just full of crap)<br />

I really would love a new, fresh and intelligent community and I hope for it,<br />

Well,i personally think that perhaps there MAY be someone who can already do extreme things such as flipping the car with mind,but it&#039;s just that nobody know whether it&#039;s real or fluff.<br />
Well,we could never know or verify it,if the person want to avoid the public of it.<br />
<br />
Besides,fluffs may be extremely annoying,but it can(or perhaps) also bring the community out of boundaries,performing the impossible.<br />
Just imagine that a new guy believed fluffs and actually perform them,wouldn&#039;t that be wonderful?<br />
Lol! (And i seriously do not encourage fluffs though,just let people do what they want,don&#039;t bother them.)<br />
