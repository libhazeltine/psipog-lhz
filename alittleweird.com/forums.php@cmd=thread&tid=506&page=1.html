		<div id="post_10677" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yeah acctually, I do... It helps move the conversation along.<br />
<br />
I first learned about it watching an Anime (holds back the hoards from their keyboards). I was fairly interested in the subject, so I started to read information on how the chakra system, in it&#039;s entirety, it formed. And it seems to be like a system similar, if no directly related to, both our nervous and circulatory system. The best way to describe the Chakra system is the entire system of our energy flow. Including heat radiation and the like. In certain locations there are Limiters on the body in order to protect it. Both spiritual and physical limiters are placed.<br />
<br />
The most common one you&#039;ll here about is the Kundalini, which lies at the base of the spine and carries a lot of energy ^_-.<br />
<br />
How do you do this? Hmm, I&#039;m not really sure how to explain it. It depends on which one you&#039;re trying to break. If you were to ask me what the first mental gate requires, I would say that you must combine your (upper, the part that you talk to) subconscious mind with your conscious mind much in the same manner that you would fuse a split personality. This, if I remember correctly, will increase energy manipulation, your overall sense of spiritual awareness, a sense that you understand what&#039;s going on everywhere at any time, and overall a sense of bliss. I think this is correlated with the seventh chakra in the most direct sense.<br />
<br />
I think I have broken 3 limiters so far, and can open up to 5. This means that I have (I think) Permanently unlocked the gates of Thought, light and Sound.<br />
<br />
The gate of thought is related to the seventh chakra by my understanding, And it is supposed to unlock the full ability of my seventh chakra. IN other words, just a feeling of bliss, understanding, and spiritual connection.<br />
<br />
The gate of light is directly correlated with both physical and intuitive sight, With this I have experienced huge improvements on Aura Sight, mental capacity (I can think clearer and further ahead than I once was able to) and I can physically see in darker places much further ahead of what I was once able to, this is where I hit my first repercussion, In broad daylight I am starting to get headaches just from having my eyes open, and I constantly see a &quot;Gray haze&quot; around objects similar to what seems to be described a lot in OBEs.<br />
<br />
The Gate of Sound is the chakra located in the throat, and is supposed to be related to communication and creativity. With this I have finally diagnosed correctly my computer&#039;s problem with rebooting through a stroke of creative genius ^_-. (I found that the wire leading to the fan on the top of the computer on the power supply end was loose and I switched them, since then, I haven&#039;t had any restarting issues.) And I have increased perception of peoples thoughts and emotions, as well as an experience of increased physical hearing. This has also given the repercussion of aiding in headaches with even the slighted amount of sound. I fear here that If not left in check, I may experience migraines and possibly seizures. only time will tell...<br />
<br />
The other two gates I can unlock, but not permanently or at least without effort, are the Gates of air and Fire...<br />
<br />
The Gate of Air allows me to integrate opposites into union for a deep sense of both physical and spiritual centeredness.<br />
<br />
The Gate of Fire allows me personal power, will, and autonomy, as well as increased metabolism. When this one is open I note an extremely increased sense of balance as well as a boost of physical power. But I won&#039;t know more until I can unlock it without effort.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have not found anything suitable to accurately describe the chakra system, including the secondary chakras, the nadis, and otherwise the more detailed information on the chakra system.<br />
<br />
The Best I could come up with that even begins to describe the information is located at  <a href="http://www.rickrichards.com/chakras/Chakras1a.html" target="_blank">http://www.rickrichards.com/chakras/Chakras1a.html</a><br />

The energy system you describe, it might simply be helpful for me to give you the word Meridian (the channels you speak of) from Chinese Medicine. I know it best from Shiatsu which is actually a japanese form of touch therapy built from the chinese practice of Anma. Unfortunately a chart is going to be complicated around the head. At the same time its really not what your looking for if you want it to intertwine with chakras and the other systems involved with pranas and nadi.<br />

on your other post, I could basically tell you that I feel the limiters in my body, along the path of chakra flow, I feel and just visualize the gate. Then, I either force it open with my current energy (which requires substantial focus to keep open by the way) or I force it open to the point where the energy the chakra point puts out itself keeps it open. The odd thing about it is that I feel If I wanted to, I could close the gates that I&#039;ve &quot;broken&quot; through, but I&#039;ve no desire to... I know this doesn&#039;t cover the whole process, but I can&#039;t explain more without research ^.^.<br />

I guess you could say that, rather, I try to send energy into the chakra point, so it &quot;reacts&quot; to it... Like I said before... It&#039;s like a gate. <br />
<br />
I guess the best explanation of it would be a source of a specific energy sealed off in a type of &quot;chamber&quot; of the body. there is an entrance which is like a giant stone gate, It opens inwardly, causing the gate to stay shut and regulated normally. Then you &quot;force open&quot; the gate you begin to feel the energy rushing out, but until you fully open the gate, the energy it contains pushes the gate close. When you do open the gate enough, it turns back onto the inside walls of the chamber, the energy pushing out turns to your favor and holds the gate open for you. <br />
<br />
I know I need to start uploading pics to describe what I&#039;m talking about (it would make things much easier), but until I can get a place to store it, I&#039;m out of luck in that aspect...<br />

not to nitpick but i think it would actually make your night vision worse,  while the outer part of your eye tries to adjust to the dark, the center is being scorched by the bright TV/PC screen,  <br />
