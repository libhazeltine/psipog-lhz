<br />
I remember with PK, there were a few instances where I slid fairly large things. I dont see how else I couldve done it. A long time ago I was unable to spin a covered psiwheel. Now I can. I also watched this, wich boosted my belief up a bit:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw_O9Qiwqew" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw_O9Qiwqew</a><br />
<br />
I&#039;ve gotten proof with micro PK also. I do the dice thing. I roll the dice about 100 times, tally everything it lands on. Making sure nothings too out. Then, I try to force a number. First number to 10 wins. Most of the time, thats the number. I&#039;d say about 4/5 times. Plus theres 6 numbers. Average them together, I&#039;d say its pretty significant. <br />
<br />
The geiger counter stuff was also pretty good for my belief. I didnt see it happen, but I trust Sean. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve done more than this. I&#039;ve gotten pretty awesome stuff with energy manipulation, telepathy, clairvoyance, etc that was very convincing and proving. I&#039;ve impressed lots of people with these things too. Thats why I believe. </div>

<br />
science uses inductive reasoning too, but they tend to do it heaps better then the average person.<br />

but anyway, most of the things i believe in, i believe in because they fit AND i havent had the time and resources to falsify it, which make it more of an opinion really. <br />

psionics - pretty much all of it is by personal experience, except RVing which i tallied results for and measured the probability against,, that was quite succesful<br />
<br />
that everything is connected and comes from the one conciousness, which experiences everything subjectively through &#039;separate&#039; conciousness&#039; - i dont really know why i believe this one, its one of those ones where it is falsifiable, but probably not practically testable. i think the fact it provides a simple solution to the mechanic of telepathy, but there are probably more testable theories that are just as, or more, simple.<br />
<br />
it is my belief that the &#039;random&#039; effect of the quantum collapse of the wavefunction is actually derived from the state of conciousness at that particular point in space and time, thus allowing us to manipulate random number generators and interact with our bodies via the brain (which has quantum osscillators inside the neurons), and maybe small scale effects which cause macropk based on the butterfly effect (the macropk ones probably one of the more shaky ones). -this because its the simplest explaination i can come up with for pk (remember what i said about inductive reasoning. also, i could never get my head around newtons third law with respect to pk)<br />
<br />
i believe that the reality we percieve is not &#039;absolute&#039; or &#039;ultimate&#039; in the sense that i believe there is a more fundamental layer of reality then the one we percieve (based on, but not exactly the same as, the life is a simulation arguments).<br />

		<div id="post_11034" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Most things I believe in because I&#039;ve seen it with my own eyes, and confirmed I wasn&#039;t self-deluded.  It can be hard to confirm whether something is real or not... but what is even harder is to take all the things that have been witnessed as real, and start coming up with an explanation for them :-).  That problem is light-years ahead of just witnessing something bizarre :-).<br />
<br />
So I&#039;ll go down the list...<br />
<br />
Psi Balls/Constructs - exercises produced results.  Confirmed I wasn&#039;t making it up in my head via getting others to feel the construct in my hand, and throwing it over a digital thermometer (and watching the temperature go up).  Advanced constructs produced &quot;unexpected&quot; results, which is evidence that my expectation isn&#039;t what&#039;s driving the constructs... some experiences outlined in:  <a href="http://psipog.net/art-advanced-constructs-log.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/art-advanced-constructs-log.html</a><br />
<br />
Empathy - lots of experiences where a reading led to interesting predictions, followed by the prediction coming true.  I could name a few, but they are emotional, and personal :-).<br />
<br />
Telepathy - not as many experiences, but a few stand out.  Sending images in the PsiPog practice room (  <a href="http://psipog.net/art-images-with-subc.html" target="_blank">http://psipog.net/art-images-with-subc.html</a> ).  &quot;Hearing&quot; a friends voice, followed by them saying exactly what I just heard.  One interesting experience (that convinced my father I wasn&#039;t insane), was one where I was away from home for a week.  During my time away, I connected to my father.  I closed my eyes and saw a silhouette of a person laying down in front of me, and it felt like I wasn&#039;t at my father&#039;s home.  Upon returning home, I asked my dad, &quot;Did you sleep at home on Tuesday night?&quot;  Upon which he replied &quot;.......... Nooo.... why?&quot; :-)  I was correct in my perception, and freaked out my dad in the process, because he was keeping it a secret from me :-).<br />
<br />
Clairvoyance/Remote Viewing - overlaps with telepathy.<br />
<br />
OBEs - hundreds of experiences.  One in particular is what convinced me that what I was experiencing wasn&#039;t purely a hallucination.   <a href="http://www.psipog.net/blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html</a>  Since then, I&#039;ve had a few more that have re-enforced that conclusion.<br />
<br />
By extension, I believe a lot of what Robert Monroe, Robert Peterson, and to a lesser extent Robert Bruce have written about OBEs - because my experiences align with theirs a lot, so it&#039;s reasonable to assume that as I keep going, I will continue to experience similar things that they write about.<br />
<br />
Psychokinesis - not a lot of personal experience, except for the psi-wheel, and a little bit of wobbling of pens.  Not enough to personally convince me of anything.  However, seeing the geiger counter results with JoeT, and just having a relationship with JoeT, NI, and Float, has convinced me of it&#039;s existence.<br />
<br />
DMILs - tried it once, and succeeded.  Didn&#039;t really interest me enough to keep going, and my experience made sense (it doesn&#039;t even seem &quot;paranormal&quot; to me), so not a big deal, imho.  Basically used visualization to alter my body (bigger bicep muscles, at the time, without exercise).<br />
<br />
Precognition - I have a hard time with this, because it overlaps with my empathy.  I can make some accurate predictions, but to me, it seems like I&#039;m just playing out the emotional landscape of events, and coming to an obvious conclusion.  I&#039;ve read some books claiming that what I&#039;m doing is actually precognition, but my belief system won&#039;t allow me to admit it to myself :-).<br />
<br />
Anything I missed?<br />

Psi Balls/Constructs - exercises produced results.  Confirmed I wasn&#039;t making it up in my head via getting others to feel the construct in my hand, and throwing it over a digital thermometer (and watching the temperature go up).  Advanced constructs produced &quot;unexpected&quot; results, which is evidence that my expectation isn&#039;t what&#039;s driving the constructs... some experiences outlined in: http://psipog.net/art-advanced-constructs-log.html

Empathy - lots of experiences where a reading led to interesting predictions, followed by the prediction coming true.  I could name a few, but they are emotional, and personal :-).

Telepathy - not as many experiences, but a few stand out.  Sending images in the PsiPog practice room ( http://psipog.net/art-images-with-subc.html ).  &quot;Hearing&quot; a friends voice, followed by them saying exactly what I just heard.  One interesting experience (that convinced my father I wasn&#039;t insane), was one where I was away from home for a week.  During my time away, I connected to my father.  I closed my eyes and saw a silhouette of a person laying down in front of me, and it felt like I wasn&#039;t at my father&#039;s home.  Upon returning home, I asked my dad, &quot;Did you sleep at home on Tuesday night?&quot;  Upon which he replied &quot;.......... Nooo.... why?&quot; :-)  I was correct in my perception, and freaked out my dad in the process, because he was keeping it a secret from me :-).

Clairvoyance/Remote Viewing - overlaps with telepathy.

OBEs - hundreds of experiences.  One in particular is what convinced me that what I was experiencing wasn&#039;t purely a hallucination.  http://www.psipog.net/blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html  Since then, I&#039;ve had a few more that have re-enforced that conclusion.

By extension, I believe a lot of what Robert Monroe, Robert Peterson, and to a lesser extent Robert Bruce have written about OBEs - because my experiences align with theirs a lot, so it&#039;s reasonable to assume that as I keep going, I will continue to experience similar things that they write about.

Psychokinesis - not a lot of personal experience, except for the psi-wheel, and a little bit of wobbling of pens.  Not enough to personally convince me of anything.  However, seeing the geiger counter results with JoeT, and just having a relationship with JoeT, NI, and Float, has convinced me of it&#039;s existence.

DMILs - tried it once, and succeeded.  Didn&#039;t really interest me enough to keep going, and my experience made sense (it doesn&#039;t even seem &quot;paranormal&quot; to me), so not a big deal, imho.  Basically used visualization to alter my body (bigger bicep muscles, at the time, without exercise).

Precognition - I have a hard time with this, because it overlaps with my empathy.  I can make some accurate predictions, but to me, it seems like I&#039;m just playing out the emotional landscape of events, and coming to an obvious conclusion.  I&#039;ve read some books claiming that what I&#039;m doing is actually precognition, but my belief system won&#039;t allow me to admit it to myself :-).

Anything I missed?

subconscious once I discovered psipog and read the article about communicating with my subconscious, I have been communicating with my subconscious. In one of the 50-some minute periods at the end of school I decide that I want to ask my subconscious what attributes I have as a person. To my surprise it answered with exactly 50 attributes. In the summer I decided I wanted my subconscious to write a story with whatever words come into its mind first. It makes very little sense and is very disturbing, so chances are it is encoded and I&#039;ll need to ask my subconscious about its true meaning.<br />

other paranormal activity Ever since I was little, whenever I lie down on the ground I feel as if I am just going to fall &quot;up&quot;. i would get very hyper for no reason at times when other people are exhausted. When i come back to school from being sick knowing the material better than those who were not sick. EX: I was sick and missed a Latin test on friday, I came back took the test after finding out that even the top three kids in the class did not get A&#039;s on the test. I got a 100 on it. (very little studying if I ever did study)</div>

So in my mind it was therefore real to me. Then in highschool is when it started to really fall into place. I started to have precognitive visions, and really strong empathic stuff and then hated to be around other people because of empathy. After that i really started to get into the whole psychic phenomonon thing. That is when i found Psipog. Then i got good at psi wheel, RV, and such, and then i learned how to sheild so i didnt feel so weird around people. Then during my sophmore year i started to see dead people (Cliché i know). And now i am what i am. so for the most part seeing (or feeling) is beliving.</div>

		<div id="post_11076" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The reason I believe is because of personal experience. I don&#039;t know if I can offically say I believe in macro TK, (still trying to actually move something:S), but I do believe in telepathy, possibly precognition, and remote viewing, those kinds of paranormal things that have to do with the mind and thoughts or whatever the terms are:S I&#039;ve had personal experience with telepathy that I can definitely say led to my full belief of the phenomenon, which beforehand, I couldn&#039;t say whether or not I believed. I think with telekinesis, I will have to actually be able to do it myself to believe it or see someone else do it right in front of my eyes, I mean, with something more than a psi wheel. (no offense to the psi wheel, I&#039;m using it myself right now, but it would be something to see someone slide a glass full of water around a table or lift a book a foot into the air) <br />
<br />
Telepathy- Was sitting around with 3 people, suddenly asked them all to think of a color, guessed all colors right in first try. &lt;defining experience <br />
Was writing this letter once with pictures (choose the letter then use a corresponding picture that matches the letter, like if I wanted to write the word AND, I&#039;d use APPLE, NOOSE, DOG., then that same day, my sister sees my letter and freaks out and shows me the letter she wrote that same day with the same exact method.&lt;this seems telepathic to me...right:S<br />
<br />
Clairvoyance- About 8 years ago, I was sitting with my sister watching tv then all of a sudden I felt this strange feeling like something huge and life-altering was going to happen. Hit me like a wall (i&#039;m not exagerrating) So I turned to her grabbed her arm and said something like, &quot;Something huge is going to happen soon. I can feel it. Something that will change the course of life here&quot; Something silly like that, and then a few months later, 9/11 happens. &lt;I don&#039;t know if this story counts as anything more than a coincidence, but it happened and I thought it was interesting.<br />

I&#039;ve also had a significant mystical experience, but that probably doesn&#039;t have much to do with the topic.   </div>
