<br />
I stop in occasionally and peruse the forums (Sheepking is watching, scary huh?) and just thought I&#039;d drop a few lines to you all.<br />
<br />
You may or may not know that I&#039;m in the military (special forces drop out all the way)and thus find myself very busy/occupied building up my future goals for when I am out, working, and staying healthy. <br />
<br />
I think about Psi, memories about the communities, and all the friends I&#039;ve met along the way.

<br />
I think about my perspective on Psi when I was a kid (13? 14?), when it all started for me and these awesome ideas I had about what Psi could do, and the whole magical feel it had. Times do change. At 22 years old my perspective is much different than it was before; things don&#039;t &quot;excite me&quot; as much as they used to. Things became familiar, and then boring for a time.<br />

Occasionally my interest is renewed, as is how it normally goes, by some sequence of events, boredom, or strings of coincidence that make me wonder (is something calling to me?). Instead of preaching some false sense of confidence that this time is different, and declaring my intentions to me part of some grand scheme to reorganize things I&#039;ll offer some insight to you that I have learned in general.<br />
<br />
Insight:<br />
<br />
1. Never stop practicing. Day in and day out find the time to try and use your skills. If you have trouble finding applications or ways to practice you have a serious disability if you wish to pursue psi. Your ultimate goal should be to integrate your psi skills into REAL LIFE situations. <br />
<br />
2. Goals. Form goals, short term, mid term, and long term. Assign dates and deadlines and hold yourself to these. Without these goals you can not see if you are advancing or retreating. Any person or organization who wants to go anywhere needs goals.<br />
<br />
3. Grow. Always seek to expand yourself, your mind, and help the people around you to do the same. Without growth you go no where. Explore your ideas, document them, catalog them, learn from them. <br />
<br />
4. Truth. I consider truth one of my highest, if not the highest belief. Truth is the ability to see reality as much as possible. This is not about life from your view point, it&#039;s about life in general. Imagine as if you were omniscient and attempt to see things from that perspective, understand how everything plays out, and how everything fits together. Our minds put us at a disadvantage of sorts, and society conditions us away from Truth. Detach a little and look inward and outward. Remove self deceit, recognize failures, speak the Truth.<br />
<br />
5. Research. Find new sources of information; Find documentation and ways to support or disprove yourself. Do not be biased.<br />
<br />
6. Balance. Balance your time, set quotas of some sort to focus on the things that are important to you. How much time do you or did you spend on online communites, vs. how much time were you practicing, reading/researching, or trying to understand reality and psi? The last year or so of PsiPog I socialized more than I practiced, expanded my mind, or grew in some way. This also applies to life outside of Psi. Exercise, Live healthy, Socialize, and damnit...

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_16199">Good morning (12:44 AM) Everyone,

I stop in occasionally and peruse the forums (Sheepking is watching, scary huh?) and just thought I&#039;d drop a few lines to you all.

You may or may not know that I&#039;m in the military (special forces drop out all the way)and thus find myself very busy/occupied building up my future goals for when I am out, working, and staying healthy. 

I think about Psi, memories about the communities, and all the friends I&#039;ve met along the way. I recall how things evolved from me being a regular on the forums at Psipog to becoming an author/moderator, some of the events that led to falling out and falling in with Sean, and just the whole circus that was.

Instead of preaching some false sense of confidence that this time is different, and declaring my intentions to me part of some grand scheme to reorganize things I&#039;ll offer some insight to you that I have learned in general.

Insight:

1. Never stop practicing. Day in and day out find the time to try and use your skills. If you have trouble finding applications or ways to practice you have a serious disability if you wish to pursue psi. Your ultimate goal should be to integrate your psi skills into REAL LIFE situations. 

2. Goals. Form goals, short term, mid term, and long term. Assign dates and deadlines and hold yourself to these. Without these goals you can not see if you are advancing or retreating. Any person or organization who wants to go anywhere needs goals.

That is, of course, if you have access to such. I&#039;m not saying break into the top secret files for us, but just information from the military scientists off and on about what goes on in these anomalous energies and what doesn&#039;t. Academic scientists won&#039;t go for any acceptance of remote viewing, PK, etc. but as evidenced from Operation Stargate, the armed forces scientists did and will.  </div>

You tell someone you can read thoughts sometimes; see things separated by time and space; move objects with your mind; influence things... And they have this look of doubtful agreement. Like they&#039;re talking to a two year old saying, &quot;Wow, that&#039;s amazing.&quot; <br />

I would usually start with &quot;I&#039;m interested in the paranormal&quot;, which is fairly acceptable since there are a lot of paranormal shows on TV and everything.  Then just let the conversation evolve from there.  In the cases where I went so far as to say I could see images and read thoughts, then I got the really strange looks and &quot;ok please stop talking to me now&quot; vibe :-).<br />
<br />
My goals have been moving out of the abstract world, and into the physical.  I bought a house recently, so I&#039;m focusing on home improvement, exercising, eating healthy, cooking, the ladies, and work.  &quot;Normal&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t practiced energy manipulation in.... years?  I don&#039;t really remember.  Every once in a while I&#039;ll play around with it, for that nostalgic feeling :-).  I haven&#039;t touched RV in a long time, even though I really enjoyed doing that back in the day.<br />
<br />
The only thing I&#039;ve trained on recently is OBEs... but my method is 95% effective (for me), so I can have an OBE just about whenever I want... so it&#039;s not really a matter of training now.  It&#039;s more a matter of: &quot;Ok, I&#039;m out, now what?&quot;  My experiences aren&#039;t nearly as cool and exciting as those I&#039;ve read about (although they are still fairly cool, and I do love having OBEs).<br />
<br />
The failed experiments I posted on MDP kind of sucked my motivation a little bit.  Some of those trials I was pretty damn confident... only to have zero numbers correct.  I think I&#039;m going to move those experiments over to ALW at some point, since I think they have value.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say I&#039;ve shifted from obsession to idle curiosity.  Of course, these things go in cycles... so it could just be a matter of time before it ramps back up :-).  We shall see.<br />
<br />
(But really, part of me just thinks I&#039;m getting too old for this stuff... perhaps I think, &quot;It&#039;s been a good run, maybe it&#039;s time to move on?&quot;... Then another part of me realizes how much it&#039;s affected my life... and &quot;move on&quot; to what, exactly?  Just thoughts.)<br />
