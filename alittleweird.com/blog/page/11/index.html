					<p>In light of dealing with skeptics on <a href="http://ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=392022">ld4all.com</a>&#8217;s message boards, I will offer multiple ways to prove psychic abilities are real.  There are two main paths: do the research, or experience the phenomenon.  Feel free to do both at the same time for double the proof.</p>
<h3>Do the Research</h3>

<p>The links and books above give more than enough proof.  How many of you searching for proof will actually read any of it though?  The information is usually pretty dry, I admit.  Nonetheless, if you really want that scientific proof - there you go. It&#8217;s all at your fingertips.  The only thing holding you back is your ability to read.</p>
<h3>Experience the Phenomenon</h3>
<p>The path that I personally enjoy is to experience the phenomenon directly.  You can&#8217;t really argue with personal experience!  Oh sure, after you have a bunch of weird experiences, people will look at you differently.  Some will call you crazy, and tell you what you experienced was simply impossible.  Some will treat you like a circus animal, asking you to perform on cue for their personal amusement.  Some will say you&#8217;re a liar, and that you&#8217;re trying to deceive people for profit.  But hey - if you really want that proof - you&#8217;ll need to make some sacrifices.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There you go.  There&#8217;s your proof.  Everything you need - right there.  A lot of the information is free on the web.  Purchasing books does cost some money, but surely it&#8217;s not that much.  Maybe $10 per book.  If you&#8217;re going to invest in only one book, my personal favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Psychic-Free-Method/dp/0684857049/ref=sr_1_1/105-7809629-6052428?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184948230&amp;sr=8-1">You Are Psychic!</a>, by Pete A. Sanders.  It gives a lot of great exercises to try and has a nice explanation for how psychic phenomenon might work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that hard to prove psychic abilities are real.  The actual work involved isn&#8217;t that much.  Mainly it consists of reading.  If you decide to try some exercises, they aren&#8217;t difficult either.  What usually happens is that people refuse to do the research because they&#8217;re lazy, or they refuse to try an exercise because they feel silly.  Then they proclaim that psychic abilities can&#8217;t exist because they&#8217;ve never seen proof.  Well no duh.</p>
<p>One last thing: This is by no means an exhaustive list.  Use Google.  Search.  Go to a library.  Actually GO TO A LIBRARY.  I spent countless hours at the University of Georgia&#8217;s library, reading random books on psi research.  The main keywords to look for are &#8220;telepathy&#8221;, &#8220;clairvoyance&#8221;, &#8220;esp&#8221;, and &#8220;psychokinesis&#8221;.  Searching for other terms doesn&#8217;t usually produce results.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

				<div class="entry" id="entry_51">
					<p>Let&#8217;s say you won a couple million.  What would you do with the money?</p>
<p>&#8220;Two chicks at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you Office Space.  Nonetheless, despite the cliché, it&#8217;s a good question to ask.</p>
<p>When I first thought about winning the lottery, I imagined myself back at the University of Georgia, learning about everything.  Music theory, engineering, brain science, math, physics, psychology, religion, astronomy, computer animation&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t have to focus on one major, and could go at my own pace.</p>
<p>For my lifestyle, I imagined myself exercising every day, having a cool place to live, lots of books, lots of cool gadgets, perhaps some hottie college girlfriend.  I&#8217;d be living close to some of my friends from Georgia, and it&#8217;d be great hanging out with them, having a good time.  I&#8217;d love to travel as well&#8230; see the different cultures and landmarks around Earth.  I imagined opening a book store where people could go to hang out.  I would have different events that would be fun&#8230; group discussions, debates, guest speakers, activities, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways - back to the point.  The question immediately becomes: why not work towards that right now?</p>
<p>So lately, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing.  I pick something off the list of &#8220;if I had a shitton of money&#8230;&#8221;, and do it.  A lot of the things on my list don&#8217;t require any money.  For example, I can study all those topics on my own.  I don&#8217;t need to pay a teacher.  In fact, when I was in college, I rarely went to class because the teachers always did such a piss poor job.  These past two weeks I&#8217;ve been studying music theory, and composing different songs.  It&#8217;s fun :-).</p>
<p>I also started exercising a while ago (which I mentioned in another post).  Why wait until I have a big number in my bank account to go running in the sun?</p>
<p>I guess it all seems really obvious though.  Especially in hindsight.  99% of the things I listed don&#8217;t even require huge sums of money.  A lot of winning the money is just a boost in confidence.  I bet I could even open a book store without a ton of money, if that&#8217;s what I really want to do.  Traveling isn&#8217;t that expensive either (<a href="http://wherethehellismatt.com/">right Matt?</a>).</p>
<p>I mean&#8230; fuck.  We <em>are</em> free.  Am I looking for the courage to win the lottery, or looking for the courage to live my life how I truly want to live it?  *shrugs*</p>
<p>What would you do with large sums of money?</p>

				<div class="entry" id="entry_48">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about money and value lately with the purpose of trying to uncover limiting beliefs that could be holding me back from winning the lottery.</p>
<p>Before I get into it, let me say one thing.  The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason/dp/0451205367/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-7809629-6052428?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184430674&amp;sr=8-2"><em>The Richest Man in Babylon</em></a>, by George S. Clason, is an unbelievably awesome book on money.  I highly recommend it - it&#8217;s one of my favorites that I&#8217;ve read multiple times.</p>
<p>So anyways&#8230; on thinking about money and business, I notice that a lot of businesses are based on lies.  And that bothers me.  Just watch some commercials.  Not skinny enough?  We can fix that.  Not getting enough sleep?  We can fix that.  Dick isn&#8217;t big enough?  We can fix that.  Clothes not cool enough?  We can fix that.  Not happy enough?  We got some pills you can take!</p>
<p>I mean&#8230; so many businesses are based on convincing the customer that they won&#8217;t be happy until they buy a product.  They target an insecurity and exploit it for profit.  That&#8217;s pretty fucking rude :-P.</p>
<p>But then I suppose I should be fair.  There are businesses that actually provide a useful service, that deserve their success.  For example, FedEx, Google, NetFlix, Amazon, etc.  They provide a service without preying on their customers.</p>
<p>So where is the value?  I don&#8217;t think there is any value in exploiting insecurities.  But I do think there is value in providing an honest service.</p>
<p>I want to say that the value of something is ultimately created in the mind.  But I can&#8217;t see it clearly just yet.  Or maybe I can&#8230;</p>
<p>After all, if no one was insecure about how fat they are, then diet commercials that tried to target a non-existent insecurity would be ineffective.  Should I be blaming the business, or should I be blaming the customer for having the insecurity in the first place?  Where is the value created?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the customer who creates the value.  It is the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>A mighty general was holding and admiring one of his antique cups. Suddenly, the cup slipped from his hands and fell. Although in shock, he quickly caught the cup before it hit the ground. Somewhat breathless from this incident, he thought to himself, &#8220;I have led tens of thousands of soldiers into battle without fear. Why did a cup cause me to become so frightened?&#8221; He then realized that it was his mind of attachment and loss that caused him such fright. With this comprehension, he casually threw the cup to the ground and let it break.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Today I present two short posts in one:</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that I just had an out-of-arm-experience.  I have these every once in a while.  Someone called me at 9:45am speaking Spanish that woke me up.  I went back to bed in a weird state of mind.  I did dream some, but I also experienced laying in bed messing around with my arms.</p>
<p>The experience went on and off for about 20 minutes.  I was laying in bed, looking at my wall, and my arms were &#8220;out&#8221; of my body.  I couldn&#8217;t see them, but I could sense where they were.  I moved them in front of my face, trying to see them, but no luck.  I felt my face with my hands, and my hands felt my face, but my face didn&#8217;t feel my hands.  It was pretty cool.  I had an experience like it before, years ago when I was 16 years old.</p>
<p>I almost decided not to post about it, because it was a mundane experience, but there was one important feature.  On my wall, I have playing cards taped to it for decoration.  While having these out of arm experiences, I focused on one of the playing cards to keep my consciousness aware.  When I woke up, it dawned on me that I should check that specific card to see if I perceived it correctly.  While in the bathroom, I predicted the card would be dark with two symbols on the front.  When I checked, I was correct - it was exactly as I remembered it.  This isn&#8217;t die-hard proof of anything, however it is an interesting thing to note.</p>
<p>In other news&#8230; <a href="../../../2007/04/30/steorn/index.html">Steorn</a>, the guys who claim to have discovered perpetual motion, had a public demonstration July 6th, 2007.  Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/07/steorns-ceo-states-the-obvious-we-screwed-up/">they couldn&#8217;t get their technology to work</a>.  Here is a video of Sean McCarthy making excuses.  I didn&#8217;t watch the whole thing because of the bad quality and length, but maybe someone else is interested:</p>

					<p>I lost this round.  I spent $12 on lottery tickets for Friday&#8217;s drawing, and lost.</p>
<p>I went to bed pissed off.  But I woke up with the solution.  Funny how that works..? <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>For those that think I&#8217;m crazy, let me reassure you: no one questions my sanity more than myself :-).  Perhaps it is all just random, and I&#8217;m putting myself through this for no good reason whatsoever.  That thought certainly crosses my mind.  However - I can&#8217;t deny my observations.  And once I start thinking about my observations, I quickly regain my confidence, and realize that I can win the jackpot if I remain persistent.  I&#8217;ve made intelligent decisions up to this point, and I&#8217;m confident in my logic so far.  I&#8217;m just need to keep going.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m addicted to gambling?  Heh, that thought is truly ridiculous for anyone who knows me.  I have a very non-addictive personality, and I aggressively avoid anything that just <em>might</em> cause an addiction.  In fact, that&#8217;s one of the main reasons I stopped playing scratch off lottery tickets.  I observed my emotions moving a millimeter towards addiction, and cut it off immediately.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is a list of ideas that I will have to resolve:</p>
<h3>1. There is no such thing as randomness <em>-or-</em> Do I have the courage to live in a world without randomness?</h3>
<p>Now I know I&#8217;ve addressed this topic before.  However, parts of my mind still rely on this idea of randomness to &#8220;patch things up&#8221; that I&#8217;m not entirely aware of.  For example, on July 4th I drove home from work differently so I could get some gas.  I didn&#8217;t realize that the path I had chosen would result in a shit load of traffic because people were watching fireworks.  This pissed me off, and it&#8217;s possible part of myself said that my suffering was random (or: it was random that I inadvertently decided to get gas at that specific day and time, where there was excessive traffic).  To be pissed is to deny the order of the universe.</p>
<p>I find myself making decisions based on a belief in randomness.  Let me outline exactly what I mean, because this is the main reason why I lost this past drawing.  Imagine a chess game :-), and I&#8217;m white.  Now, as I move my chess pieces around the board, and develop a strategy, I have to try to predict what my opponent is going to do, and prepare myself for their attacks, and also counter-attack at the same time.  How does my prediction process work?  At some point, I might try to think of random moves my opponent would make, in order to figure out how I would respond.</p>
<p>I do this with reality.  It&#8217;s a wonderful tool for decision making.  I think to myself, &#8220;When I get out of the Air Force, I will go back to college.  However, if the Air Force refuses to pay for my college (even though they said they would), then I need to have a backup plan.  And if I win the lottery, then I don&#8217;t need to worry about that.  But if I don&#8217;t win the lottery, and the Air Force screws me over, then what do I do?  In that case, I will find a good job with my decent resume.  However, this choice isn&#8217;t optimal because my resume wouldn&#8217;t include a Bachelors degree.&#8221; Now look at how many paths I&#8217;ve outlined in my head, and how those paths rely on the idea of randomness.</p>
<p>I have no explanation for why the Air Force would screw me over, however - it is possible and probable, so I must prepare for it (just like in the chess game).  But at the same time, if nothing is random, and everything happens for a reason, then why should I prepare?  Or more accurately: since the reason I prepare is because I foreshadow possible stressful situations, and I want to alleviate that imaginary stress: why should the Air Force screwing me over stress me out if nothing is truly random?</p>
<h3>2. What I will do with the money?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to solve this issue, but I still need some work.  It&#8217;s important for me to define (in a general sense) what I plan to do with the money - and start working towards that right now.  For example, a few months ago I had visualized myself in Georgia with $33 mil, exercising daily and running in the sun.  But while visualizing this, in reality I was a lazy bum, and didn&#8217;t exercise at all.  So, internally, the idea of winning the jackpot meant I could start exercising.  However, this is an unhealthy limitation, that puts a <em>need</em> on winning the jackpot.  Like so:  I need to be healthy = I need to exercise = I need to win the lottery.  Associating a <em>need</em> with the jackpot introduces failure.  The solution to that particular problem was to start running NOW.  Which is what I do.  I exercise 3-4 times a week.</p>
<p>Even though I solved that one problem, there are more.  What will I do with the money?  Is there a way I can start working towards my goals NOW?  Is there a way I can relieve this <em>need</em> to win?</p>
<h3>3. Am I cheating?</h3>
<p>I have this issue mostly resolved, but I have some more work to do here as well.  Am I cheating by winning the lottery?  In a way, yes.  I am betraying the trust of those who enter the lottery.  We have a preconception that this is a game of chance&#8230; if everyone knew it wasn&#8217;t a game of chance, and that it was a game of choice, would people still play?  Maybe more people would play :-P.  But nonetheless, the issue still exists.  If there exists one person who plays <em>because</em> it&#8217;s a game of chance, then I am cheating that person by using conscious choice to win.</p>
<p>Now the obvious solution to this is to realize that I can&#8217;t be accountable for someone else&#8217;s ignorance or misunderstanding.  But there&#8217;s still some negativity in this line of argument that needs to be resolved.</p>
<h3>4. Is it moral to get something for nothing?</h3>
<p>This is an interesting problem which needs some attention indeed.  I stumbled upon the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Blunders_of_the_World">Seven Blunders of the World</a>, by Gandhi.  (Flashback: by using the word &#8220;stumbled&#8221; in the previous sentence, am I affirming a form of randomness exists?).  Gandhi lists seven blunders that humans make, one of them being: wealth without work.</p>
<p>Now, in my head I&#8217;m clearly working hard for this win.  Look how much time and energy I&#8217;ve put into it so far.  I&#8217;m working, according to my own standards.  But I think I should give Gandhi a little more credit and think about this idea some more.  I&#8217;ve heard other people claim it&#8217;s ethically wrong to use intention manifestation to win the lottery because you&#8217;re getting &#8220;something for nothing&#8221;, but I really don&#8217;t care what they think.  However, when Gandhi says it, then perhaps I should perk up and pay attention :-P.</p>
<p>This brings up the topic of what is wealth, how society views wealth, the true value of something, what the natural order of things are regarding wealth and value, etc.  A lot of issues that need to be addressed, and I&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Looking over this list, and looking internally at the beliefs and thoughts in my head that need to be resolved, I still come to the same conclusion: I can do this.  I can overcome these obstacles in a positive way that will conclude with me winning the jackpot.  My goal is possible.  But I do have work to do, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I&#8217;ll get there just yet.  But the destination exists :-).</p>

				<div class="entry" id="entry_45">
					<p>The great thing about out of body experiences is that ANYONE can learn and see it with their own eyes.  Let&#8217;s start at ground zero:</p>
<h3>What is an Out of Body Experience?</h3>
<p>An out of body experience (OBE) is when you perceive your consciousness outside of your body.  The basic outline is that you lay down, meditate or trance out, and at some point you start to float outside your body.  Sometimes this feels so real that you&#8217;re not even sure if you&#8217;ve left your body.  There have been times when I&#8217;ve fallen out of my body, and thought I actually fell out of my bed physically!  Only to &#8220;wake up&#8221; back in my bed, slightly confused :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to wrap our minds around what an OBE actually is.  If you read about OBEs, then you might draw the simple idea that it&#8217;s like being a ghost, floating around going through things.  This idea could be true to some extent, but you&#8217;ll be very disappointed if you think you can just get up and do whatever you want once you leave your body.  Once you leave your body, motion, sight, logic, memory, and other basic functions need to be re-learned.  I&#8217;ve been having OBEs for 8 years and I still can&#8217;t move around freely every time.</p>
<p>Other people might argue that OBEs are a form of hallucination or dream.  After all - a lot of OBE techniques focus on going to sleep and messing around with altered states of consciousness.  It seems like a logical explanation on the surface.  However, just like the ghost explanation, it&#8217;s an oversimplification.  It&#8217;s true that during an OBE you will probably experience hallucinations of some sort&#8230; there have been OBEs where I perceived my environment completely wrong.  Garages in the wrong location, outdoor decks that don&#8217;t exist, paint cans that don&#8217;t exist, etc.  But there are also experiences where I&#8217;ve perceived things accurately that I couldn&#8217;t have known otherwise - in my favorite experience, I saw a black plastic washer on the ground.  Upon waking up, I realized it was really a black guitar pick that I had dropped.</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence that OBEs are real to some extent is that during my 8 years, I&#8217;ve always experienced the OBE in the same location as my physical body (<a href="http://www.psipog.net/blog/2006/02/possible-obe.html">except <em>maybe</em> once</a>).  You can&#8217;t say that about dreams.  Nearly all dreams are in foreign locations, like schools, malls, fields, etc.</p>
<p>My point is that OBEs are weird :-).  I hate when people try to simplify it without having personal experience or doing any research.  It&#8217;s like being a ghost, but it&#8217;s not that simple.  Some parts seem like hallucinations, but it&#8217;s not that simple.  So whatever your opinion is, please be aware that this is not an easy thing to explain, and if you find yourself simplifying it in your mind, the most likely reason for that is that you haven&#8217;t researched it enough, and/or you&#8217;ve never had one.</p>
<h3>Strong Desire Method</h3>
<p>There are an unlimited number of techniques to achieve an OBE.  There isn&#8217;t one set way to do it.  Here is one method that I&#8217;ve had success with:</p>
<p>Have a burning desire and unhealthy obsession with wanting to leave your body.  Want it more than you&#8217;ve ever wanted anything else in the world.  If you can achieve that level of emotion, then you&#8217;ll have one.</p>
<p>Now why does this work?  Perhaps you want it so much that you brainwash yourself into having one?!  That&#8217;s not good!  Well, relax for a second :-).  I&#8217;ll explain why this works, and then maybe you can understand the sort of &#8220;desire&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about.  I&#8217;m not talking about the &#8220;self-delusion desire&#8221;.  I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;every level of being desire&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason this method works is because the gateway to an OBE is in an altered state of consciousness.  When you&#8217;re in an altered state of consciousness, you think differently.  You make different decisions.  Logic functions differently.  Memory functions differently.  Emotion is different.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced this.  Has your alarm clock ever woken you up?  You hit the snooze, laying in bed.  The night before you decided to wake up at 6am to go for an early run, but now that you&#8217;re in your comfy warm bed, that logic simply doesn&#8217;t make any sense.  Who cares about exercising?  Screw that.  More sleep.</p>
<p>When you were awake and alert the night before, you made a simple decision: get up early and exercise.  Makes sense to me.  But when you were in a groggy state of mind, a different part of yourself made the decision to stay in bed.  If you think back to the exact moment you made your groggy decision, you can see how your mind functioned very differently.</p>
<p>The burning desire is necessary to overcome this.  If every fiber of your being wants to have an OBE, then when you get into an altered state of consciousness, that altered decision making process will still want an OBE.  This is <em>extremely </em>important.  There are states of mind where it&#8217;s almost a completely subconscious decision.  If you really want to have an OBE that&#8217;s great.  But if your subconscious fears or desires are screaming &#8220;No way!&#8221;, then when you hit that altered state of consciousness, you will resist having an OBE.</p>
<p>To understand this method, simply understand that when you&#8217;re in an altered state of consciousness, you make different decisions.  It&#8217;s that simple.   As another example&#8230; have you ever had a weird dream?  Of course!  One of my dreams today consisted of me making sure no one contaminated the ingredients to a juice maker.  Some guy was being a jerk and messing around with the equipment, and it was my job to get him out of there, so the juice would be free from contamination.  Now that I&#8217;m awake, I see how silly the entire situation is.  But at the time, I was in an altered state of consciousness, and my decision making process was completely different.  My memory was different.  My emotion was different.</p>
<p>Had I had a burning desire to leave my body, then even the part of myself that felt it was necessary to guard a juice maker would have wanted to leave.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion&#8230;</h3>
<p>OBEs are weird.  We might be tempted to explain them using simple ideas, but we should remind ourselves that reality isn&#8217;t as simple as our beliefs would like reality to be.  Research and personal experience can keep us rooted in reality.</p>
<p>One method to leave our body is to have a strong desire on every level of our being.  The reason this works is because we need to make the decision to leave our body while in an altered state of consciousness.  We&#8217;ve already seen in our past experiences how an altered state of consciousness usually makes strange decisions.  Having a burning desire to leave our body will ensure that even our altered decision making will point us in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

					<p>You&#8217;ll have to forgive me.</p>
<p>I was lying in bed, about to fall asleep, when suddenly a bolt of lightning struck me.</p>
<p>My subconscious made a comment to me.  A very calm and seemingly innocent comment.  Perhaps I&#8217;m just insane :-).  That&#8217;s a much more comforting explanation at this point, it seems :-).</p>
<p>My subconscious revealed the metaphor guiding me these past months.  And now I can come to no other conclusion than this reality is a form of dream.  This idea is so overplayed in religion that it leaves a bad taste on my mouth to say it, but now I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> it with my eyes&#8230; so I have no other choice but to admit it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Ok whoa whoa whoa.  Hehehe.  I am insane :-).  Or maybe I just mind-fucked myself.  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>There is a deeper meaning behind our personal realities.  Everything <em>does</em> happen for a reason.</p>
<p>Look&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to go into the realization I made, because it&#8217;s pretty personal, and I don&#8217;t feel like spilling my heart all over the internet for everyone to see :-P.  I mean, I like you guys and everything, but not that much :-P.  But I can break it down from another perspective that is understandable, now that I have some hindsight.</p>
<p>When I say that &#8220;reality is a form of dream&#8221;, what I&#8217;m talking about is how dreams have deeper meaning when looked at from a metaphorical perspective.  So does this reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very interesting to analyze your own dreams and see how things manifest.  For example, dreaming of taking a shit can represent unloading emotional waste that&#8217;s built up inside of yourself, and be a sign of growth and psychological cleansing.  So in real life, perhaps you are dealing with old problems that you feel need to be taken care of for you to move on, and tying up loose ends.  As a result, one night you dream of taking a massive shit in a bathroom.  You wake up thinking, &#8220;Now where did that come from?  Very bizarre!&#8221;  But there is an underlying meaning.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.</p>
<p>So, what I&#8217;m saying is that this reality also has this same <em>exact</em> sort of deeper meaning.  What we manifest in this reality is a reflection of who we are and what we are dealing with - just like in dreams.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  This is what intention manifestation tries to talk about (but fails, I believe).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that this reality uses the <em>exact same</em> metaphor function that dreams use.  The exact same function.  This is why this reality is a form of dream.  This is also why intention manifestation actually produces results.  It hijacks and focuses this metaphorical function of reality to produce an outcome.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m explaining this correctly or not.  Maybe I&#8217;m not giving enough examples.  Let me try again.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re walking outside, what do you do if it suddenly starts to rain?  Do you run for shelter?  Do you pause and enjoy the sprinkles?  Depending on your personal reality, this reaction means different things.  If you run for shelter, perhaps you do this because you feel you need to run from your problems.  Other problems you experience in life, you run from.  Do you curse the weather?  This might mean you feel you&#8217;re being treated unjustly by &#8220;God&#8221;.  The weather could represent a system that is out of man&#8217;s control, and therefore only under the control of &#8220;God&#8221;.  If it rains on you, you feel that &#8220;God&#8221; is unjustly making your life miserable, so you curse the rain.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  Do you see how this is the same function as dreaming as well?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all connected.  All the ideas in your head, all the beliefs you hold, all the emotions you feel, all the experiences you have in this reality&#8230; it&#8217;s all connected.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that if you run from the rain, that you run from your problems.  It depends on who you are as a person.  Just like your dreams&#8230; if you dream about being in the bathroom, it might represent a time period where you need to do some psychological cleansing.  But if you are a janitor for a living, then the idea of being in a bathroom would have a completely different meaning to you, since you probably clean a lot of bathrooms for a living.  Perhaps it means it&#8217;s time to clean up someone else&#8217;s mess?</p>
<p>Ok&#8230; so anyways.  The important part about this is that reality does this.  The experiences you&#8217;ve had in your life have meaning.  They happened for a reason.  Think of it like a dream.  What is the metaphor?  What does it emotionally mean to you?  Decode it like you would decode waking up from a bizarre dream.</p>
<p>Now I really do need to get to sleep.  This realization has interrupted me :-P.  I&#8217;ll probably read this in the morning and face-palm :-P.</p>

				<div class="entry" id="entry_39">
					<p>I&#8217;ve read this book twice in the past month: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/As-Man-Thinketh-James-Allen/dp/1557423601/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3226097-7024607?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182784797&amp;sr=8-1"><em>As a Man Thinketh</em></a>, by James Allen, published in 1902.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a short book - the version I have is 52 pages long.  But it&#8217;s a great read.  Here are some quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have appeared without them.  This applies equally to those acts called &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; and &#8220;unpremeditated&#8221; as to those which are deliberately executed.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires.  Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power.  Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound.  The man who does not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object upon which his heart is set.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life.  And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The universe does not favor the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious, although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous.  All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Tempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever conditions ye may live, know this - in the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming.  Keep you hand firmly upon the helm of thought.  In the bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; He does but sleep; wake Him.  Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power.  Say unto your heart, &#8220;Peace, be still!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The entire book is like that.  I like it!</p>

				<div class="entry" id="entry_37">
					<p>First off - thanks for everyone&#8217;s comments.  You guys present views that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see otherwise, and it helps.</p>
<p>Let me summarize my previous post, now that I&#8217;ve had time to digest everything.</p>
<p>Intention manifestation is slightly flawed.  It&#8217;s a good model overall, but there is a problem.  The problem is that we believe that a &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; <em>causes</em> our intention to manifest.  Because of that belief, we design our exercises in ways to induce this &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; within us.  This is incorrect (although it can produce some limited results).</p>
<p>I believe intention manifestation made this problem because it saw that successful people had a &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; before they succeeded, so we assumed this &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; causes the success.  This is a logical fallacy, called <a href="http://skepdic.com/posthoc.html">Post Hoc</a>.  Just because it came before doesn&#8217;t mean that it caused it.</p>
<p>One way to explain this is that something happened before the &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; came.  This something caused the &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;, and it also caused the success.  Another way to explain it is that something happened before the success, and we have a precognitive facility that sees the success happening, which causes the &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  There could be a million explanations, these are just two alternatives.  Here&#8217;s a picture:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/06/alternateideas.png" alt="Alternate Ideas to Intention Manifestation" /></p>
<p>It is my current understanding that both alternate 1 and alternate 2 could be true at the same time, and that &#8220;something&#8221; is choice.</p>
<p>Now, I can dance around in the theoretical mind junk mumbo jumbo all I want&#8230; what actual changes are made with this altered perspective?</p>
<p>With intention manifestation, our goal is to induce the &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  We can do that with visualization, altering our beliefs, feeling the success, etc.  All our techniques stem from inducing a &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  With the alternate ideas, our goal changes&#8230; now we need to figure out what that &#8220;something&#8221; is, and how to do it.</p>
<p>But all hope is not lost.  It seems we might have more work to do, but not really.  We have a pretty good hint - when we do that &#8220;something&#8221; correctly, we should experience a &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  Not FORCING it.  We should naturally experience it.</p>
<p>So my new technique for winning the lottery has changed.  Instead of repeating mantras in my mind about how I&#8217;ve won, I&#8217;m going to instead alter my number picking strategy.  I tried this strategy on the last drawing and had minimal success (nothing crazy or definite).  My new strategy is to write down numbers, and see if I feel a &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; about them.  When I focus on them, do I feel that the numbers are winners?  Do I feel confident?  Am I sure they will win?</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t feel that confidence, then I tweak the numbers, and try again.  And again.  And again.  Until I feel I&#8217;ve optimized my &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  Then I play those numbers.</p>
<p>I will try this new strategy for a month or two, and see how it goes.</p>
