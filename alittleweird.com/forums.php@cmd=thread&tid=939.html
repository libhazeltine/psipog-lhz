<br />
Having practiced pk on already recorded videos, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that time really is pretty abstract in nature.<br />
<br />
It happens pretty often that subconscious notifies me of something that&#039;s about to happen in a few seconds. There have also been a few childhood dreams of places that I have recognized just recently because they didn&#039;t exist before.<br />
<br />
Have you noticed that the more you practice pk, the more you&#039;ll remember having practiced pk as a child. Events you never thought had happened .. as if living the past, present and future at the same time.<br />
<br />
Have fun enjoying unity ;-)</div>

		<div id="post_16564" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hmm, you&#039;re probably right.<br />
A single thought or emotion seems to have a pretty strong effect on reality.<br />
<br />
Though, I think it&#039;s the same with people who don&#039;t practice. It&#039;s just that they usually kill the constructs they have formed with previous thoughts (a little bit of doubt seems to be enough for this).<br />

Hmm, you&#039;re probably right.<br />
A single thought or emotion seems to have a pretty strong effect on reality.</div>Right, the only reason why you don&#039;t see your thought having any effect is, because you yourself are thinking yourself a lot of things at the same time, which makes this one thought pretty small and you don&#039;t recongnize the small difference.<br />
Another reason would also be collective consciousness. Thats why levitating is so hard ^^, because everyone knows about gravity and thinks it is absolute. 1 against 6-7 billion is a bit unfair ^^<br />
