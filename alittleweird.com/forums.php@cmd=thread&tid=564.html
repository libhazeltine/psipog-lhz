		<div id="post_11381" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">As many of you may know there is a large hadron collider in Switzerland, which speeds up particles and smashes protons together at great speeds.  it has been hypothesised that in doing this a number of things could happen.  one of which is that a black hole could be created.  as we know a black hole is not a good thing to have on earth.  they are turning this on tomorrow for the first time, though im not completely sure if they are attempting to smash protons yet, or in october.  <br />
<br />
Firstly i just wanted to get your opinions on the hadron collider, and secondly i was thinking it wouldnt hurt as a proportion to maybe get everyone who can to make constructs around it, programmed to close a black hole. now theres no guareentee that, that will actually stop one, and keeping in mind that a black hole is only one of many things that could potentially happen one may not even open.  But its better to attempt to stop the end of the world than just sitting by and watching it happen. (though watching is probably the wrong term, as it would happen so fast no one would ever know).</div>

		<div id="post_11384" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Um, I thought black holes don&#039;t really have any shape or volume. In my science class my teacher taught me that a black hole is a point in space, that point is created because a planet is collapsed from its enormous gravity. And it just keep sink in until a black hole is formed, that&#039;s how i understood it. So black hole is just a single point, that point will still suck in anything around it because of its gravity.<br />
<br />
I did read the article relating to microscopic black holes by force master, for those who don&#039;t feel like reading the article I&#039;ll put it in my words...its a very very small black hole with very very weak gravity so it can&#039;t really influence big objects, basically very small effects, and the possibility for one that&#039;s strong enough to effect planets is close to 0. Also just to add they also say that it&#039;s very hard for a microscopic black hole to sustain itself...anyways, not that much harm.<br />
<br />
Well, I don&#039;t think anyone would agree to the project in Switz if that would mean the end of the world. The researchers would know better than to end the world(not saying its not possible, they could be a bunch of psychos who wanted to take over the world by threatening people with that LOL, or just desperate people, or emo) , but most likely, the &quot;black hole&quot; won&#039;t be dangerous. It&#039;s only a hypothesis after all...<br />

<strike>Note: I&#039;m not saying its impossible that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #CC0000;"><strong>we&#039;ll all die</strong></span></span> at all, if its the end of the world I better go eat all the chips right now...</strike><br />

Um, I thought black holes don&#039;t really have any shape or volume. In my science class my teacher taught me that a black hole is a point in space, that point is created because a planet is collapsed from its enormous gravity. And it just keep sink in until a black hole is formed, that&#039;s how i understood it. So black hole is just a single point, that point will still suck in anything around it because of its gravity.</div>You are not entirely correct. A black hole is formed when a star not a planet collapses in on itself.<br />
<br />
here is how it happens:<br />
<br />
As a star reaches the end of its life and fuses all of its elements it begins to expand. if the mass of the star is close to or less then the mass of our sun then the star colapses but because the mass is not great enough to over come the electron degeneracy (the force it takes to press electrons extrememly close together) the star then rebounds creating a super-nova.<br />
<br />
Now if the mass of the star is 1.3-3 times the mass of the sun then when the star colapses at the end it overcomes this electron degeneracy (able to compress electrons so they are extremely close together) but is not able to overcome the neutron degeneracy hence a neutron star is formed. These are extremely dense and extremely small.<br />
<br />
NOW if the mass of the star is 3.1 times or more than the mass of our sun the collapse of the star is so great it overcomes the electron AND the neutron degeneracy after this there is nothing to stop it so now it collapses in on itself forever and ever.<br />
<br />
The black hole itself is a single point with ZERO volume and infinite density.<br />
<br />
what people dont understand is that black holes dont &quot;suck&quot; anything into them. merely when things come into range they &quot;fall&quot; into the singularity.<br />
<br />
Another thing people don&#039;t understand is that the event horizon (the point of no return) from the black hole is quite small. There is an equation called the Schwarzschild radius that shows the correlation between the mass of black hole and how large its event horizon is.<br />
<br />
In the case of the smallest black hole POSSIBLE the mass of the black hole HAS to be AT LEAST 3.1 times the mass of our sun or there is no way it can overcome the degeneracies to colapse in on itself to form itself. <br />
<br />
The Schwarzschild radius of the smallest black hole possible is about is equated out to be 10 kilometers. YES KILOMETERS. it is much tinier than you think.<br />
<br />
thats means you can come within 10 kilometers of a black hole whose mass is 3.1 times the mass of our sun and still be able to escape from it no problem. BUT once you cross that line, that event horizon,  NOTHING can escape. not even light because the escape velocity from within the event horizon is GREATER than the speed of light. and nothing can move faster than that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IN SHORT IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO READ MY WALL OF TEXT ( i dont blame you):<br />
<br />
Micro black holes are an oxymoron and are physically impossible.<br />
<br />
dont worry about it<br />
