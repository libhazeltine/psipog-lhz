		<div id="post_9810" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Sean, you claim that when it comes to IM, you can easily influence people and thus events using it. My question is, if your ultimate goal is to have enough financial security to do what you want, why don&#039;t you use IM to help you build the necessary financial wealth? After all, you seem like you&#039;re pretty great at IM already.<br />
<br />
The lottery can still be a side project, but it seems like using the skill you already have would be an effective step towards your ultimate goal...<br />
<br />
To everyone else in here - do you practice any of the Law of Attraction/intention manifestation teachings? If so, how much do you notice emotion having an effect on your results? In a lot of LoA books, emotions are seen as critical to the attraction process but that has not been true in my experience. Being in an every-day calm sort of state seems to harness the best results.</div>

		<div id="post_9823" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;m not worried about financial independence so much.  I started investing in the stock market, and can use my very small precog skills to earn money.  Plus I know I can always use IM, like you said.  I feel confident that I&#039;ll be very wealthy some day.<br />
<br />
The lottery interests me for two reasons: 1. it&#039;s instant.  And 2. it&#039;s a pure &quot;random&quot; process.  It has no human interaction.  If I can win the lottery, then that will tell me a lot more about reality than just using precog or IM to be financially independent.<br />
<br />
So... the lottery interests me because it is a direct relationship between ME and REALITY.  Where as other means of creating wealth will interface with humans.  Which I have nothing against!  It&#039;s just not as interesting to me :-).<br />

But what if the general rule is that the world IS random, but because of human conscious/desires/thoughts/emotions, the &#039;random&#039; aspect becomes influenced and thus less random? Which would mean even if you do win the lottery, it doesn&#039;t prove that the world isn&#039;t random - it would just prove that the inherent randomness in the world can be influenced. This isn&#039;t a topic I&#039;ve thought about too much so I&#039;d like to hear what you think :-P Maybe there&#039;s an error in my thinking.<br />
<br />
Also, what do you think about the whole emotion aspect when it comes to IM? Has it been extremely important in your experience with LoA.<br />

		<div id="post_9862" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Sean, has it come to your mind yet that desire may be like a mirror to will power, and that it&#039;s possible that the more desire you put forth into this matter, the more influence will be against you? <br />
<br />
Just some food for thought...<br />
<br />
EDIT: If I were to think of it like a static charge, the lottery numbers are all being pumped up with negative charge (desire)... Without the influence of something with a positive charge (the opposite of desire), one would expect that the natural flow of energy would try to balance things out and pick the numbers with the least amount of desire.<br />
<br />
Now, add the effect opposite of desire and what will they do? If this form of logic is correct, you should end up attracting the numbers you desire most.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a complicated process... but it may work out ^.^</div>
