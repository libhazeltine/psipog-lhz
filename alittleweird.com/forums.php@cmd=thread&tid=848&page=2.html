On a different note, I and my friend are finally starting to get the hang of telepathy, but I was wondering about something. In one case, I was able to correctly figure out one of my partner&#039;s thoughts, but it came to be in a completely different way than how he sent it. Is it because my subconscious percieved his thoughts as something slightly different (but with the same idea behind it) or did I just make a lucky guess?</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

In my opinion, using a lot of constructs should help you to move something heavier. However, all of those constructs need to have their own energy source and they all have to be concentrated on moving that single object in one direction.<br />

@Jacob: <br />
Maybe moving an object telekinetically actually doesn&#039;t depend on psi pressure; maybe it&#039;s just that we are in the wrong mindset and using techniques that depend on the psi pressure?<br />

IMO, a construct simply a device that does things for you, not a completely separate entity.  This would explain why a construct can&#039;t exceed your skill in whatever it has to do.  In other words, instead of you focusing on the thing to be moved, it does and feeds off your skill.  <br />
