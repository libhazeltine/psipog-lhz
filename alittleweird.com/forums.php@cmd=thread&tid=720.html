One of my colleagues, believes that his life was being tampered with by a demon, or entity, I decided to find out for myself by using psionics/telepathy; the reason for that is because my telepathy technique differs from some others. it involves a mixture of remote viewing and remote presence/bylocation; I find the person and get a feel of their aura before creating a link<br />
<br />
I used that technique to find a link between my colleague and any entity of an evil nature, and to my surprise found something, its aura was very strong, it was as if the entity or demon radiated fear, in its presence I felt my blood flowing through my veins, with each heartbeat getting colder, colder and colder. This sort of fear I had never felt in my life, so I broke away.<br />

But that is getting off topic, I too have wondered about spirits and demons, maybe the a spirit is a combination of soul and mind. Not sure about demons, maybe entities brought forth by the collective thoughts of a group of people, kinda like a tulpa.</div>
