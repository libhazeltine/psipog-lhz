I started practicing again the same day this thread started.<br />
<br />
I guess that means you can count me in too,  although for the record; I think things should be more structured than before.<br />
<br />
From my perspective, the reason people peter out is because they don&#039;t know what to do next, or they&#039;re unsure if anything is actually happening.   And I&#039;d say its also the main reason people don&#039;t post or contribute..   They need guidance, not information.<br />
<br />
We also can&#039;t force people to come to a chat room every week unless its something they&#039;re actually interested in..  Like say, for example, keeping the psionic community alive.   If we go off on every topic under the sun and invite everyone, sooner or later they&#039;ll stop showing up.<br />
<br />
If anything we need structured classes on specific days and times, and given grades.<br />
We need to make a school, and like a school, we should have the right to hold you back if you can&#039;t or wont learn.<br />
Sure its a little rougher than what people would want, namely 13 year old DragonBall Z fanboys..   But if the people learning are actually hungry for it, its the best thing in the world for them.<br />
<br />
Think about it, each session would speak on the topic, give projects to work on both by yourself and with others, you get homework;  its everything about a trade school except with a touch of the paranormal.<br />
<br />
Sure, it&#039;d be a lot of work, both I&#039;m sure at least some of you are willing to put up with it for the betterment of psionics, am I right?<br />

<br />
Well, to sum it all up;<br />
I propose a psion school.</div>

What I would see is some sort of mentor system. People who are skilled in a discipline volunteer to be a mentor to someone who wants to learn the discipline.
The would-be mentor would of course be interviewed to verify that they are not some random jackass. That&#039;d help us breach the time zones and yet insure that no one is above anyone, just willingly teaching and learning.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

<br />
I suppose something like that though can be worked out later. I think that we hold out on making a forum right away. I think we should start with an IRC chat, and spend some time organizing everything. We&#039;ll want to find a few practicing psions willing to help out and work out how this &quot;School&quot; will work.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I propose a 2-tier plan. After we have established everything mentioned in the previous paragraph, we can start holding &quot;communal&quot; classes, where it&#039;s more or less everyone joining in to listen to lectures or discuss other things. The goal of this tier is to start forming a base community and determining who will do what - if we want to be a realistic school we&#039;ll probably want one individual teacher for every &quot;subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
After this, the forum will be created. Classes will then be held according to subject with a large group of people in every class. Perhaps we can pick out those who are already familiar with psionic phenomena and put them in an AP class, with the goal being to help them refine their skills more quickly. In either case, once students &quot;graduate,&quot; they can be given the option of becoming teachers themselves. In time, we should have enough teachers to instate a more personal one-on-one mentoring system.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Criticism? There are definitely a few wrinkles to work out - mainly where we&#039;re going to get enough skilled psychics - this is just a rough proposal.</div>

		<div id="post_15821" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">But a mentor system would end up like it did on Veritas. Too many willing students and not enough mentors. The tough part would basically be the beginning. If we have grades and sort of &quot;ranks&quot; (EX: Beginning student/Intermediate student/Advanced student/Teacher) we could have a good few mentors after a small amount of students advance and can teach others. You don&#039;t necessarily need to be a teacher to teach; think of schools&#039; tutoring systems. The students who&#039;ve been judged by competent teachers as good enough to teach others and who&#039;re more advanced than the level of student they teach become mentors and help the newer students advance. With that system, we could get intermediate and advanced students to do their part, not only the teachers.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, the beginning would be the tough part, since we&#039;d only have teachers and beginning students... But as soon as the teachers judge some students good enough to teach newer ones, you&#039;ve got something interesting going.<br />
<br />
Just like the would-be teachers having to be first thoroughly interviewed to become actual teachers, the students willing to go about a tutoring program have to first be interviewed by teachers.<br />
<br />
Let me add one more suggestion, though: To keep away the fluff, trolling, spamming, etc. The membership should be controlled. I suggest interviewing those who want to be members. When someone registers an account, you don&#039;t unlock it immediately; you set up a private IRC room and interview them at a designated time. If not, you&#039;ll get hundreds of people asking &quot;lol how do i fireball? =D&quot; and everyone&#039;s hard work in creating a quality community for those willing to learn will have been pointless.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Next time I&#039;ll refresh and check the new replies before writing mine XD I&#039;m with Trick on this one: A forum would be more useful than chats to deal with time zones and all... Here&#039;s something: Give the classes live in a chat room, but save them in an organized fashion on the forums so others can come along and ask questions after if they didn&#039;t get to follow the class.</div>

<br />
The problem I&#039;ve consistently ran into is lack of people willing to do the actual WORK (examples outlined here:  <a href="2007/11/14/i-dont-miss-psipog/index.html" target="_blank">http://alittleweird.com/2007/11/14/i-dont-miss-psipog/</a> ).  There&#039;s a lot of work that goes into maintaining a community, along with providing useful and relevant information.  It&#039;s not just &quot;launch a website+forum+chat, and everything else is just details&quot;.  It&#039;s work.  It takes time, effort, money, compromise, motivation, endurance, planning, luck, marketing, flexibility, technical knowledge, politics, etc.<br />
<br />
And unless you&#039;re hiring, you are asking people to volunteer their free time.  People have lives... people have school, jobs, social lives, other hobbies... it&#039;s hard to put aside time to work on these things.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying these things to discourage you guys, or anything like that.  I would really love for a healthy productive community to be born.  Perhaps you can learn from the difficulties I&#039;ve encountered, and find solutions.  Best of luck.<br />
