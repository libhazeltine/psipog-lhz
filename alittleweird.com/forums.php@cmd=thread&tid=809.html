<br />
My experience with psionics is very short, and i barely have any consistency to practice, but i do know my capabilities are plentiful, and i&#039;ve assured myself in the existence of psi energies as i once disrupted one of the back lights of a passing car in a fit of anger, accidentally creating a psi projectile and aimed it with my umbrella that i carried with me at the time.<br />
<br />
Despite such, i haven&#039;t actually gotten any practice time in, i just live a very weird lifestyle. However, my interest has picked up as of recent, and i was wondering if someone could answer a question of mine.<br />
<br />
The question is, how easy would it be to manipulate psi energy to improve certain mental qualities? I&#039;ve never been fond of how slow my reaction time to everything around me, is. It&#039;s especially frustrating if i&#039;m talked into a game of cards that require a very quick reacting speed. I always lose, because i&#039;m so darned slow.<br />
<br />
Any tips, suggestions, pointers?</div>

Just a quit story to go with this. :P<br />

My coach was trying to train all of our reaction times to be faster. I&#039;d been meditating for a few years at that point, so mine was pretty damn slow. He would throw a ball under our legs, it would bounce off the wall in a random direction at us, and we&#039;d have to catch it. Everybody else cought the ball fine. When it came my turn, we tried multiple times. But I would never catch it, I never came close. Everybody literally thought I might have been high. :P</div>

Are you sure those studies are correct? All of the studies that I have read seemed to indicate that meditation brings vast improvements to both mental and physical health and performance, not just psionics. In fact, now that I think about, in a paper that I did on meditation I referenced a study that showed that reaction speed <em>increased</em> for those who practiced meditation over those who didn&#039;t.<br />

Maybe focus and intention are the differences. If the goal of the meditation is to improve reaction time and such, perhaps the outcome will favor these areas, rather than psionics.</div>

While we&#039;re on the topic of side effects of meditation, it will also temporarily decrease your metabolism while you do it. Not a big deal, just a slight bit of extra effort (not really even a noticable amount) and you should be right back up. </div>

The one I&#039;ve been practicing now has already decreased my time in reactions, like one case that came to my mind right now. I was once holding a remote controller in my hand, and it started to drop but before it even left my hand I caught it. So, I really think reaction times do decrease not increase. I&#039;ve been doing sports for my &quot;whole life&quot;, and have had all the time good reaction times, but after I started to meditate they&#039;ve decreased a lot. Might be some differences between techniques then?</div>

Hi everyone, i&#039;m new, sorta. Been lurking around for a while. I see there&#039;s some activity here, so i figured i might jump the bandwagon too.<br />
<br />
My experience with psionics is very short, and i barely have any consistency to practice, but i do know my capabilities are plentiful, and i&#039;ve assured myself in the existence of psi energies as i once disrupted one of the back lights of a passing car in a fit of anger, accidentally creating a psi projectile and aimed it with my umbrella that i carried with me at the time.<br />
<br />
Despite such, i haven&#039;t actually gotten any practice time in, i just live a very weird lifestyle. However, my interest has picked up as of recent, and i was wondering if someone could answer a question of mine.<br />
<br />
The question is, how easy would it be to manipulate psi energy to improve certain mental qualities? I&#039;ve never been fond of how slow my reaction time to everything around me, is. It&#039;s especially frustrating if i&#039;m talked into a game of cards that require a very quick reacting speed. I always lose, because i&#039;m so darned slow.<br />
<br />
Any tips, suggestions, pointers?</div>corruptedlifestream@gmail.com<br />

If its a faster reaction time your looking for, psionics isnt for you. Studies show meditation slows down reaction times. Meditators have slower reflexes than those who dont. If your going to practice psionics, meditation is a must. <br />
<br />
Just a quit story to go with this. :P<br />
<br />
My coach was trying to train all of our reaction times to be faster. I&#039;d been meditating for a few years at that point, so mine was pretty damn slow. He would throw a ball under our legs, it would bounce off the wall in a random direction at us, and we&#039;d have to catch it. Everybody else cought the ball fine. When it came my turn, we tried multiple times. But I would never catch it, I never came close. Everybody literally thought I might have been high. :P</div>A friend of mine meditate&#039;s 5-6 hours a day, and I can&#039;t say he&#039;s slower then I am. Also it is wrong to believe that meditation is a psionics subject. its completely 2 different things.<br />
<br />
I believe that what studies have shown can be true, perhaps it has to do with the type of people that meditate. On the other hand you can&#039;t say that shaolin monks are particularly slow people.<br />

Slower reaction time isnt a huge deal or anything. Its only by about half a second.</div>I did reaction time tests on the internet I would usually come to around 0.20 or 0.25 second... That means that if I would be a fanatic meditator my reaction time is about 3 times slower.<br />

Wich I think is insane.</div>
