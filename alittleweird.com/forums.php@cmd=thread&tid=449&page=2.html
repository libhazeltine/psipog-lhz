I also see that meditation is most free forms would work as well. It is rumored that monks(just people is pretty much the same, but monks are more dedicated) studied in Buddhism meditates every single day(the meditate part is all true, I have a family believing in Buddhism, I&#039;m pretty much undetermined, but still knows about Buddhism), for a long time...Some are rumored to have the powers of a person who practiced with psi for years of experience.Note:they have empathy, shields, telepathy, and other unexplainable powers(perhaps relating to electro, pyro, and tele, kinesis). I pretty much believe this since I have come in contact with monks often. And so I assume that meditate is just as important as training itself.(I&#039;m rash so I get bored, I don&#039;t meditate much, can&#039;t really say I like to meditate, so little time in the world, I meditate during my free time).<br />

But I do realize that meditation is very nice and it is important.</div>

		<div id="post_11302" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">But, honestly everyone, what is the purpose of this Psionics? I know we are think its cool and stuff, but is there more things to just moves things with our mind? The world is really misguided at this age, just about everyone is skeptical, even if they DO believe, maybe they don&#039;t care? What is the point even if they did care?<br />
<br />
<br />
I never used to believe in anything weird unless I see it with my own eyes, feel it, and just to make sure 100%. that might be the way most people are now, is that the way people are supposed to be like? Life itself is not just life, I feel that I can keep myself busy doing things all day, does that keep me fulfilled? Sure, if everyone is happy with what I am doing I might feel happy as well, or is that just a illusion? <br />
<br />
<br />
I feel the world is separating from me, and I try to be unique from everyone else, to stand out, though some might just think its dumb. But I have my own ideas on things that&#039;s just different from others. Is it right to stand out like that? Because everything are supposed to be with the flow, if you stick out you will get picked on. I feel that&#039;s the way of things go, yet I also have a contradicting view in my mind. I don&#039;t want to separate from the world, and my mind is confusing me.<br />
<br />
<br />
There could be multiple thoughts in my mind. It might be weird but there are different opinions on me that can always effect me. Maybe five minds that I can just feel. Its like the angle and the devil appear on someone&#039;s shoulders when they should to make a decision. for me, my mind just take over completely. At times I feel no control at all, maybe I don&#039;t really want to be in control, just knowing whatever feels good...and do it<br />
<br />
What does meditate REALLY do for you? I know it &quot;charges&quot; our energy, but is that another thing that is deeper that that? The morals of things will never change. That will forever stay with people&#039;s conscious, then meditation should help you so the morals actually sink in with you. If it can change you spiritually, then why wouldn&#039;t meditation effect your consciousness in a positive way?<br />
<br />
<br />
I always dreamed at night, but was never in charge for any of them, and some dreams don&#039;t even sink into my brain so I would even have a clue that I dreamed at all, though I just have a &quot;feeling&quot; that I dreamed something, don&#039;t know what. Many times I realize myself in the dream realm, I always wake up after that, no matter how much I wanted to say. Maybe I just forced myself to wake up. I can recall me doing immoral things in the dream realm, feels so unlike me, I steal, rape, kill, do any and everything...Is that who I really am in my sub-conscious mind? Or is that just a warning for &quot;what no to do&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind is tricky, for me it is hard to control. How can I fail even to read my own mind? That is the way it is, my true feelings for things are usually never revealed after certain experiences in life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Motivation-what motivates us, and is there really a point in terms with the motivation? I always told myself that I motivate myself only because so many people who cared about me wished me to do this for my own good. I always believed, or tried to convince myself whatever I do is for the good of the society as a whole, or will be in the future. I wanted to contribute. Maybe that is a lie, because I also cared for myself, the most. I&#039;m only trying to hide how selfish I really am, and nothing else, when I realized this I still kept lying to myself, tricking myself to whatever leads to me next.<br />
<br />
<br />
pushing hard to achieve a goal-I personally experienced and seen many people, filled with excitement, knowing they will achieve and work hard towards a goal...nothing really changed after the excitement wears off. Is it because a goal can not be instantly accepted by your mind, or your mind just don&#039;t care for it? These are just excuses, you just DON&#039;T WANT TO DO IT. It&#039;s too much work. If the job is to sleep 12 hours a day and you get paid $200 a hour, you probably will do it(unless you are Bill Gates or the other guy who&#039;s super rich, or just don&#039;t care about $$).<br />
<br />
<br />
Money-money, items, and all the worldly desires seemed so dearly to me, but I kept telling my self that everything is not real. But that will mean that I am not real. Are we real? The universe itself is infinitely big, who are we in comparison of the universe itself? Why are we alive? That was my question when I was in 2nd grade...I don&#039;t see why, since we seemed so insignificant. But everything happens for a reason, thus we all influence the universe in a way(Someone used this idea), why does really matter in this universe? what makes things happen? Is it god? I refuses to believe, I believe that everyone in the universe created the way universe are, just like how time started, mysteriously... Then everything we own are just illusions, since they don&#039;t really worth anything in a spiritual way. What does matter then? a better question, what matters more? the physical world or the spiritual world? We must alter the physical world in our minds first to enter the spiritual world, and the existence of the spiritual world I can only describe so abstractly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well this is kinda off topic, filled with mistakes, and boring, try not fell asleep reading it, or just skip it =p.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I never did anything as bad as rape or kill in my dreams...just to say I&#039;m not a horrible person, but I know I&#039;m capable of doing such matters, since in dreams you can feel as if there is no consequences at times.</div>

You decide what is right or wrong. You decide how to act. Although you say &quot;I try to be unique&quot; I don&#039;t really agree with. Don&#039;t try to be anything you are not. Just be yourself. <br />

Money-money, items, and all the worldly desires seemed so dearly to me, but I kept telling my self that everything is not real. But that will mean that I am not real. Are we real? The universe itself is infinitely big, who are we in comparison of the universe itself? Why are we alive? That was my question when I was in 2nd grade...I don&#039;t see why, since we seemed so insignificant. But everything happens for a reason, thus we all influence the universe in a way(Someone used this idea), why does really matter in this universe? what makes things happen? Is it god? I refuses to believe, I believe that everyone in the universe created the way universe are, just like how time started, mysteriously... Then everything we own are just illusions, since they don&#039;t really worth anything in a spiritual way. What does matter then? a better question, what matters more? the physical world or the spiritual world? We must alter the physical world in our minds first to enter the spiritual world, and the existence of the spiritual world I can only describe so abstractly.</div>I believe these questions are pointless. They are questions that have no true answers, and they won&#039;t do anything for you if you knew the answer. For instance, &quot;Why do we exist?&quot; &quot;We exist in order to destroy God #2&#039;s opposite universe&quot; There is a possible answer that anyone could give you. You don&#039;t really know if it is true or not, but more importantly, so what? Now you know that your universe is to fight your opposite universe. Big deal. That information isn&#039;t really going to help you. So, what I&#039;m trying to say is, don&#039;t bother with questions like that. They just stress you out and waste time. Just watch and enjoy the world, don&#039;t think about it.<br />

You asked a lot of questions...I&#039;m only going to answer the ones I feel like answering. :)

I feel the world is separating from me, and I try to be unique from everyone else, to stand out, though some might just think its dumb. But I have my own ideas on things that&#039;s just different from others. Is it right to stand out like that? Because everything are supposed to be with the flow, if you stick out you will get picked on. I feel that&#039;s the way of things go, yet I also have a contradicting view in my mind. I don&#039;t want to separate from the world, and my mind is confusing me.
[/quote]

I&#039;m not going to say &quot;Yes, it is alright to be different&quot; or &quot;No, it is not alright to be different&quot; because no one should be able to tell you either one of those answers. You decide what is right or wrong. You decide how to act. Although you say &quot;I try to be unique&quot; I don&#039;t really agree with. Don&#039;t try to be anything you are not. Just be yourself. 

[quote][i]posted by jackrivers:[/i]
I always dreamed at night, but was never in charge for any of them, and some dreams don&#039;t even sink into my brain so I would even have a clue that I dreamed at all, though I just have a &quot;feeling&quot; that I dreamed something, don&#039;t know what. Many times I realize myself in the dream realm, I always wake up after that, no matter how much I wanted to say. Maybe I just forced myself to wake up. I can recall me doing immoral things in the dream realm, feels so unlike me, I steal, rape, kill, do any and everything...Is that who I really am in my sub-conscious mind? Or is that just a warning for &quot;what no to do&quot;?[/quote]

Dreams are places with no rules, they are your realms to do anything you want in. You never get to experience any of those &quot;bad&quot; things in reality, so you try to live them in your dreams instead. Some of those things are very appealing, so it&#039;s only natural.

Yes, in many cases happiness is an illusion. Any happiness from entertainment or material objects are considered false, because they only last a moment and you must continuously seek more to keep on trying to become happy.

		<div id="post_11371" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Link, your ideas are very helpful to me. But anyways I want to share how I usually meditate.<br />
<br />
I just sit there, trying to calm down and focus on the awareness of my entire body, eventually I enter a state where I could mostly see whatever I imagine, I can not move freely in that state---(like day dreaming, you have no control), but to others I just look like I&#039;m out(crazy psycho person looking weird), its really about trying to clear my mind, and not letting myself sink into the world of hatred and frustration, I wanted to avoid that world, and I can achieve that by meditation. I try to connect with my feels, and just imagine going deeper and deeper into my mind... I&#039;m not very experienced so this might not be so helpful, I&#039;m just a begginer anyways.<br />
<br />
I usually try to ignore the breathing, but since so many people talked about it I&#039;ll just say that I breathe the way I feel is right, I tighten when I feel I need to, but I make slow breathes to get started so I could calm myself. And its really about how you feel like. I just meditated the way I feel like, not sure if its the best way for me, but it doesn&#039;t feel wrong.<br />
<br />
Honestly I never really felt the need to meditate. However I was told to meditate when I was little(parents are religious), don&#039;t really like it since I don&#039;t feel so calming(it was more of a drag than something I really wanted to do), I felt tiresome doing it so I stopped for a long time. Now I&#039;m getting back to it, not daily but I do it to calm myself. My temper is bad(I usually get really mad inside under lots of pressure, I tend to keep myself calm on the outside and just really try to escape from reality because it was too much to bear, or too much so I cant take it, I don&#039;t want to deal with it because more argument usually come up, making the situation more tense, so I rather just &quot;go away&quot;, and so I don&#039;t really want myself to get mad, its a matter of self control for me), so I could calm myself through meditation at times, or just to relax under stress.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really feel like meditation very comfortably, but not as much as laying on the bed, you tend to roam off when its more comfortable.<br />
<br />
hope this helps. </div>

This is interesting, I feel that I have been on a similar path in my life. Most notably is that ideas around Idealism as well as one of Socrates&#039;s quotes, namely &quot;True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing, that is what makes you the smartest of all.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have come to the conclusion that there are no conclusions... It doesn&#039;t click with many people that this whole world is, in essence, just a compressed and heated mass of chemicals, which are essentially compounds and atoms, which, are in reality, only atoms and atoms effecting other atoms. <br />
<br />
Simply put, the world does not make sense... A force cannot logically exist because reaction should be an impossibility. Not making sense for you, that&#039;s okay. Progress is not linear, it happens in jumps. I say that reactions should be an impossibility because energy has to exist in order to create a reaction, and energy cannot be destroyed. According to Einsteins theories, material objects are just energy compressed (I was having trouble wording that, but I&#039;m sure you understand the gist of it). This literally means that objects can react because the broken down form of that object exists. It doesn&#039;t make sense to me. The question &quot;why?&quot; now becomes a paradox and we have to have an outside influence in order to free one&#039;s self from this mental Fairy ring, and move on in the path to enlightenment.<br />
<br />
This comes to the touch on Idealism. This world seems not to make sense unless we put it into a perspective that something is correct (a paradox in itself). The basic thought that seems to be stuck with me as of now is &quot;If an Idea of the world didn&#039;t exist, would the world itself exist?&quot;. <br />
<br />
History follows the same wave as philosophic study, enlightenment, and questioning. Which leads me to believe that everything, in essence, is an Idea that has been elaborated on. For those who don&#039;t know the path of history (in a philosophical sense), I can enlighten you:<br />
<br />
First come the Thesis.<br />
<br />
Then comes the Anti-thesis<br />
<br />
These two reach a Synthesis<br />
<br />
The Synthesis is now the new Thesis and the process repeats.<br />
<br />
What is an Idea, but a variable? A variable is math, and math is an absolute. Quite possibly the only absolute in which one can accurately verify. &quot;why?&quot; you ask, because it is a set system, complete, and infinite. The way we interpret math, however; is not absolute, it is an Idea, which can then seem to form another paradox. <br />
<br />
Everything, is a variable, a simple yes or no, which then elaborates into something larger, in which we refer to as reality. This is also a paradox because it leads to the same fundamental problem we have from before. Change is supposed to be an impossibility, it doesn&#039;t seem mathematically (hey, another paradox) possible. <br />
<br />
True knowledge may exist in knowing that you know nothing, but what is nothing to know? Nothing is Change, and that is what I cannot understand.<br />
<br />
What disturbs be even more is that life is an illusion. The illusion that something is somehow more than a Yes or a No. Life, in itself, seems to be the illusion that there is a fundamental greyscale. The simplicity of this statement will probably through many people off and cause an uproar here in the next few days, but it is true.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, all we have is life is a Yes and a No. We comprise these yes&#039;s and no&#039;s into an overall chart which is then compared to other peoples charts (idea&#039;s) in order to create the full idea which then forms a Grey scale (touching yet again on a paradox).<br />
<br />
The world is deceptively simple. The greatest problem I seem to have with this world, this life, this universe is that is it fundamentally paradoxical. To put it simply, Yes has no evidence to point to why it exist, even mathematically.<br />
<br />
The fundamental rule that everything has it&#039;s opposite is so true and yet so fundamentally inconsistent, all in one breath. I guess tat Socrates is right, in the end. He made a summary, which then fueled the concept. <br />
<br />
This is why Idealism seems to be a correct path, but it could also be very wrong when it is used and practiced when people do not fully understand the concept.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand, nothing makes sense. God, why does everything have to be a Paradox? Is there no answer to this riddle? Maybe a key? Nothing? I have no Idea.....</div>

This is also a paradox because it leads to the same fundamental problem we have from before. Change is supposed to be an impossibility, it doesn&#039;t seem mathematically (hey, another paradox) possible. 

True knowledge may exist in knowing that you know nothing, but what is nothing to know? Nothing is Change, and that is what I cannot understand.

What disturbs be even more is that life is an illusion. The illusion that something is somehow more than a Yes or a No. Life, in itself, seems to be the illusion that there is a fundamental greyscale. The simplicity of this statement will probably through many people off and cause an uproar here in the next few days, but it is true.

Fundamentally, all we have is life is a Yes and a No. We comprise these yes&#039;s and no&#039;s into an overall chart which is then compared to other peoples charts (idea&#039;s) in order to create the full idea which then forms a Grey scale (touching yet again on a paradox).

The world is deceptively simple. The greatest problem I seem to have with this world, this life, this universe is that is it fundamentally paradoxical. To put it simply, Yes has no evidence to point to why it exist, even mathematically.

The fundamental rule that everything has it&#039;s opposite is so true and yet so fundamentally inconsistent, all in one breath. I guess tat Socrates is right, in the end. He made a summary, which then fueled the concept. 

This is why Idealism seems to be a correct path, but it could also be very wrong when it is used and practiced when people do not fully understand the concept.

I don&#039;t understand, nothing makes sense. God, why does everything have to be a Paradox? Is there no answer to this riddle? Maybe a key? Nothing? I have no Idea.....</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

a paradox basicaly runs in circles right?<br />
Think of it like this, every paradox in connected like those magic rings magicans use. so every circle connects, forming like a giant ringmale kind of thing that is the &quot;fabric of reality&quot;. =side note: ringmale is armor made of many tiny metal rings linked together.=<br />
also, Akio, your post supports duelism, does that mean you do as well?</div>

<br />
But that is only what we see...<br />
yes you are completely right...<br />
<br />
<br />
But can&#039;t we look towards the worlds in our minds that are ideal and enter that world?<br />
Enter an ideal world which we visualized(woohoo the word visualization), you&#039;ll be the God of that world...maybe I&#039;m getting into stuff that people are religious conflicting so I&#039;ll now shut up...<br />
<br />
We can seek for what we want to see, if everyone else has the same belief then what we want to see might come true...<br />
<br />
Or, maybe there is a way out of the paradox, other than death, there must be a way, a way to the truth that we are all seeking for? When you say we know nothing, that is true to me as well. But if we seek hard enough would we be able to know everything?<br />
We would have infinite wisdom... would that be another extreme that does not exist or that is something we are ultimately seeking for and are already achieved? If you ask where are those people who achieved it, I can only response that you can&#039;t see them, they live in a realm that we can not see yet, but can feel... And those people are the ones who are wising the best for every living creatures...<br />
<br />
Maybe I&#039;m getting too religious...But can&#039;t we see that world is not what we literally see? At least not all what we see. Psi exist and only some people can see it, do we see everything that exists? No... There are a lot more that we just don&#039;t understand... And to that, maybe a spiritual world exists there somewhere, and maybe a perfect world exists there...maybe a world for all of us exists...Even hell, heaven...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just getting delusional =p<br />
<br />
well, I&#039;d just like to share my view on the world =p<br />

The only reason I have touched on dualism, Idealism, and many of these topics is because I can see how they came into light as an Idea... It&#039;s odd, I will not say that I support dualism, however; I can say that dualism seems fairly correct at my current level of understanding.<br />
<br />
I say that there may be a &quot;key&quot;, or rather an paradoxical path,  because of a math problem I faced last year, In which I have reflected upon as of now. It involved a set of numbered boxes (1,2,3,4 &amp;5), to each represented how many of that number is used (the number in box 1 is equal to the total number of 1&#039;s in all the boxes, and so on). It turned out that every number except for one turned out to be a paradox.<br />
<br />
In the end, wouldn&#039;t this mean that there is the possibility for a &quot;divine path&quot;? or is it all duality and paradox? So many questions unanswered, and to explain them off shruggingly would be a blasphemy in itself. Why is it that those who seek this enlightenment are often ridiculed for the devotion they face.... I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m getting off topic.<br />
<br />
Is it we who are delusional, or everyone else? It&#039;s all a matter of perspective, and I see the vast population of people as fools who don&#039;t know or care to know anything. It sickens me.</div>

well, either care to know everything, or nothing at all.
