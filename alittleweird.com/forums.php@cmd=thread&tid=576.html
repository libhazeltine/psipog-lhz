<br />
&quot;The Randi challenge has a formal test in which a million dollars is supposedly available.  To pass the formal test, one must first pass a preliminary test which only Randi can declare a pass.  As of February 3, 2007, the Randi challenge still states that no one in the history of the prize has ever once even been allowed to do a formal test for the prize because Randi has never let anyone.  You cannot &quot;win&quot; the Randi challenge by playing within the rules of the challenge, because he doesn&#039;t want to let anyone play.<br />
<br />
The same ritual has happened a thousand times.  Someone files a claim to the Randi foundation, and then a representative from the Randi foundation ridicules this person repeatedly in every communication back and forth until the majority of claimants simply give up (many of these exchanges are available to read on the internet).  Those who continue are sometimes allowed a chance at a preliminary examination of their abilities by a representative of the foundation if they first agree to sign a document that gives the Randi foundation the right to ridicule them as much as desired in the future.  Some people fail the preliminary examination, and some have been found to pass the preliminary examination by the representative sent.  In no case however has Randi ever declared one a pass, and in every case the participant has been publicly ridiculed.  In some cases the Randi foundation has even been found to fraudulently edit the contents of communications with the claimant to make the claimant look silly, by changing what he or she has supposedly said.<br />
<br />
If the Publisher&#039;s Clearing House conducted their sweepstakes this way, they would be sued into oblivion.  It is not even close to a legitimate contest or challenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, theres a 1000 dollar challenge to anybody who can prove the test is a legitimate challenge. So far, nobody had passed that either. Youd think Randi would do it, just to shut him up at least. But he cant. Pretty much, Randi is a fraud and everybody knows it. </div>
