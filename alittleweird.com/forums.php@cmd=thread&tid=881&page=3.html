For the forums, I think forumotion would be best suited after all. Simply because it allows us to do pretty much anything with it for free whereas the other hosts will require payment for specific things like using our own domain name on it, etc.<br />
<br />
As for the chatrooms, Chatzy seems like a good choice. We can create a chat room and make it private (You need to invite the people you want to allow in the room. It send them an email with a link to the room.) Creating a room is simple too. I checked out tuxfamily, but I wasn&#039;t sure about it... They say they won&#039;t accept student groups and the like and you need their approval for every channel you create. (And we&#039;re gonna need many, as in one for every class.)<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think. If everybody approves, I&#039;ll go ahead and create them, register everything, then we can figure the rest out.</div>

<br />
Tell me what you think. If everybody approves, I&#039;ll go ahead and create them, register everything, then we can figure the rest out.</div>I approve..   In other words: &quot;DO WANT&quot;<br />
<br />
But we should make sure we&#039;re 100% on what we&#039;re going to be doing..  We need to look through the possible suggestions on post one in this thread NOW and show a vote of what we agree with and do not agree with.<br />
We all need to be on the same page now, and if we get this site started and everyone is running in circles, it&#039;ll be bad for everyone.<br />
<br />
This is also the last chance to come up with any other suggestions, if you guys don&#039;t feel right about something.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
[Name]   I&#039;d like &quot;The Academy&quot; as the name..<br />
[Plan]  We don&#039;t seem to lack resources for the Library plan, and it&#039;d be faster.<br />
[Progress] Agree with both, and yes; possible exams.<br />
[Who&#039;s who]  I agree with the second two, and possibly the first if becoming a teacher is a -possibility -based off of the individual applying. (the wording made me cautious)<br />
[Motivation] Agree with all<br />
[Quality] Agree with all, but the public section shouldn&#039;t be a part of the forums. (personal beef)<br />
[Staff]  Erm..  Well, I agree with all those too..  Although I&#039;d like to be sure on what the teachers would teach, so we&#039;d be sure on how many topics will be covered.<br />
<br />
I really hope we don&#039;t have to hunt down a telepath..</div>

Just hold a beginner&#039;s seminar every few days on IRC, teaching people how to make a psiball. If they succeed, then the teacher can verify whether they did or not, and then let them register.

It makes making a psiball seem like an especially easy task, and most people would be motivated enough to want to do it.[/quote]

@ Insectiod:

I like the idea of a Beginner&#039;s Class, we could hold one a week, and upon successful completion of the class (hopefully) have the option of joining.[/quote]


Where have you guys been?    Thats already been suggested..  By me.
Edit--
And mrj, sorry bro. ;p

Alright, I checked out different forum hosts and chatroom services.

For the forums, I think forumotion would be best suited after all. Simply because it allows us to do pretty much anything with it for free whereas the other hosts will require payment for specific things like using our own domain name on it, etc.

As for the chatrooms, Chatzy seems like a good choice. We can create a chat room and make it private (You need to invite the people you want to allow in the room. It send them an email with a link to the room.) Creating a room is simple too. I checked out tuxfamily, but I wasn&#039;t sure about it... They say they won&#039;t accept student groups and the like and you need their approval for every channel you create. (And we&#039;re gonna need many, as in one for every class.)

Tell me what you think. If everybody approves, I&#039;ll go ahead and create them, register everything, then we can figure the rest out.[/quote]

I approve..   In other words: &quot;DO WANT&quot;

But we should make sure we&#039;re 100% on what we&#039;re going to be doing..  We need to look through the possible suggestions on post one in this thread NOW and show a vote of what we agree with and do not agree with.
We all need to be on the same page now, and if we get this site started and everyone is running in circles, it&#039;ll be bad for everyone.

This is also the last chance to come up with any other suggestions, if you guys don&#039;t feel right about something.

For example, 
[Name]   I&#039;d like &quot;The Academy&quot; as the name..
[Plan]  We don&#039;t seem to lack resources for the Library plan, and it&#039;d be faster.
[Progress] Agree with both, and yes; possible exams.
[Who&#039;s who]  I agree with the second two, and possibly the first if becoming a teacher is a -possibility -based off of the individual applying. (the wording made me cautious)
[Motivation] Agree with all
[Quality] Agree with all, but the public section shouldn&#039;t be a part of the forums. (personal beef)
[Staff]  Erm..  Well, I agree with all those too..  Although I&#039;d like to be sure on what the teachers would teach, so we&#039;d be sure on how many topics will be covered.

I really hope we don&#039;t have to hunt down a telepath..</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Sorry to hear it. I&#039;m out.</div>Hey, SL..  No reason to take it so personally.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re new, and you still know more about OBEs than I do.<br />
I read the course you prepared, and it was a tossup between really good, and kinda fluffy.<br />
<br />
You have a lot of potential in the area, if you just focused on the things you yourself could verify, I&#039;m sure one day pretty soon, you could probably be a great teacher..  .. It seems like your heart is in the right place, you just need to apply what you&#039;ve read to assure that its the truth, before trying to show it off as the truth.<br />
//<br />
<br />
Riven and Sussch..<br />
<br />
Just because we&#039;d be grading them off of knowledge doesn&#039;t mean we wont be making them practice.<br />
As a matter of fact, I believe in a &quot;learn by doing&quot; type of teaching, and I really hope any sort of skill will become second nature to them just by studying with us.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t guarantee they&#039;ll keep practicing after class is over, but since the class projects I mentioned earlier will probably more than half the time include a practice session- I can assume they&#039;ll grow at least a little in skill each class...  Even if they know all about it, cooperation with the session will make up the score of the project.<br />
<br />
If you have any more worries or objections (or if I didn&#039;t clear the air),  let me, us or them know.  As long as your voice is heard.<br />

Hey, SL..  No reason to take it so personally.

You&#039;re new, and you still know more about OBEs than I do.
I read the course you prepared, and it was a tossup between really good, and kinda fluffy.

You have a lot of potential in the area, if you just focused on the things you yourself could verify, I&#039;m sure one day pretty soon, you could probably be a great teacher..  .. It seems like your heart is in the right place, you just need to apply what you&#039;ve read to assure that its the truth, before trying to show it off as the truth.

Riven and Sussch..

Just because we&#039;d be grading them off of knowledge doesn&#039;t mean we wont be making them practice.
As a matter of fact, I believe in a &quot;learn by doing&quot; type of teaching, and I really hope any sort of skill will become second nature to them just by studying with us.

I can&#039;t guarantee they&#039;ll keep practicing after class is over, but since the class projects I mentioned earlier will probably more than half the time include a practice session- I can assume they&#039;ll grow at least a little in skill each class...  Even if they know all about it, cooperation with the session will make up the score of the project.

If you have any more worries or objections (or if I didn&#039;t clear the air),  let me, us or them know.  As long as your voice is heard.

I&#039;m pretty sure Raathus is skilled at telepathy.

I&#039;m good at energy manipulation, and empathy, and decent at PK.[/quote]

How skilled?
Think he&#039;d be willing to teach?
