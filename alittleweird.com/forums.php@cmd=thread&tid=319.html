Quit the contrary to some of the replies..<br />
Children aren&#039;t born with the concept &quot;Nothing is possible and you&#039;re locked into a limited mechanical world. too bad for you.&quot; That&#039;s drilled into us all from age one.<br />

I&#039;ve talked to a few children about it myself, including my own daughter and twin six year old cousins(Who happen to be the most ADHD/inattentive children you can find.)<br />

But every child is different and Vimick is right in some ways;  they have to be ready.<br />
Not to mention,  they still need time for their body to develop to a stable state in which they can channel energy with out it being too damaging;  you need to take it slow. </div>

RazSh18, I think that it indeed is a bit harsh, but that is not the important question I think. The important question is, in my opinion, does she care? If so, I don&#039;t think she is ready, if she doens&#039;t care, she might get you some nice results. (just my view)</div>

Chances are that the only real advantage of teaching a child psionics would be that the child would not be hindered by doubt and would have a little experience to begin with. These strong roots in psionics could prove useful in the long run if they are acted upon. It&#039;s much like teaching a child self-defense at a young age: The training gets so rooted into their minds that it gives them a massive advantage when they are older and almost does the work for them. I should know, I took karate lessons from the age of 5 to the age of 11. Much of the training has still not left me. I even have self-defensive reflex reactions from time to time when &quot;threatened&quot;. <br />

Well, all we can do is theorize anyway, so we&#039;ll just have to observe the results for ourselves. </div>
