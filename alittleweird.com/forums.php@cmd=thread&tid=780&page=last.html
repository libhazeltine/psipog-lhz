I doubt it will happen immediately, but I believe it is only a matter of time before psi and science become psience xD<br />

My secret wish is that psionics gets proven to the point that it stops being such a &quot;wierd&quot; subject to discuss, and that one can experiment with it without being ostracized.<br />

<br />
And as for the video, it was alright. I did manage to watch the entire thing because it was quite interesting, but I already knew everything that was explained and found it a bit overdramatic at some parts, especially the discussion of antimatter and vacuum energy/quantum fluctuations... too much of a drama and not enough of a journey through quantum mechanics =p<br />
<br />
The other day I was thinking about willpower as a possible fifth fundamental force; I thought about it because I&#039;ve been playing around with some kind of total unity/universe-and-everything-in-it-is-god kind of thought paradigm for about a year or two now; Can willpower as some kind of wacked out fundamental force explain and give depth to things science doesn&#039;t touch right now?<br />

<br />
But, I&#039;ll still throw something out there to address this so-called &#039;willpower&#039; you speak of..<br />
<br />
We have been a reflection of our environment since the beginning of our growth as a single cell.. the body we are born into is a predisposition, and this seems to be an unforgiving law of nature.. (when I think nature, I think balance.. anyways.)<br />
<br />
The body we operate, is like our computer.. our predispositioned hardware. From it, we recieve a predispositioned capacity from which we draw predispositioned reactions to predispositioned situations.. (I think) we&#039;re living a predispositioned pattern!<br />
<br />
Think of it like this, the word brain comes from the word membrane.. and what does a membrane do? It relays information from the outside, to the inside, and your brain is like a big sponge, soakin in all of your predispositioned environment.. <br />
<br />

<br />
I think intuition and determinism do exist, and that through healthy lifestyle and views, it is possible to flow perfectly with life.. (but only if you are predisposed with intuition, and determinism, and such and such ;)<br />
<br />
Sometimes my views get me into trouble, but this is just part of my predisposition.<br />
<br />
(If life was random chaos, then everything would be random chaos, and I dont really think thats at all fair to say about the universe.. cause she&#039;s not dicey!)<br />
<br />
Now.. I think your talking about willpower in the sense of willing, say, a psiwheel to move, or an OBE to occur.. but whos to say that if you hadnt heard about it in the first place, that it would have occurred at all.. you are a product of your environment..<br />
(you heard about it from a friend who lived in the same community as you because his dad was a fisherman too.. and so on and so on..) And whos to say that if you could go back and do it all again, if you would have been in the same state of mind, makin the same choices.. etc, etc.<br />
<br />
I believe Memetics is a subtle form of universal evolution, and we are the product of an aging/evolving environment. This is my response to you because when science has it figured out, the universe will suddenly become bored with itself and shrink up into a golfball sized mass of infinite potential again. <br />
<br />
And yes, I do realize that by posting this message, I risk the chance of this happening right now..</div>
