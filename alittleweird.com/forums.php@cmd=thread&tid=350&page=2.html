My youngest half sister once told me that she met a man who she just &quot;knew&quot; was evil despite his contradicting outward demeanor.

I can only concede that it would have been more beneficial for me to look into it, but the truth is that I don&#039;t like meddling in other people&#039;s affairs. I&#039;m not outgoing enough for that kind of thing.</div>

<br />
I think that the 4th one can be related to many different things, The most accurate that I have studied is a constuct psychic vampire created by negative personal emotions. These are supposedly created by the person or directly from the emotions of the person it drains. It could be that, at the time, you were trying to get something off of your chest, but were overcome by fear. When you began to pay more attention in class, you had, in effect, conquered the feat you were trying to conquer at the time. This would release the fears you had on the matter and cause your self created psy-vamp to be released. <br />
<br />
The other explination would be a Shadow person who decided to inhabit your body for a while. This is essentially to the same effect, but there are key differences. For one, shadow people are supposed to be souls not yet born. Some are dark, some are light. It is possible that one would use a body with any hint of fear in order to enter and to feed off of it&#039;s host.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these are just based on the popular discription of each, they are not in any way my personal description of shadow people or constuct psy-vamps, however; these two things are both things I have experience in dealing with.<br />

Isn&#039;t flaring when you make the psiball visible through compression and basically &quot;sparking&quot; the energy so that it momentarily flares into a visible state?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been working on it lately, and without much effort, I can put my whole aura into a visible spectrum. The Psyball was emminating light, not just for a moment, but from every part of it&#039;s formation, without using any extra energy, without compression. It&#039;s not because of the energies motion that it creates light, but that the energy itself is visible, even in normal light if I want it. <br />
<br />
Right now, it&#039;s like a fog, a truely visible psiball, I see a type of lightning zapping around in it, it can be any color, and it can encompass the whole of my aura. I&#039;m not completely sure, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s straightforward flaring.<br />
<br />

@wandering wolf<br />
<br />
I have found that comepsychic abilities are past from generation from generation. One of my best friends has premonitions almost every night when he dreams. Ost of his life is a huge dejavu for him. Infact, the majority of his family is like that. His mother used to be a practicing witch, until an incident with a ouija board (one other experience to add to the list, I can tell you all about it later) which caused her to give up on the practice.<br />
<br />
His Family is extremely sensitive to Paranormal activity. It&#039;s rather interesting to know someone like that.<br />
<br />
There are other interesting traits that pop up out of know where  in people, This could be attributed to subtle genetic mutations or any kind of chemical inbalance in the blood. one of my friends has the predominant ability to control both shadows and light at the same time, he has clearly visible energy with specific effects.<br />
<br />
two things that I&#039;ve seen him do that are really cool. <br />
<br />

I think that the 4th one can be related to many different things, The most accurate that I have studied is a constuct psychic vampire created by negative personal emotions. These are supposedly created by the person or directly from the emotions of the person it drains. It could be that, at the time, you were trying to get something off of your chest, but were overcome by fear. When you began to pay more attention in class, you had, in effect, conquered the feat you were trying to conquer at the time. This would release the fears you had on the matter and cause your self created psy-vamp to be released. 

The other explination would be a Shadow person who decided to inhabit your body for a while. This is essentially to the same effect, but there are key differences. For one, shadow people are supposed to be souls not yet born. Some are dark, some are light. It is possible that one would use a body with any hint of fear in order to enter and to feed off of it&#039;s host.

Keep in mind that these are just based on the popular discription of each, they are not in any way my personal description of shadow people or constuct psy-vamps, however; these two things are both things I have experience in dealing with.

Isn&#039;t flaring when you make the psiball visible through compression and basically &quot;sparking&quot; the energy so that it momentarily flares into a visible state?

I&#039;ve been working on it lately, and without much effort, I can put my whole aura into a visible spectrum. The Psyball was emminating light, not just for a moment, but from every part of it&#039;s formation, without using any extra energy, without compression. It&#039;s not because of the energies motion that it creates light, but that the energy itself is visible, even in normal light if I want it. 

Right now, it&#039;s like a fog, a truely visible psiball, I see a type of lightning zapping around in it, it can be any color, and it can encompass the whole of my aura. I&#039;m not completely sure, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s straightforward flaring.

@wandering wolf

I have found that comepsychic abilities are past from generation from generation. One of my best friends has premonitions almost every night when he dreams. Ost of his life is a huge dejavu for him. Infact, the majority of his family is like that. His mother used to be a practicing witch, until an incident with a ouija board (one other experience to add to the list, I can tell you all about it later) which caused her to give up on the practice.

His Family is extremely sensitive to Paranormal activity. It&#039;s rather interesting to know someone like that.

There are other interesting traits that pop up out of know where  in people, This could be attributed to subtle genetic mutations or any kind of chemical inbalance in the blood. one of my friends has the predominant ability to control both shadows and light at the same time, he has clearly visible energy with specific effects.

two things that I&#039;ve seen him do that are really cool. 

1.) He used his energy to create a &quot;blade&quot; of shadows that jutted out from his wrist, anywhere the blade touched causedme to go numb and I guess it cut my chakra flows because for quite a while later, I couldn&#039;t manipulate energy past the &quot;cut&quot; points.

2.) He made a visible psiball in the form of a ying-yang. this really had no point other than the fast that it looked cool. It rotated as well, like a slow moving wheel, even though, if you looked really close, there was a much faster energy current running through it.

What I am doing is bringing it into a visible spectrum without losing any energy, but rather increasing it&#039;s wavelength even before it reaches my hands, getting it as close to the source as I can, the emortions, My emotion determines colour, and the intensity of the emotion determines brightness. </div>

I think it could be that initial fear that it instilled in you by dissipearing that allowed for it to attach to you. That&#039;s one way possesion works.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve Heard of it happening with other emotions, but fear and doubt are by far the most common that are used because they are debilitating to psychic abilities. <br />
<br />
It is possible that your spiritual defences were down, and the creature used that to enter, but fear and doubt are great ways of dropping those defences if the person doesn&#039;t keep calm, I think it might have to do with the fight or flight response.<br />
<br />
The Blades look like simple shadows, but as they pass by your body you feel a cutting sensation and it &quot;cuts&quot; your energy out from that point on. I could try to explain, but I don&#039;t want to mislead you in any way ^_^.<br />

Oh, as for the energy flow, you have to create a psi-blade, there aretwo ways you can do this.<br />
<br />
1.) Create a construct of some form, like a sword for example, and focus the energy, dense it up and compact it untill it feels almost solid. note: this breaks easily if you aren&#039;t careful<br />
<br />
2.) Create a construct as before and spin the energy around at sharp angles to form a type of blade, this requires intense focus to use or maintain, but can even cause damage to theskin if strong enough.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_8221">I&#039;ve never dealt with one personally, so I can&#039;t be sure, although it seems possible that it could dissipate in a visible form. It could have just been another psy vamps Construct that decided to feed off of you, It&#039;s not unheard of. I think it could be that initial fear that it instilled in you by dissipearing that allowed for it to attach to you. That&#039;s one way possesion works.

I&#039;ve Heard of it happening with other emotions, but fear and doubt are by far the most common that are used because they are debilitating to psychic abilities. 

It is possible that your spiritual defences were down, and the creature used that to enter, but fear and doubt are great ways of dropping those defences if the person doesn&#039;t keep calm, I think it might have to do with the fight or flight response.

		<div id="post_8223" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Thank you for the useful information, Akio. I&#039;ve only tried making a construct once and it probably wasn&#039;t even a success from what I could tell, but, one day, I might give it a shot once I&#039;ve improved my energy manipulation proficiency. I&#039;ve been exposed to psionics for a few years, but my path quickly strayed to that of spirituality and I gave up the practices that I had once held so dearly. I didn&#039;t even give myself much of a chance to find out what my aptitudes were. I intend to begin practicing again very soon.<br />
<br />
It will allow me to hit two birds with one stone, as I will be able to confirm a theory or two that I&#039;ve had for a long time that I was never able to support with hard evidence. Until then, I will probably make a thread or two concerning milder theories and questions as well as a spiritual thread or two. If the forums get stagnant and boring, I&#039;ll be sure to give everyone something to think about and comment on if I can. I guess that&#039;s the least I can do as a member of this website.</div>

By the way, in case you have read this before looking at the energy vampire thread, I tried answering your question about throwing psi balls. It might just work for you.<br />
<br />
Akio, I’d like to hear your thoughts on the question I posed for you concerning psychic reception on my second to last post on my personality thread if you wouldn’t mind. I’ve been burning to know what kind of psychic reception you were referring to and why you know/believe that it is limited to a short distance (with the exception of powerful stimuli as you had mentioned).<br />
<br />
Also, concerning our beliefs dealing with observation (mentioned in my own thread), do you believe that we are on the same page and that we more or less agree on the same thing? <br />
<br />
<br />
@somefatguy<br />
<br />
I have trouble believing that what you saw actually existed in a physical form. Perhaps it was some form of clairvoyance: A realistic vision so to speak. What do you think Akio? Anyone? <br />
<br />
<br />
@ace_of_ spades<br />
<br />
I’ve never heard of anything like that before. What I want to know is how the crystal could gather so much negative energy. Did this guy have a bad temper or something? You make it sound like the energy in the crystal is demonic and beyond human capabilities. Did the owner of the crystal or his girlfriend have anything to say about the crystal? Did they notice something strange about it too?</div>

wierdest experience for me has got to be all of the happening sin one day i had a year ago.<br />
<br />
started off in the morning. <br />
i went to class and was hearing these wierd ringing noises. kind of like someone playing music with crystal glasses. <br />
the noises got louder and dissapeared and than came back. lasted for about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
than in the next class i asked my friend if i could practice a psi-attack on him (he said it was ok but thought i was crazy) so i created a psi ball and started to program it with visions of a car crash to give him a headache. i sent it out and several seconds later the desk in front of me (noone was even near it) started to violently shake. <br />
there was nothing touching the desk and it was seperate from all other desks so it couldnt have been someone bumping into it.<br />
<br />
later when i got home i was sitting down on my couch and was laying down. my step-mom came in and started lokoing for me. she was looking right at me and i was in the wide open but she never saw me. i guess i must have accidentally created an invisibility psi shield<br />
<br />
about 30 minutes after that i was very exhausted and could not walk straight or do anything. i went to my room to lay down and passed out immediately at my doorstep. i woke up with an intense headache<br />

and all of this happened in 1 day &gt;.&lt;</div>
