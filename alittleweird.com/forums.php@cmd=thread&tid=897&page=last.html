The whole 2012 thing seems somewhat overblown - how could Mayans have seen something happen in such a distant future? Maybe they made a slight miscalculation or something and the so-called end of the world already occurred in the 16th or 17th century? But then again, why did they create a calendar that lasted beyond their own existence?<br />
Let&#039;s just wait and see, what comes - it could be something spectacular or something as dull as the year 2000.<br />
<br />
As for the viruses, they have performed compulsory vaccinations that have led to a lot more deaths than the real viruses actually caused. Biological weaponry is a real problem and such an attack is difficult to prove.<br />
<br />
Just an opinion without any proofs..</div>

<br />
About AIDS: Are you referring to that video where the guy says George W. Bush built a time machine, went to Mesopotamia during the Jurassic, and spread his man-made AIDS to infect all dinosaurs, making lots of fossils in the area and that&#039;s why he sent his troops there to take over and recover the fossil fuel he create with AIDS in the Jurassic? Things like this is why I tend not to believe in things about the Illuminati... Oh, also, AIDS isn&#039;t a virus; HIV is. ;D</div>
