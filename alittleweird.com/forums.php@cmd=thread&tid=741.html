The meditation I saw focused on making one of your hands larger than the other, and vice versa. He made it seem fairly complex, but when I tried it for myself, I was able to perform this task easily, and very quickly.. I can get up to a centimeter growth on one side, and then the other, four times a minute!<br />

I show some people, and they call it witchcraft..<br />

I dont think I&#039;ll show them the psi wheel..<br />

know of anything else?</div>

		<div id="post_13747" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yeah, blood moving was my first thought.. I guess maybe I just have great control over my flow.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give you an idea of the vision..<br />
<br />
I was an omniscient viewer in a sacrificial circle.. there were torches and dark robed figures chanting and brutally torturing people on a slab in the middle of a statue enclosed circle..<br />
<br />
After what seemed like two or three hundred years, the hooded men disappeared.. time seemed to move much faster after that, and the pillars turned into sand, and I was alone in a desert.. I had no body, I was just viewing everything..<br />
<br />
Desert eventually turned into forest.. forest produced critters which scurried about the underbrush.. and then hunters showed up. Men with scraps of animal fur clothing and sharp sticks began to accumulate, and so, they had to pull together and organize a functioning society.. this order brought pillars.. and pillars brought robes and chanting, and I was in the same circle I started off in!!<br />
<br />
I began to loose my mind.. screaming.. <br />
<br />
All the while, I was absolutely amazed and terrified, but up until this point, I decided not to cause a fuss, because whatever was in control of this vision, was waaaay outta my league.. and I decided to just be cool.. but I had had enough..<br />
<br />
A being of light came to me, and saved me from this evil place..<br />
<br />
Im gonna leave it at that.. unless you have any questions..<br />
<br />
Thank you for the replies</div>

<br />
The whole episode lasted ten minutes..<br />
<br />
The sensation I had afterwards, was comparable to being mentally raped..<br />

At first, I was very upset that someone out there may now know everything about me..<br />

I had heard about this 2012 stuff a few months before hand, but it wasnt untill recently that I put them together.. yes.. I am looking into 2012..<br />
