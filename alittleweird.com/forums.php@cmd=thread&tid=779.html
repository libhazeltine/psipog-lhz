		<div id="post_14216" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I usually got a headache when I tried to move a lot of energy through my head.<br />
Then I thought that maybe going really slow with these things is the right way to do it.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I decided to do something about it.<br />
I traced the psi flow and found that it just crashes into some kind of shield or something without actually getting out of the head. I don&#039;t know what it was, I&#039;ll just call it a wall since now.<br />
<br />
I visualized opened doors wherever this painful crashing seemed to take place.<br />
The headache lessened with every door that I opened.<br />
<br />
Finally the whole head was full of open doors and I thought: &quot;What&#039;s the point of this wall anyway. Oh, well, I&#039;ll just leave the doors open for 1 night and see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were 2 round lumps of something in my neck that also seemed to block the energy flow and flushed those too.<br />
<br />
After that I felt a lot cleaner during psi practice. There also seemed to be a difference in the amount of psi I was able to feel.<br />
<br />
On to the questions:<br />
1. How and why are psi blockages formed?<br />
2. Is everything that blocks psi called a psi blockage?<br />
3. Is the &quot;wall&quot; just something that everybody has and that is there as some kind of default protection gear or could I have made it myself (and forgotten about it)?<br />
4. What happens when one &quot;shuts down&quot; from psi practice (could it be related to the blockages)?</div>

<br />
1. I&#039;m pretty sure most of them are created by yourself unconsciously by actually &quot;blocking&quot;. For example if you don&#039;t want to hear something (some skeptics are like that) or maybe also if you have headache and just want to be left alone, so you simply shut yourself. Another possibility would be that they are created by someone else to harm you, but that one is rarer then the former I&#039;d say.<br />
<br />
2. Well, one is called &#039;Shield&#039; ^^ others are called &#039;Seals&#039;. I&#039;d say it depends on how they are created<br />

I think it also has to do with injuries and such, like my back was sort of crooked in some spots and it was hard to move psi around.</div>Thats also an interesting idea. I&#039;d say the bigger the injury, the greater the blockage. And maybe permanent injuries cause permanent blockages (If you have nothing to overcome that).<br />
<br />
Hmm...., that might also be the reason why permanent injuries stay permanent. I&#039;m doing qigong for a half year now and there is a guy who did computer work for about 20 years or so and his right shoulder - due to the lack of movement - got so stiff that he could only hardly move it. when he tried to lift his right arm his shoulder would go back to allow his arm to go up a bit. He started with qigong a few weeks after me. Now he can raise his arm pretty much like anyone should be able to -&gt; strait up pointing to the heavens.<br />
<br />
Enough with the story telling, here&#039;s my idea and why this story might be important:<br />
Permanent injuries start as injuries caused by something (could be almost anything). This causes blockages in this area so that part of the body has less energy running through it --&gt; movement of that part becomes difficult and because of the injury might hurt --&gt; less movement of this part --&gt; blockage becomes more severe --&gt; injury becomes permanent.<br />
Then, if the blockage is removed, the injury can cure.</div>
