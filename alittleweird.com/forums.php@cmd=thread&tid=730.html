		<div id="post_13600" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">What&#039;s up guys? I used to post on Psipog alot when I was younger under this ID. I made it when I was 16, I know its lame, but just in case any of the same people are still hanging around I figured I&#039;d keep it.<br />
So yeah I saw like a shadow man on my ceiling a little while ago, and it scared the ever living @#%# out of me. It was on my ceiling, in the shape of a guy wearing a hat. I moved my hand to see if it was my arm casting the shadow and nothing happened. It was somewhat dark in my room but not so much that you couldnt see clearly. So I went to go turn my light on and the shadow started sliding in a dead straight line aross the ceiling. So I stopped, moved my arms around again, and it just stayed there motionless on the ceiling. I went to go turn the light on again and the shadow slid completely across the ceiling, down the wall and into nothingness. I did not sleep for a month after that incident.<br />
This happened in the fall I think, I was thinking about it tonight and thought Psipog would be a good place to see if anyone else had any similar experiences. Psipog is now defunct apparently so now I&#039;m here. <br />
Any info, idea&#039;s, ect. would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks guys, <br />

If I was you, I would try to get this shadow man to reappear.<br />
Do you think they can be caught on camera? I&#039;ve also had some shadow people experiences, but they are usually less interactive than the one you encountered.<br />
Just gotta love the interesting stories on the ALW forums! </div>

Once I got into the shower and as I was stepping in, some pure black blob (well, it seemed like a ball or something about that shape) of about 20 centimeters diameter fell from the ceiling to the bottom of the shower. Pretty fast that was, as I looked down on the floor there was nothing.<br />
Another time, when I was on my way to school suddenly something small and pink with about the same size rushed from the left to the right, in mid-air. As i looked to right I didn&#039;t see anything.<br />

That two experiences are years ago, but happened only about two weeks apart, I guess. But I can&#039;t remember any feeling of dread, like described on the site you linked Tallyman. Only an understandable feeling of surprise</div>

I attribute it more so to the &quot;astral nasties&quot; concept. The closer and more frequent you visit the Astral for instance, the more entities that dwell there become visible to you. That or a more developed sense of awareness toward such entities by means of clairvoyance or general spiritual development. It&#039;s hard to say. It also brings back memories of Constantine, the whole &quot;you see them they see you&quot; thing. Could be due to your practices in general, the more you practice different things the higher you &quot;resonate&quot; in the other planes of existence and the more attention you get from other beings. *shrugs* really have no clue what to tell you :P perhaps clean your surrounding area and they will stop appearing if they scare you. Or convince yourself they don&#039;t exist. Fear of seeing things usually works in not seeing them. That or creating their appearance in your mind.</div>

		<div id="post_13609" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I wasn&#039;t attempting to promote negativity and fear in such a situation. I was simply stating the obvious. If someone doesn&#039;t wish to see things like this, the mind is very effective in washing these images out if you convince yourself that you are too &quot;scared&quot; of it. There are a lot of people who saw things when they were kids, but because they thought it couldn&#039;t exist, or because they were too scared, they drowned out the images. That&#039;s all I was saying.<br />
<br />
If you would WANT to make contact with whatever &quot;it&quot; is, then I would still strongly advise that some precautions are made. Nothing worse than trying to go and be all diplomatic overseas without anyone knowing you&#039;re over there to offer protection if something goes wrong. I have my own feelings on &quot;shielding&quot; but in this instance a &quot;shield&quot; would probably be advised. I also don&#039;t think it should be done in a threatening manor. I know if someone came to me holding a shield, strapped with a sword, and had a big smile on their face I&#039;d be fairly concerned they were going to try to make me laugh and then chop off my head. In which case I&#039;d either flea the scene or react in a similar way.<br />
<br />
It takes some thinking before you run out there and just do something. Trust and respect are good qualities, but nothing beats preparation and purpose. Why would you want to make contact, and what out of this &quot;meeting&quot; would you hope to achieve? All questions you should consider before doing it.</div>

		<div id="post_13616" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Wow, I didn&#039;t know there was an actual term for these entities. A few years ago, I saw something that I guess I can now call shadow people. I was looking out across the street from my mom&#039;s house where there&#039;s a gated field. My sister happen to be there too and all of a sudden, these two black figures started darting across the field. At first I thought it was people, but I noticed they were practically zooming from one end of the field to the other in no time and they were both black as night with no discernable characteristics. I felt like I couldn&#039;t even keep my eyes on them, they were so fast and strange. There was no sound coming from them, and then they just disappeared. I looked at my sister and she looked at me and I had to ask her twice if we just saw what we saw. I&#039;m glad she was there otherwise I would&#039;ve not been sure. Wow, shadow people.<br />
That&#039;s a little frightening that it was right in your room realman. </div>

I was thinking, I don&#039;t practice astral travel or psionics or any of the other things suggested in the posts, nor do I think I&#039;m clairvoyant. It got me thinking though and I remembered that around the time this happened me and some friends were going out &quot;Ghosthunting&quot; alot. Maybe that has something to do with it. Let me tell you though, seeing something like that in your BEDROOM is FREAKY!!!!!!!<br />
Thanks again guys.<br />

Also never forget you might see certain things in something that might have been light casting a shadow on a t-shirt that was drying in the stairway or the sun that breaks through the clouds etc.</div>
