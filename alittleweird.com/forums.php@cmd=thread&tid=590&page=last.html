		<div id="post_11726" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Darned homework... well, im still posting this...<br />
<br />
So, ive had my fair share of experience with sleep paralysis, and although the first time was somewhat scary, it started to get interesting. In fact, 2 days ago, i had many (about 5) successive sleep paralysises. Yeah, as in one right after another.<br />
<br />
First off, scaring me is extremely hard, which is why after my first sleep paralysis i was no longer scared of it. Weeks later after that, i had another one, and i was interested in this one; i had all of my senses aware and tried to examine it. Though, it was a failure because i got too relaxed and got out of it. Noow, some days after that (2 days ago) i had another sleep paralysis, and i thought &quot;Ah cool&quot; (now im just gonna list them and say what i did in each)<br />
<br />
On the first one- i did what i did last time and tried to examine it as much as possible, but it didnt last long. <br />
<br />
Then, i got back to my random thinking, and suddenly i went back into another one. This one, i remembered that getting too relaxed got me out of it. So, i tried to keep a healthy level of &#039;omg&#039; in order to make it last longer. I heard what some would describe as: being extremely close to metal that is being crushed, being under a low flying plane, or even some beast cries. Then i snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
On my normal self, i noticed that i wasnt thinking really, but i was having some sort of self controlled thinkage =d. Just like watching a movie in my mind (about a guy trapped who couldnt get out of a room and kept pounding on the wall...) and i went into another one... In this one, i tried to control it. Tried to make it sound louder, as loud as possible, and succeded, but i couldnt control what the sound was or put the volume down. Tried to move too, but you know how that turns out--<br />
<br />
I got out of it, and now i was seeing some ant like creature trying to escape a complex tunnel... mildly entertaining i shall say. Then i went into another one, (i wasnt surprised at the frequency of them til next day) this one, i actually remembered i could OBE out of it. So, i tried what i could, but i could only &#039;feel&#039; my hands out. Felt them just waving around... I couldnt OBE though.<br />
<br />
Last one was pretty much like the 4th one which is a shame because ive gotten real close to OBEing but never could.<br />
<br />
No, i dont have any serious health issues and i havent had any in the past. Except for the occasional cold and those. Also, i dont make up stuff :l. I joined psipog when i was 12 or so (got banned from the chat once for being underage too, woo) and i check up on this site often, i just never post.. eh <br />
<br />
Anyways, this was a really interesting event, hopefully i can recreate it.<br />
<br />
comments anyone?</div>

		<div id="post_11735" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">i remember i used to experience spontaneous sleep paralysis occasionally when i was younger, like about 10-11 years old. the first time really freaked me out, cos i was awake but yet i could not move my body. for me, sleep paralysis often last for quite some time(in my perspective). i remember waiting for some time before falling into a brief unconscious state(or was it subconscious state?) before waking up normally. i did not know anything about OBE then, otherwise i would have been able to try it when that happened.<br />
sometimes when i feel a bit lazier than usual and just laze in bed, i would try to &quot;induce&quot; sleep paralysis, and there would be times when i suddenly entered this state. i don&#039;t really know how i did it though. it was scary the first time(felt like i was on anaesthesia), but later on i felt like as if i missed something after every experience with sleep paralysis.<br />
well as i grew older(im 18 now), these sleep paralysis occured less frequently, and now i rarely experience sleep paralysis. but from this experience, i have this hypothesis that younger children experience sleep paralysis more frequently than adults. what do you guys think?<br />
p.s. im going to do an experiment to try to induce sleep paralysis(and maybe even OBE) when im just about to wake up, by looping a binaural beat track used for OBE, and listening to it while i sleep. i&#039;ll tell you guys about the results next time.</div>

As the wonderer that i am, i kept thinking of some other random stuff, but the thought of ghosts videos hadnt fully escaped my mind. <br />

Later, i just started  having a self controlled way of thinking which included themes of desperation (like the &#039;thing&#039; trying to get out of a complex puzzle and a guy pounding on a wall trying to get out).
