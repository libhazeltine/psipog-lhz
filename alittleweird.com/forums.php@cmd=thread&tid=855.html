If anything does, happen, it&#039;ll be a polar shift, which will pretty much cook us alive... But nobody really knows, the last pole shift was thousands of years ago... 780,000, I think... In any case, the theories are varied, some even think the LHC will open a black hole... Which is impossible, by the way. It makes antimatter, which is totally different from dark matter. And it would take 2 billion years to create enough antimatter to make a nuclear explosion with a diameter of six meters... (That&#039;s 0.001 times the Hiroshima explosion, which had a diameter of about 6 kilometers and that&#039;s counting the radiation and all, if I remember correctly.) It would take something like 30kg of antimatter to blow up the Earth, which would take 70000000000000 years to generate. (That&#039;s 70 trillion years.) And one way or another, antimatter annihilates with the matter around it when it is formed, which means we couldn&#039;t even hope to create that much with our present technology and I doubt aliens will come over and give us an antimatter bomb in the next three years...<br />

I have this strange feeling that you have been wanting to share piece of information for a very long time, but have never be able to properly apply it to at topic, or it could just be me.<br />

I have never heard of antimatter before. Where did you learn about it?<br />
<br />
And what is LHC? I wish I knew these terms, but sometimes I&#039;m more interested in writing than science.<br />

I like your comment though, it was really interesting. And I will have to remember it is December 21st, not 31st. Thank you for correcting me.</div>

I like your comment though, it was really interesting. And I will have to remember it is December 21st, not 31st. Thank you for correcting me.</div>I actually did all the math like a month ago because I was bored, wanted to know how much energy I&#039;d release if I&#039;d meet a copy of myself in antimatter... It would basically destroy the Earth and have a lot of leftover energy to cause more damage.<br />
<br />
A little about antimatter: As the name implies, it&#039;s the negative form of matter. Instead of being made of Protons (Positive charge) and Electrons (Negative Charge), it&#039;s made of Antiprotons (negative charge) and Positrons (positive charge). When an anti subatomic particle, like a Positron, meets with it&#039;s regular subatomic counterpart, it annihilates, meaning it disappears, along with the other one, releasing all of the energy stored in those two particles (Which can be calculated in Joules using E=mc[sup]2[/sup]) You then just have to convert the amount of Joules released into kilotons and you&#039;ve got the approximate power of the atomic blast it would create. Luckily, we don&#039;t have the technology to create enough of it quickly and even less the technology to maintain and store it, as it would annihilate with it&#039;s container. We&#039;d basically have to build a container made of Neutronium (or Nilium), a  particle made only of Neutrons, which don&#039;t have an electromagnetic charge. (I&#039;m not sure if they have an antimaterial counterpart, so that&#039;s my best bet.)<br />

How I learned about it? I read a book, a manga actually, called &quot;BLAME!&quot; (It&#039;s a mistranslation, it was supposed to be called BLAM!) It&#039;s basically the destroy of a guy in a post-apocalyptic world, trying to save humanity and his only weapon is an antimatter gun.

The LHC is the Large Hadron Collider. It&#039;s a huge underground ring built under the frontier of France and Switzerland, near Geneva. It&#039;s a particle accelerator, meaning it uses magnetic coils to speed up atoms in this circular tunnel (Which is in a vacuum, so there are only a few atoms there) and speeds up others in the opposite direction. When they collide, they&#039;re going at 99.9999991% of the speed of light. Because of the vacuum and all, and also because they are trying to replicate the Big Bang&#039;s coditions, it&#039;s temperature is maintained at 1.9 degrees Kelvin. Just to give you an idea, the temperature in outer space is 3 degrees Kelvin. When the atoms collide, for a fraction of a second, it&#039;s extremely hot. So in other words, it&#039;s a factory to create antimatter and try to replicate the conditions of the Big Bang.It&#039;s also the coldest AND the hottest place in the universe at the same time, and houses the man-made machine closest to firing an object at the speed of light.<br />

Things like these are why I love science :3 (But I see what you mean when you say you&#039;re more interested in writing than science; I&#039;m like that sometimes, too, believe it or not :P) I tried to make it simple, as if you look this up on Wikipedia it&#039;s like the people who wrote the article built a scientific barrier that repels anybody who isn&#039;t a Doctor in physics... Luckily, my physics teacher in year 10 and 11 was that awesome and told me all about it :P</div>

What is y2k?

@Kube
I have this strange feeling that you have been wanting to share piece of information for a very long time, but have never be able to properly apply it to at topic, or it could just be me.

I have never heard of antimatter before. Where did you learn about it?

And what is LHC? I wish I knew these terms, but sometimes I&#039;m more interested in writing than science.

I like your comment though, it was really interesting. And I will have to remember it is December 21st, not 31st. Thank you for correcting me.[/quote]

I actually did all the math like a month ago because I was bored, wanted to know how much energy I&#039;d release if I&#039;d meet a copy of myself in antimatter... It would basically destroy the Earth and have a lot of leftover energy to cause more damage.

A little about antimatter: As the name implies, it&#039;s the negative form of matter. Instead of being made of Protons (Positive charge) and Electrons (Negative Charge), it&#039;s made of Antiprotons (negative charge) and Positrons (positive charge). When an anti subatomic particle, like a Positron, meets with it&#039;s regular subatomic counterpart, it annihilates, meaning it disappears, along with the other one, releasing all of the energy stored in those two particles (Which can be calculated in Joules using E=mc[sup]2[/sup]) You then just have to convert the amount of Joules released into kilotons and you&#039;ve got the approximate power of the atomic blast it would create. Luckily, we don&#039;t have the technology to create enough of it quickly and even less the technology to maintain and store it, as it would annihilate with it&#039;s container. We&#039;d basically have to build a container made of Neutronium (or Nilium), a  particle made only of Neutrons, which don&#039;t have an electromagnetic charge. (I&#039;m not sure if they have an antimaterial counterpart, so that&#039;s my best bet.)

That is the coolest thing I have ever heard of, the LHC. I had never heard of it before. So they are trying to build a model of the big bang theory? Hope nothing goes wrong, or else France is toast!
