We all love to throw around ideas like the subconscious but its from a specific paradigm and showing it exists is nearly impossible even if we find the idea helpful in explaining certain things.<br />
<br />
As far as most religion being astrological and controlling, me thinks someone took the Zeitgeist Movie a little too seriously. I&#039;d be willing to grant you that it created a non-political hierarchy(that eventually got into politics) but any astrological influences probably weren&#039;t as strong as you&#039;d like to believe.</div>

Religion to me is just belief on a grand scale of millions or billions of people. The unity of that one belief. And as was stated belief in itself is a fabrication seeing as today you believe one thing and the next day you believe another. As for religion there have been numerous amounts of religions threw history. One dominates one<br />
century/decade another the next and so forth.<br />
<br />
So if you belief one thing today and another thing the next day, What you previously believed is false.Therefor making belief in itself false. And if religion is belief on a much bigger scale, then that make religion just a much bigger false. False meaning Not True or if you like Lie. <br />
<br />
The previous was just a little spin i liked to put on it as to the why and not the what. But more practical would be human instinct as the basic need of security in life after death. The need for love and the need for self-authentication, just quickly going of Maslow&#039;s hierarchy of needs. Admittedly the idea of being part of something bigger is appealing to most people and as people age comes the what is next. This idea of being part of something bigger is the heart of where religion is born and all organizations, cults, secret society&#039;s and any other groups you can think of.</div>

The clips you have linked are collectively the first part of a conspiracy film called Zeitgeist. Part II deals with the US Federal Income tax and III with 9/11. The whole thing is one of the poorer efforts on the all topics it attempts, but it does create a clear stream of thought making it seem true.<br />

I&#039;ve no problem with people calling religion oppressive bullshit, I enjoy listening to George Carlin do it should I happen across a video I&#039;ve seen numerous times  of his performances. However, rather than heeding his advice to think for yourself, your content to accept content on youtube as the nail in the coffin for a discussion.

I would agree much of popular religion exists in the lessor aspects of spiritual interest. Prayers for Health, Wealth, and Power all miss the point of the message and in some cases are directly argued against. (In Kabbalah the only &#039;proper&#039; prayer is for god to grant you the strength to endure his tests: be it sickness, poverty, violence, oppression or some other worldly ill.) There are plenty of Ideas out there, to abandon them due to popular usage is rather like judging a book by the cover.. most of them didn&#039;t read it either.<br />
<br />
Your free to believe whatever you like, but you&#039;ll always still believe something. How do you plan to beat that problem? Its all spin.</div>

Religion is about power and purpose, plain and simple. people want life to have meaning, and some give other&#039;s meaning in order to have meaning in there own lives, power being their meaning.
