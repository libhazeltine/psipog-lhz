		<div id="post_7481" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Auras are something that have interested me for a long time. I think they can be important when learning more about human emotion too. It has been debated about over the past few decades (what it is). It is mentioned in one of the videos below that giving something a scientific name (like &quot;biofeedback&quot;) and giving it a system of measurement becomes more acceptable by people like scientists. Is it the life force?(psi, whatever). It seems that concentrating will increase the size and intensity of the aura, and different emotions will give different colors. If there was a more advanced camera, (say, one that could read arua without human touch) then you could make a construct in front of it, and see if anything shows. If nothing were to show, then could it mean that an alternate &quot;energy&quot;(in application to psionics) besides psi exists? Some psionics websites have said that only one energy exists, but if two existed, (similar to the story of Dynamo jack in the videos section) maybe it could be manipulated to different effects. <br />
<br />
But we dont have a camera like that, (as far as I know) so it seems we can only speculate.<br />
<br />
Here is some stuff I found on that topic:<br />
<br />
An interesting article that relates the placebo effect and auras together<br />

		<div id="post_7486" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I haven&#039;t read those links because I don&#039;t have the time.  I will read them when I can, but I just wanted to quickly give some info. about my own experiences with auras.<br />
<br />
There have been times I have tried to read auras, and some of those times I think I was successful. I tried to get my mind to look at the person (I only tried it on people) and try to really look at them, not just normal looking at them.  Then, a coulered sort of &quot;bubble&quot; would appear around them.<br />
<br />
Someone I know had a program on his computer that is supposedly able to read different meridian points in the body, to show if there could be health problems.  It worked by having a thing that looks like a pen put into the USP port, and it is then touched to different parts of the hands and feet, and it registers as a number on the computer.  I do not know if it is accurate or not, but it did show consistent results with the same people.  I would like to get someone who has a known medical problem to try it out, and see if it is accurate in detecting it.  <br />
<br />
I tried to find a link to a website about the &quot;aura reading machine&quot;. I was unable to find it, but I did find something similair:<br />
 <a href="http://www.divinespiritchurch.com/aura_imaging" target="_blank">http://www.divinespiritchurch.com/aura_imaging</a><br />
<br />
To me, however, the one that the person I know had seemed to be more believable than that one.<br />
<br />
I just try to keep an open mind about everything.  Until I am able to know for sure rather or not auras are real, I will not say either &quot;yes they are&quot; or &quot;no they are not&quot;.  Even though I have seen them before, I am still not going to form a conclusion.  Sometimes even seeing is not believing, at least for me.</div>

<br />
Especially note one of the symptoms listed: Feeling separated from one&#039;s body.<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder if perhaps Epilepsy and Migraines could be connected with parts of the brain used to perceive auras.  This is simply a hypothesis I just thought of, don&#039;t take it as anything more or anything less.<br />
