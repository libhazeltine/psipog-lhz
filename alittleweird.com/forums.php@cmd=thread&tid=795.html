		<div id="post_14400" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey guys!<br />
Ghosthunting might be one of my favorite weekend hobbies. I&#039;ve been to almost every haunted, or supposedly haunted spot in Massachusetts and many across New England. I am also a musician, and I have literally hundreds of songs of my friends singing drunk in my basement on junk tracks that I never ended up using. <br />
A couple of weeks ago I went out with a friend of mine who is very sensitive. We went to a cemetery in Vernon, Connecticut. While there was no physical activity at the site, the both of us felt a very strong presence in the center of the cemetery near a chapel. At one point we distinctly felt something pass through us at the same time. We both agreed that we felt two particular entities in the area, and that they did not want us there. <br />
We eventually decided to leave to get dinner and come back at dusk. When we got back we drove into the cemetery and still felt the same distinct feeling. We noticed that I had one of my CDs in my car with a particularly BAD music track where a very drunk friend of mine yelled satanic messages to a horrible eurotrash techno beat. In a very uncharacteristic move for myself (I generally have the utmost respect for the dead and the haunted places that I visit) we decided to BLARE the music around the chapel where we felt the strongest energy. We drove around with my stupid drunk friend screaming &quot;I AM SATAN, I AM THE DEVIL, BOW TO ME&quot; into a vocal distorter that made him sound...well...like the devil. <br />
Immediately after we got and walked around again. The engery that we felt was gone. There was no feeling of being watched, none of that spiritual heaviness or any of the negative energy we felt before. <br />
My theory is my horrible eurotrash techno beat and my stupid inhebriated friend exorcised whatever was in that graveyard. We plan to make a trip back down there in the near future to see if whatever was there returned.<br />
So...I was just looking through the website and I figured I&#039;d share that unusual story. <br />
Thoughts? Feelings?</div>
