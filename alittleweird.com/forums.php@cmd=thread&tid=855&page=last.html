Now here is where this debate gets interesting.<br />
Biblically, we were created &quot;in God&#039;s image.&quot; If so, then why would we be an entirely different state of existence.</div>What I&#039;m about to say assumes the existence of the christian God, and that certain biblical points would have to be true, for the purpose of the theory.<br />
<br />
Christianity holds that God is in everything.  So in order for that to be true, God would have to span accross all existing matter and energy.  In that sense, God would take the shape or image of all existing matter and energy, right? <br />
I&#039;m going to speculate that all matter and energy that exists is in the shape of a sphere, because of the big bang theory; explosions tend towards the shape of a sphere when not acted on by external forces and when energy is evenly distributed, which it is theorized was the state of all energy when the big bang occurred.  After all, most stars, planets and moons tend towards a spherical shape - it is, for the most part, a common shape seen throughout the observable universe.  <br />
So then, if God takes the shape of all existing matter/energy because he is within all existing matter/energy, and all existing matter/energy is indeed the shape of a sphere, then God&#039;s shape or image would be a sphere.<br />
<br />
So a spherical christian God creating man in his biped image still wouldn&#039;t seem to be man being created in the image of God, as we are not spheres.  However, when one takes into account that a human, in its first stages of development, is a single cell, and that a cell in its most perfect form with no external forces acting upon it, along with even distribution tends to be a sphere, maybe there we can see how man may have been created in the image of God, if God first created man as a single cell.<br />
<br />
This theory, of course, assumes A LOT, such as the current state of matter/energy within our universe and the certainty of certain biblical principles, but it&#039;s always fun to speculate, isn&#039;t it? As the christian God is no longer just a creator, and other components are added to his existence, particularly components of existence within our universe, then those components as they apply to our universe and existence would probably have to comply with the rules and reason of our universe in order for us to perceive them, right?<br />
<br />
Ah let me know what you guys think, and please remember this theory assumes the existence of a God and various other ideologies.  If you are to address it, please address it accordingly - this is not a religious debate, this is a philosophical proposition regarding religion, assuming certain aspects of the religion are true.  Be mature guys, if you cannot be open minded to the theory, or at least think of it in perspective, please refrain from addressing this theory.</div>

I&#039;ll just point this out as a semi-counter-argument-thingy-whatever-the-hell-it-is: When humans, whatever their god is and be its existence true or not, tend to perceive their deities as human-like beings. The Christian god was, in fact, pictured as a human. This is also true for the Romans, the Ancient Greeks, etc. etc. That being said, though, there&#039;s always the fact that the Ancient Egyptians pictured their gods as anthropomorphic beings, half-human, half-animal. Animal gods also apply to other religions.<br />
<br />
The Ancient Greeks actually revered things like the ocean, death, war, nature and even the primal chaos. They took those concepts and gave them personality in order to picture them better.<br />
<br />
But since this is about the christian god creating us in its image, I&#039;d like to say this (For the Christians who absolutely believe in creation out there, don&#039;t take offense, this is purely objective.): Humans shape their gods in their own image and the Christian god is no exception.<br />

<br />
I thank each of you who responded to my post for your maturity.  I will now move on to what I wanted to say with regards to your posts, however I always appreciate it when people can discuss sensitive issues without letting the sensitivity of the issue get the best of them - thank you again.<br />
<br />
One of the many obstacles in objectively discussing the bible, as it pertains to creatinism and Christianity, is how people choose to read it.  Some prefer a strict, word-for-word understanding of the bible while others see the text in the bible as interpretive, or to be looked at with the understanding that the bible was written in a different culture and age from that which we currently exist (in most cases).  <br />

<br />
With regards to your second point, perhaps God is not <em>in</em> everything, but it&#039;s generally understood that the Christian God is (at least) everywhere.  I took the time to locate a biblical verse pertaining to the issue:<br />
&quot;In Jeremiah 23:24 God declares, &#039;Do I not fill heaven and earth?&#039;&quot;<br />
In a very physical context, if God is, or &quot;fills&quot; everywhere in a spherical universe, God&#039;s existence, at least as it relates to the physical existence of our universe, would be spherical, would it not?<br />
<br />
Ah well let me know what you think buddy.<br />
Anyone else too, but I must say that this biblical conversation will soon come to an end on my part, as although I enjoy discussing sensitive topics maturely, one can only spend so much time on thin ice ;)</div>

I thank each of you who responded to my post for your maturity.  I will now move on to what I wanted to say with regards to your posts, however I always appreciate it when people can discuss sensitive issues without letting the sensitivity of the issue get the best of them - thank you again.

First, you must have to remember that religion is not a theory. And second, you must alos have to remember that we do have proof that God exists. And, he even became man to tell us that he existed.<br />
<br />
Also, God was not pictured a human. We use Jesus Christ to represent God, because he is the &quot;God-Man.&quot; God became man, and that is why we use Jesus Christ as a symbol, because he is indeed a &quot;God&quot; as it were.<br />

Not ALL mind you, but plenty of scientists would argue that science disproves religion.  People should consider that they could be two seperate languages for the same thing.  Also the circumstances in which life as we know it exists are SO specific that the odds of it happening on its own are almost impossible (I say almost because I too keep an open mind to the idea)<br />
<br />
 For example: If anyone is familiar with the term &quot;strong force&quot; it refers to the strength needed for two protons to bond within an atom, because according to physics, they should repel one another being of the same charge.  If that amount of force was of by .0000000000000000001 then protons would NOT bind to form atoms, therefore we would not have water, and therefore life would not be POSSIBLE.<br />
<br />
Kind of suggests that something lended a helping hand doesn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
As for my own beliefs on the 2012 phenomenon, I believe more along the lines of a spiritual/psionic/energy etc based awakening.  I tend to shy away from the collective consciousness theory because it reminds me too much of a &quot;hive&quot; mind.  The Mayan calendar only ends because it is the end of this age, the next age being described by the Mayans as the &quot;Golden Age.&quot; <br />
<br />
Personally that doesn&#039;t suggest an apocalypse to me.<br />

I went of on a bit of a rant there, its been a while since I&#039;ve been in the forums, so thanks to anyone who took the time to read it. :-P</div>
