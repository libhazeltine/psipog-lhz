  Don&#039;t understand what I&#039;m saying?

Get a piece of paper and write out all the things you beleive are true about telekinesis, like, for example:<br />
<br />
1. Moving bigger objects is harder.<br />
<br />
OK, common sence tells you that it should be harder to roll a pen than to spin a wheel. But wait! We are talking about the paranormal here.In order to roll the pen you need to beleive that it&#039;s easier than the psiwheel.And why shouldn&#039;t it be? Is it really that hard for your brain to roll a single pen? Even moving your muscles takes more effort than that. Just think about it.And most important, beleive it!<br />

2. Levitating objects requires lots of skills and practise<br />

Once again, you probably think that levitating is really hard.In fact,it&#039;s not! (Hell yeah,I&#039;ve done it).You just need to convince yourself it&#039;s easy as fuck and if you truly beleive it you&#039;ll levitate your first piece of paper in no time...<br />

 I can go on and on giving you examples but by now you should have figured it out - If your beleif is strong, there&#039;s no limit to the things that you can do.Remember --reality defines normality :P<br />

Its easier said than done. Theres a lot of effort involved in breaking down a mental barrier like that.<br />

Also. You left out how to practice, different ways to practice, when to practice, how much to practice, how to structure the practice, etc..Those are all important things.

I don&#039;t have the link to the actual experiment, but you can read about it in the chapter &quot;Breaking the system&quot;.<br />
<br />
The experiment I&#039;m talking about is the experiment where Randi got a fake psychic to appear on the radio and pretend to send &quot;mysterious vibes&quot; through the radio to affect spoons or other household items, to try and disprove Uri Gellers ability. And in that experiment strange things did happen to people. Without any practice or training. <br />
<br />
If someone has a link to the actual document experiment that would be great.<br />
<br />
With physical skills practice is certainly a must. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not so sure about psionics.<br />
<br />
EDIT: After thinking it over a bit more thoroughly, I have thought about the concept of control. The people in the experiment didn&#039;t have control over what they did (if they did it). If they wanted control, they would probably have to practice. But to what degree? Where do you draw the line on how much? I think it would be like riding a bike, you never forget.(though you become less skilled over time)</div>

<br />
If it didn&#039;t work for you, and you honestly believed, then I could say that you needed more belief for it to work. You would believe more, and try more, but it might work, and it might not.  There are 2 things here that almost seem to contradict.  <br />
 <br />
1: Practice is necessary for psionic achievement.<br />
<br />
2: That you don&#039;t need to practice in order to achieve, rather belief is necessary.<br />
 <br />
<br />
One of those is dangerous to think, but I believe that you can combine them. <br />
I believe changing your beliefs about practice can change what you can do.I believe that if you believe that you must train in telekinesis for 10 years before moving something the size of a calculator, then that will be the result. But I also believe if you believe marginal practice is all that is necessary, then you will only need marginal practice.  <br />
<br />
I think, now anyway, that you should practice enough to let yourself adapt to what you are doing, but I also think that believing that practice can be very flexible is important too.</div>

		<div id="post_14265" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The problem with this way to achieve psychic abilities it the mental barriers. These hard rock pieces of belief system that limit the way you react and perceive/feel stuff are the Enemy (or kind of: is you actually).<br />
That&#039;s one of the reasons I think that children can learn these skills faster.<br />

There are 2 things here that almost seem to contradict.  <br />
 <br />
1: Practice is necessary for psionic achievement.<br />
<br />
2: That you don&#039;t need to practice in order to achieve, rather belief is necessary.</div>That&#039;s no paradox rather kind of a chain reaction: Let&#039;s suppose that it&#039;s actually the belief that counts and you start believing that your psiball will flash like a disco light ball. So to determinate if that&#039;s true you&#039;ll try making a a psychic disco ball. You believe it therefore you succeed. Hold on a moment! You actually <strong>practiced</strong>, or <em>did</em> it.<br />
Now let&#039;s have a practical case scenery: You make so you believe then you try. It don&#039;t works. You ask yourself about your beliefs &quot;Old vs. New&quot;. Now you really start to process the new beliefs at new level. It don&#039;t works. You think that your new belief is wrong. Okay: you never believed it deeply enough (usually you don&#039;t have concrete hang points to support your new belief apart from &quot;someone wrote about it on the Web&quot;). Still you like to make invisible psiballs and try again. You notice a light brightness. Maybe it&#039;s just the light bulb&#039;s reflection on the floor, but you did not realised. Wow! let&#039;s make that over and over again. You became so fixed to the idea of it flashing that one day it makes light ovals on the ceiling. Great you did it.<br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_14265">The problem with this way to achieve psychic abilities it the mental barriers. These hard rock pieces of belief system that limit the way you react and perceive/feel stuff are the Enemy (or kind of: is you actually).
That&#039;s one of the reasons I think that children can learn these skills faster.

There are 2 things here that almost seem to contradict.  
 
1: Practice is necessary for psionic achievement.

2: That you don&#039;t need to practice in order to achieve, rather belief is necessary.
[/quote]

That&#039;s no paradox rather kind of a chain reaction: Let&#039;s suppose that it&#039;s actually the belief that counts and you start believing that your psiball will flash like a disco light ball. So to determinate if that&#039;s true you&#039;ll try making a a psychic disco ball. You believe it therefore you succeed. Hold on a moment! You actually [b]practiced[/b], or [i]did[/i] it.
Now let&#039;s have a practical case scenery: You make so you believe then you try. It don&#039;t works. You ask yourself about your beliefs &quot;Old vs. New&quot;. Now you really start to process the new beliefs at new level. It don&#039;t works. You think that your new belief is wrong. Okay: you never believed it deeply enough (usually you don&#039;t have concrete hang points to support your new belief apart from &quot;someone wrote about it on the Web&quot;). Still you like to make invisible psiballs and try again. You notice a light brightness. Maybe it&#039;s just the light bulb&#039;s reflection on the floor, but you did not realised. Wow! let&#039;s make that over and over again. You became so fixed to the idea of it flashing that one day it makes light ovals on the ceiling. Great you did it.

<br />
Perhaps &quot;practice&quot; is not just in the skill itself, but our beliefs as well. After all, we are learning to think in a new way that applies to the skill. Physical training for example, may suggest you learn about nutrition as something to help you along that road. It no doubt will help, in one way or another, but not everyone has to do it (Michael Phelps anyone?).<br />
<br />
Psionics is similar. Whether you believe a space god is giving you your psionic skills, or that it comes from some magic stone, you will certainly have to <strong>apply</strong> yourself to the task of doing something. Even with a &quot;space god&quot; belief, you can still hold beliefs about how you go about doing something.<br />
<br />
What might this lead to? It might lead to psychological techniques to help you handle these skills. Of course if you believe some physical action has to take place in order for things to work, then surely, the mind is what expects it, and may subconsciously (or unconsciously) take action, and produce results.<br />
<br />
I still think that practice and belief must intermingle as well as be side by side. This may sound like a cliche &quot;balance&quot; idea, but it is the most I can make sense of it at this moment.<br />
<br />
Anyone can have a custom diet, healthy or not, And anyone can have a custom belief system, healthy or not. You can nonchalantly go about and ignore the idea as well, and just go with it. (Though this may be hard at first because many believe they don&#039;t know how to do psionics in the beginning)<br />
<br />
Even if we are &quot;unlimited&quot; in a certain skill such as this, there may be a setback of sorts. Think of a sport, say...rock climbing. You can go and get better over time by continuously practicing the skill (Ideally). However, can we call it rock climbing after a certain point? If you are able to climb a route nobody in the world can do, and crawl to the top in 2 seconds, can you really call it that anymore? (come to think of it, can you be called human even?) I think, after a certain amount of skill in a skill, that the skill changes, into something we may not be able to do. In this case, &quot;rock climbing&quot; becomes &quot;super strength&quot;. Psionics (I believe) has the same sort of limit, although I don&#039;t know what to call it once it goes beyond that.<br />

Nobody knows how the magic &quot;really happens&quot;.We only have pieces of truth to sew together.But when you realize something you truly beleived in is wrong, it&#039;s hard to let go.I still think that you should doubt most of the stuff you beleive in. Don&#039;t beleive in the space god until you have proof.But by the time you get that proof, how will you move on? Well,we have 1 fact:[i]Science can&#039;t explain everything.[/i]It&#039;s more like a gap that you can fill with all kinds of faiths, hopes and the likes...

And the same way it&#039;s hard to let wrong beliefs go it&#039;s also hard to choose only the healthy ones. Anyway, how can you tell if one belief is right or wrong at the beginning? I think it was Shakespeare who said that there&#039;s no such thing as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, is the person in cause and his/her experiences that make the decision.</div>
