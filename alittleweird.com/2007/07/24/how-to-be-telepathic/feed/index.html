It seems that you are touching on some debates inside of existentialism and transcendentalism.  These are very fascinating subjects and have been the topic of debate for hundreds of years, if not longer.

This is the underlying idea behind this telepathy post (again, correct me if I'm wrong, Sean):

There is an energy in the world that is mostly invisible.  Some cultures call it Chi, or Psi, or something else.  This energy flows through everyone and everything, as we are all ultimately "made" of the same physical atomic material.  This energy can be used to transfer ideas, can be physically manipulated, etc.

Some people perceive this energy more than others.  Some are too programmed to not accept this as a possibility.  Some are born with it, others learn it later.

Sean's example in this post plays off of this energy, in getting in tune with the energy and thoughts around you.</description>

		<description>It is my opinion that our will is not DETERMINED by our experiences.  Certainly our experiences have a huge factor.  But there is a thread of pure original consciousness that only you have.  Now how often do we actually exercise this pure original thread of consciousness?  The older we get, the less we use it, and the more we become programmed and scripted by our habits and experiences.  But it still exists.

Just my opinion on the subject.  I'm no authority on how reality functions.  Reality may or may not agree with me :-P.</description>

		<description>So... let me see if I'm getting this.  My understanding is that this belief is not telepathy in the "popular" or "occult" sense of the word (I'm the last person that should define the occult sense of the word telepathy, but I guess if I had it it would be communication without any of the five basic human senses.  Like I said, I could be way off).

Anyway, It sounds to me like this belief is more along the lines of the use of careful observation and empathy to forecast another's actions.  In other words, if I can place myself in your exact position, including knowledge of past events, then the thoughts regarding the future that are generated by MY mind should be similar to the thoughts generated by YOURS.

Additionally, you're saying that while our minds are essentially the same in generating thoughts, free will still exists.  So while thoughts generated by my mind should resemble yours, I may perhaps choose one path while you would choose another, depending on our will.

If I have all of this right, then my question is this:  Is my will determined by my experiences?  In other words, in the above example where you and I would choose different paths based on our different wills, is this because I only empathized with your position and did not actually experience it?  Had I experienced your past first-hand, would I in fact choose the same path as you, or is there another factor that affects our decision making?  Our individual "souls" perhaps?

It's a monster of a question.  Are we all a part of one conglomerate consciousness where our differences are all just a matter of environment and experience?  Or (obviously hypothetically) if each of us were born and raised under exactly identical conditions (same environment, same genetic make up, same influences), would there be originality?  Just curious I guess…</description>

		<description>There's an episode of Futurama where Bender meets God (or the remains of a space probe that crashed into God)...

Bender: Do you know what I'm going to do before I do it?

God: Yes

Bender: What if I do something different?

God: Then I don't know that.

...

I love that episode.</description>

		<description>That is my current belief, yes Jesse.

There is no conflict between free will and determinism.  I outline an example in the "Lottery Project" page, under the section "The Philosophy".  http://alittleweird.com/the-lottery-project/

Ultimately, it is impossible to predict the future (according to my current understanding).  The act of prediction means that the world IS deterministic.  But if I "predict" that I'm going to shower in 20 minutes, and then I actually go shower in 20 minutes - is that a real prediction?  You would argue: no, of course not.  Why not?  Because I made a choice to shower.  We can't predict the future, but we create the future with our choices, so it can look like prediction.  And we can make intelligent guesses as to what choices we're going to make to give the illusion of prediction.

If I know where you are, and I know where you've been, and I know the direction you're facing - I can make a pretty damn good prediction on where you're going to be.  And I can be correct 99% of the time.  Ultimately, I can't know 100% though, because it's your decision.

		<description>I had these same thoughts at first.  After all, if you can "tell the future," that means that the future is already written.

Doc Brown would advise otherwise.

Sean's method is not telling the future, even though it may appear to others that way.  What it is is perceiving the choices others are making.  You are not perceiving a definite outcome in the future, you are perceiving others choices and their exercises in free will.  Since their thoughts are formed before they verbalize them, sometimes long before, then you can beat them to the punch :)

Taking it a step further, through the lens of SR, there are no other people, only your single consciousness.  However, free will and choice are still the backbone of the idea.  "You" are choosing what both "you" and "others" are doing, because there is really no difference.  The only thing that exists is free will.

Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, I don't want to put words in your mouth.

		<description>The bit on the future threw me off a bit. While certainly related to mind, it brings me a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, because of my constant conflict with whether or not free will exists. 

My personal belief is that my thoughts were just "created" by me, and that it was just that simple, but now that I've been more exposed to the scientific world and see that even our minds can be explained by science, I feel my sense of free will fading away.
 I find that all my thoughts are linked to something else in a very direct way, like having seen something earlier. I think my ADD tendencies helped avoid that sort of thought at an earlier time, but because I'm becoming more focused, it's becoming more of a problem.

 It seems to me like one of the most assumed concepts, free will, is a supernatural idea. and that scares me.</description>

		<description>Interesting..
I'm sort of confused though. 
If you understand your own thinking process well, it makes sense that you could understand other people's thinking process (although to the point of telepathy seems hard to comprehend). But you talk about being able to sense the future. Could you elaborate how thats linked to being aware of yourself?</description>
