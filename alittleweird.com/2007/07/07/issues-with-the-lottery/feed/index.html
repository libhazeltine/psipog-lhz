		<description>i don't think its cheating at all.  LOA is about getting what you want because you want it.  And lets face it your not the only one out there that wants to win the lottery.  They all visualize and put energy into it even if there not aware of it.  Just because you are aware of it doesn't mean that your cheating.
Sometimes i think that maybe we are thinking about it to much.  You know the phrase "A watched pot does not boil".  When ever i can buy the  tickets and then just forget about them until a day after the drawing i get better results. 

When you watch those programs you find that a lot of people who did win did exactly that.  One woman was talking to her friends regarding the fact that a recent lottery winner in there area had not come forward yet.  She said "Oh if I had the winning ticket I wouldn't be waiting all of this time.  I would be down there cashing it in.  What she didn't realize is that she did indeed have the winning ticket on her visor and she just hadn't checked it yet.</description>

		<description>As far as the "something for nothing" issue, here's one way to look at it; although work is usually thought of as something done to earn a living, if you were to win the lottery, you wouldn't have to worry about money. You'd probably have enough to support you for the rest of your life. What you'd be left with is a whole lot of time. Then there's a lot more possibilities, such as volunteer work or starting your own buissiness or organization. Pick a noble cause, any noble cause :)</description>

		<description>In response to war1025: Beautiful idea. I completely agree.

There's always the daunting question (in my mind) of whether the rest of the world exists or is simply in my head. I might ask someone if they're real, but maybe my mind's playing out a conversation for me. (I guess this is a Matrix idea...) There's absolutely no way to prove it. And this is sort of my approach to randomness. 

To Sean: I don't know how much this borders on religion, so sorry, but I was wondering if you believed in Karma or anything remotely similar.</description>

		<description>In a world without randomness *nothing* can be random. In that case, everything is sorted out already and you could know what would happen from here to eternity. The only problem with that is, even if it is all worked out, without randomness, knowing everything about the future would not help you to change it. Randomness is the ability to effect change on the world. Without randomness you can't change anything. 

It's like a book. Are we writing it, or reading it? Are all the letters down on the page? Or are we putting them down as we go? If they are already written out, we can know what will happen, and knowing it may make us want to change it. But wanting to change it will do nothing because we have seen the future that is written out in black and white. 

If there is randomness, we can't see the words on the next page. We can infer what they might be, but we cannot know them. 

Here is a thought I had a couple years ago, possibly influenced by my experiences with psipog...  

What if the universe/time is like a large sphere. We are at a certain point on that sphere. Time is the movement over the sphere, top to bottom in my mind. In this way, every possible combination of space/ time would be represented. Through our actions we determine the path our lives take on this sphere. In this way, you can steer the course, but you cannot jump to a radically different experience. You must go through the motions.

An interesting point I thought of from this concept: Every single one of us could be taking a different path. Because the sphere provides for every possible occurrence, you would exist on a certain area of the sphere. This is every possible action you could take in your life and where it would lead. In places where your area overlaps with others, you exist with them. If every person chose their own destiny, they could in effect take a different path on sphere. It's crazy to think about, but what if every single person is living in an alternate reality and the people we interact with are just reflections of what they could have chosen. We have no idea which one they actually did.

I just think that is very interesting / powerful.</description>

		<description>FI
__  (G) = M
 T

Seems to me (The O'l man) you just need yourself a formula. I use this one:
Focused Intentions over Time, multiplied by God, equals Momentum.
It works on so many levels... but hay, that's ME.</description>

		<description>Very good post.
Sometimes you confuse me though ;).
But I think I get the point. 

It feels like your getting closer and closer to winning. I hope you win within the next month :) !!!.
Please keep us updated.

ALSO!!!:
Will you ever make a chat room again? I loved #psipog.

		<description>Wow... I would say that your motivation is slowly starting to fade =O. However, I like the approach you take - you at least try to stay moral, and are aware of the possible implications on society if everyone was able to win the lottery.
But heck - seeing as YOU work hard, thinking through possible scenarios, trying to find out the nature of reality, and attempting to clear up some of those human mysteries that have followed us thousands of years - you are doing work.
Me personally, I believe that you're working, and thus justifying the morality of the jackpot. You may be doing it in a way different than most humans, but then again, we're not most humans in the way we think and believe things.</description>

		<description>the reason you lost is probly because you feel bad about having an advantage, it always works like that... do what i do, dont think about the money or people when you play, just think about it as a game, 
if you win the game, great, if you lose, great, sure it would be great to win the lottery but you can live without it,
and i have to ask sean.. how many numbers did you get right?</description>
