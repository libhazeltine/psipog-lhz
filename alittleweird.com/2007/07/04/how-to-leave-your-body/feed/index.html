		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is how, and I'm absolutely positive of this, I got my first kinda-sorta WOAH! experience.  I was absolutely obsessed with leaving my body, and one night I could call the vibrations, at will even.  I laid down and raised them, raised them, amplified them, it felt as if my whole reality was being torn apart, and that scared me (although the roaring shaking vibrations might have helped).  The night after I could only get the vibrations half of what I could the night before, and after a week I couldn't feel them at all, no matter how hard I tried.  The obsession with leaving my body was gone, and I don't know why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still frustrated with myself over that, and I can't get into OBE's anymore, even though that's all I really came to this site for... Was to get some more material on OBE's so I could get back into that obsession.  I knew that was the key to leaving my body, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to do some searching and I hope I can get back into the groove I had a year ago.  I think I'll go try some of the techniques that I used before, now.  Maybe they'll work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just spewing all this text out from the top of my head, and it just hit me...  All of my thoughts now are "maybe, kind-of, sorta, if" thoughts.  Before, they were "I can do this!, Monroe knows what he's talking about!, Wow I can really leave my body!" thoughts.  I have to re-make the transition, but now I'm more of a skeptic than I was before, so it might be harder for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, it might not be totally healthy to get rid of all skepticism, and that might be what's holding me back from having a total OBE experience.  I think what happened when I got that jolt, when I was laying on my bed (which I know for a fact was completely real, I was completely awake and my heart was beating for hours afterward, couldn't get any sleep that night) was my mind was looking for excuses as to why it couldn't be happening.  What if Monroe was wrong?  What if Robert Peterson was just trying to joke the internet up?  What if all the people who say they've had OBEs really didn't, and they are only following the "formula" of blue sparks, shocking vibrations, silver cord etc just to fit in with the rest of the crowd to feel more valid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was slowly convincing myself that I could NOT have just had that strong vibrational feeling that scared me half to death.  To this day half of me says it's impossible and half of me says it happened.  And I don't know what to do at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, Sean, for posting this, it may just be the thing to get me back in the groove. I’m gonna search google for more stuff to read, more testimonials, but I think I’m trying to force this into my head, and my skeptic inside is resisting, and I don’t know how to get him to shut the heck up &gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much ranting, I'm gonna leave it at this.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>One time I had a random OBE and I knew I was in it. I then proceeded to use some Psi and I got a visual. It's like I could physically see my Psi forming but its not my eyes but rather my consciousness :p anyways I've tried to do that again and I couldn't. this article reminded me of that time and I really want to try that again. thanks for posting it!

		<description>Over the long weekend (canadian) I managed to read through Robert peterson's web book that you link every now and then.

Since then I've made great progress, I've got to a point where it felt like I was disconnected from my body, I couldn't feel my libs or torso and it just kinda felt like I was floating. I got too excited with 'waaa I'm doing it' and last it short after before trying to move out of the body but what an experiance that was on it's own!</description>

		<description>"Had I had a burning desire to leave my body, then even the part of myself that felt it was necessary to guard a juice maker would have wanted to leave."

This manifested in several of my dreams. I had a few weeks where about two or three times a week I would wake up out of some screwy dream situation back in my body in my bed, with exit symptoms. One of them I actually started to leave my body from the dream, and I can tell you, it did not feel dream like at all. 

I really should get back into that zone, I don't know why, but right when I was making the most progress I lost it. Back to work!

		<description>Still havent been able to have one, but quick question. After a full-night OBE do you still get the benefits of sleep? Thats what i'm worried about, because i already am short a couple hours every night (5-6:30 hrs/night except weekends)</description>
