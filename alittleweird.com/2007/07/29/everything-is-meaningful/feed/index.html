		<description>Jav, there is no "our universes."  Everything you see and hear and read and experience is in "your universe."  Me typing this is not an external person somewhere at a desk with a keyboard, it is inside of you, as is the chair you're sitting in and the screen you're looking at and the neighbor you spoke with earlier and the people on the tv screen.  And yes, even the 9/11 victims, terrorists, families, reporters, buildings, airplanes, theories, dissenters, and soldiers.

That's one theory, anyhow :-]</description>

		<description>Interesting post, Sean... a couple of thoughts about it:

I guess I sort of agree that everything has meaning. Even though i don't find that belief that much empowering. It already starts with the amount of data you could interpret. If everything has meaning, then.. well.. I sort of have to/could interpret all sorts of things. Basically every 5 minutes of reality bear some sort of deeper wisdom that you might uncover that lead to new decisions. But well.. new decisions every 5 minutes? I have even trouble to keep up with all the things that I decided a week ago.

Then the question of interpretation. As war1025 pointed out, there are quite a number of possible interpretation for any given situation. I often read blog posts like: 'It is all clear to me know, this means this and that' and then a day later: 'oh, I had it figured out all wrong.. instead it meant that and this'. You could say that it's maybe not that important whether the interpretation is 'right' or 'wrong' as long as it is 'valuable'. But then again: If it is only about coming up with smart insights and fitting those onto the data that you have, you can also look at tarot cards.. at least it is no longer an argument for why everything should have meaning. (If you give meaning to everything of course everything has meaning then).

And then finally: It's a whole bunch of blame to take. =) Blame to take for all those significant and insignificant things that go wrong in my life. And what about things like 9/11? Did my beliefs about reality made this happen? Or wait.. 9/11 happened in your universes as well, didn't it? ;-P</description>

		<description>Yes, I saw a toad in the middle of the road after over a decade of never seeing one anywhere in the area. Ever.</description>

		<description>Thanks for everyone's continued comments.  This topic interests me because I believe I can use it to win the lottery.  Your thoughts provoke different lines of questioning, which is always helpful :-).

		<description>I've been wanting to reply to this post and the last one, but I've been busier than usual, and I can't seem to find the right words to say...

You have to be careful with this sort of thing though, so that you don't trick yourself into seeing what you want to see. If you look hard enough for something, you will find it. I'm not denying that everything has meaning or that things happen for a reason, I'm just saying that sometimes you take all of the signs, and interpret them to support some aspect of yourself that you really wish was true. 

When you described the rubiks cube thing, the explanation that came to my mind was this:

You have a rubiks cube in your car, representing a challenge or a problem. All the stickers fall off. You say it represents that you find an alternate solution to the problem. What it says to me is, the opportunity for solution is gone. The key that would let you put things right again, and solve the problem, has been lost. So where you see it as a problem that you have solved unconventionally, it seems to me that it is a problem whose time has passed, and which can no longer be solved.

As for the toad thing, I think it just means you saw a toad in the middle of the  road...</description>

		<description>This sort of concept is something that should seem really obvious, but most people never point it out. One could argue, " Of course it has meaning, everything happens because of something else. "

 I have extreme anxiety when it comes to being in public and would often ignore physical needs so I wouldn't draw attention to myself. I recall a situation when I forced myself to do some things just to break habit and fear. When I was waiting outside a class that day, a big black beetle was standing in the middle of the hallway. I was sitting there, staring at it, when it suddenly ran straight at me, and I jumped up out of it's way as it ran right where I was sitting. I can't deliver a clearer explanation because I don't know exactly what else I was going through at the time, but dodging a beetle attack by jumping straight up quickly was a small accomplishment of what I was trying to achieve.

Another occasion was during this summer but a little back story is needed first. I've been trying to have OBEs for a long time to no avail, and keep getting discouraged from having them. I used to like toads and frogs a lot when I was younger, and would play with wild ones when I would go out of town, but couldn't when I was at home because there were none in this area. A book I often get lost in lately features a lot of frog monsters as part of a evil prophecy. 

So one night I was walking my dog, thinking about OBEs, when I saw a toad in the middle of the road. I moved it out of the road, and thought that it was a sign that I could OBE. I still haven't had one as far as I know.

 Any ideas as to what that one could mean?</description>

		<description>Hehe, hey war, this is from a different blog post I made earlier today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that I live, I look back one year and say "Damn, I didn't know shit last year." Next year I'm gonna look back at today and say "Damn, I didn't know shit last year." It's comforting to be absolutely sure that I don't know shit. Otherwise there would be too much pressure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maybe we're connected, too !!!</description>
