		<description>while this IS a good list.. ill still sound like a cultist trying to convince people :P 

ah well.. 

even though i do believe in this stuff.. im starting to not really care if other people think its real or not, i dont need validation,
i dont need to gratify my ego or get a chub by telling people this stuff is real.. only a negitive outcome will appear if i keep trying to convince people..
you should hope people stumble across some type of psychic book and become interested by themselves.. hell thats why im here,

you cant build someones belief system for them.. tell them whats real
all you can really do is supply the parts.</description>

		<description>I think it's just the doors that things like this open. In the minds of many of the so called "enlightened" individuals, science has explained everything in the world, and we now know basically everything. Everyone in our past was "ignorant" of reality, but we are suddenly all-knowing.

... If only they knew how wrong they were. That seems to be the funny thing about the life, The more you know about something, the more there is to know. There are always the subtle nuances of life, which at first glance don't look so big, but turn into vast canyons of uncharted territory. 

Admitting that one of the "fake" things is real opens up the probability and reality that the other "impossible" things are indeed not only possible, but commonplace. That scares some people, so they refuse to see it happening. Even the people who experience such things spend hours on end trying to explain it away any way they can. The idea of the unknown makes us feel tiny and powerless. People don't like that.</description>

		<description>Indeed. A good list full of good advice.

But still one cant but wonder whether we are actually trying to prove this stuff to ourselves by proving it to others?
After all, if one man believes something he is considered to be deluted, when a group of men believe in same thing they have a cause.

Once I learned just to keep my mouth shut and my nose to the grindstone I have lost my "need" to try and prove my beliefs and practices to the people around me, especially those unwilling to accept them. My ultimate results shall speak for themselves once they are realized. Until then, my efforts are best kept where they benefit me the most.

After all, aren't we all after some kind of validation?

Just my thoughts about this whole proving-scene.</description>

		<description>Certain people are stuck in a belief system they called "skepticism". Thats what they call but its really just cynicism, closed mindedness, basically a religion of scientism (not science mind you). The first rule of true skepticism is having an open mind, if you have an open mind you will most likely get results that are "weird".</description>

		<description>Wow, I wish we'd had this list when Psipog was still running. It would have weeded out a lot of pointless and repetitive discussions. 

Quite the list.

		<description>Sean,

At the next reunion, I want you to spin a pinwheel on my coffee table.  If you don't, I'm going to punch you in the mouth for obviously lying to me all these years!  And how dare you use simple imagery to illustrate points that may be complicated.

:)

I hope those guys at the other forum don't ruffle your feathers.  I'm sure they don't, as you've probably encountered much of the same in years past. Keep up the good work and don't get frustrated.  HOLLA!
