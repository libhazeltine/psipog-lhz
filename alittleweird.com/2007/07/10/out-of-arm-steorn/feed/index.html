		<description>I actually have these 'out of arm' things every few months. I actually just had one two nights ago.

For me, its mostly with only one arm. I'll wake up in the middle of the night to find my arm refuses to move. When I try to move them, it feels like they're moving, but in reality but my physical arm doesn't budge.

Its quite interesting when you pickup a dead arm with a functional one, and put it down. Scary too, considering I could break my own arm and not feel it.

I always blamed it on lack of blood flow (such as my arm sticking directly up in the air when I sleep)</description>

		<description>The truth is, that Free energy does infact exist. It was tested in Mythbusters. In one episode they tried to create free energy (or harness it I guess). Well they searched the web for it and found a few machines. Most didn't work but one did. It sucked energy from the cosmic radation of the universe and converted that to electricity. Unfortunatly it only proved like a decimal of a watt. Not enough to actually be usefull. But overall they considered the myth "busted" because if the impracticality of the device.</description>

		<description>ClearVision:

A lot of assumptions about reality can turn out to be wrong. Theories build upon each other. We can only see a portion of the whole picture at a time. We draw assumptions (or "laws of physics") out of nessecity with the knowledge we currently have but our understanding will always keep growing. So, keep an open mind. Modern science does not have all the answers, not yet anyway and perhaps it never will.</description>

		<description>In response to war1025: Even science acknowledges that your mind can do weird things. Of course, no self-respecting scientist would tell you that, because they can't explain how. But, the fact remains: certain scientists definetly proved that "some unknown force" exists. They just can't link it to the mind/consciousness yet, much less explain how it is created and how it works.

On the contrary: Free energy is deemed as nonexistent by all of science, and history has taught us that a great deal of free energy claims have been hoaxes and bluffs. Some have just been a plain failure, where the engineers admitted it at the end. So either Steorn is trying to get energy from something, or the machine is a bluff. I take it the machine is just an energy converter and is highly efficient at converting magnetic/mechanical energy into electromagnetic energy, meaning the energy is NOT technically free. But, who knows what comes out of this once the engineers finish. I remain hopeful, but with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially now that one of their experiments failed.

Cool out of arm experience!!! I've never gotten an OBE, partially cause I'm too lazy to practice :P. But oh well... Eventually I'll get there.</description>

		<description>I started to make a comment about the "out of arm" experience, but it turned into a dirty joke so I erased it.</description>

		<description>What happened to the 22 scientists that where working on proving/disproving the steorn technology?</description>

		<description>*sigh* Was that 16 minutes of straight excuses? I was only kind of paying attention. :P I personally don't believe such a machine is possible, but if they make one I won't be bashing it. 

And like Gumby the only time I've had an arm OBE was when I wasn't looking. I tend to trance with my eyes closed, so it's harder to prove it to myself.</description>

		<description>"It’s starting to get kind of ridiculous to see so many people try over and over to achieve an impossible thing."

Isn't it though... I mean moving shit with your mind and forcing yourself to win the lottery... way out there and definitely impossible.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results, right?

		<description>Heh... At first I was actually convinced Steorn could do it but now I'm seriously doubting it. And even if they create a free energy machine, investors won't take them serious anymore after this first failure. 
It's starting to get kind of ridiculous to see so many people try over and over to achieve an impossible thing. I'll make up my mind when they finished the last presentation (probably with failure). But I've seriously lowered my expectations of the company, if they don't manage to get all the parameters right for the machine the first time ("The lighting caused it", "Ball bearings caused it", "We don't know what caused it"). I'm gonna stay a skeptic for now.</description>

		<description>First comment again!! I had an out of arm experience too a while back. I was trying to have an OBE if I remember right, and I gave up so I tried to move my arm, when I moved my OBE arm instead. My eyes were still closed but I could feel where the arm was like you said, but I realized I never moved my real arm after.</description>
