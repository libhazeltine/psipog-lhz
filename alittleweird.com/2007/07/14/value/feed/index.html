		<description>Darn, I was just told about this little debate taking place on that site not that long ago. It looks as if it's over and done with, but if it continues, I'll gladly partake in the debate :-)

Good post, Sean. I remain an avid reader :-)</description>

		<description>I think it is very important for people to try to look beyond advertisements these days.  So much of our lives are exposed to ads that we have no control over (or do we?  cough... subjective reality... cough) that it is necessary to look at the purpose for them.

I remember "Bowling for Columbine" where Michael Moore interviewed Marylin Manson.  Manson talked about the importance of fear on television: "buy this pimple cream or the girl won't fuck you" or something like that.

Good stuff, Sean.</description>

		<description>I don't know how effective it'll be to win the lottery, but you're absolutely right about the mind creating value. I've personally tossed out toys that I couldn't be seperated from as a kid. Why? They no longer had value to me. I have the memories, they are enough. The toys themselvs no longer held any value, despite the fact that they were no different than when I got them.</description>
