			<div class="entry">
				<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of learning to communicate with your subconscious mind.  How does it work though?  Are we really speaking with our subconscious mind?  How can we test it?  What explanations are there?</p>
<p>I believe our minds have a function to &#8220;tune into&#8221; a personality.  We can do this in a minor way, by simply asking ourselves, &#8220;What would Bethany think about this?&#8221;  But we do this in a major way all the time - I believe our current personality is simply a result of this &#8220;tuning&#8221; process.  When I act things out, I am asking myself the question of, &#8220;What would Sean think about this?  How would Sean react?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you may complain that what I&#8217;m describing is very unlikely, because we ARE our personalities.  How is it that we tune into ourselves?  I AM Sean&#8230; I don&#8217;t ask myself, &#8220;What would Sean do?&#8221;, I just DO what I want to do.</p>
<p>I disagree.  If I tell myself that I am Sean, then I run into some problems trying to explain some things.  However, if I tell myself that I am something else, and I tune into the Sean personality, then a lot of things make sense.</p>
<p>How does channeling work?  How do people have multiple personalities?  How do we communicate with our subconscious?  If my personality changes over time, am I still me?  Ultimately: who am I?</p>
<p>Have you ever become fed up with your personality?  How can that be?  Who are you at that moment&#8230; your personality, or the something that&#8217;s fed up?</p>
<p>This idea of tuning into a personality solves a lot of questions.  In channeling, the psychic starts to behave as though they are some other personality.  We can easily see how that&#8217;s possible in the theory I&#8217;m outlining.  The psychic simply tunes into the desired personality, and acts out whatever that personality decides.</p>
<p>For people with multiple personalities: one explanation is that they can&#8217;t lock onto one personality like the rest of us have, and their tuning process is out of control.  They involuntarily jump from personality to personality.</p>
<p>For communicating with the subconscious, I offer a similar explanation.  We build this idea of who and what our subconscious is, and then we tune into that.  The question becomes, &#8220;What would my subconscious think about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation offers some solutions to common enigmas.  For example, if I can communicate with my subconscious, and you can communicate with yours&#8230; and we both ask our subconscious about something, and they contradict each other&#8230; then who is right?  Who is wrong?  What is the explanation for how the subconscious mind can be wrong about something?  In the past, I offered the explanation that there was a miscommunication (which is still possible), but now I offer another explanation as well: we have simply tuned into different personalities, and the personalities disagree.</p>
<p>You may ask: how is it that we receive psychic information from these personalities?  The subconscious is more than just a personality in our head&#8230; it can deliver psychic information that can&#8217;t be known otherwise.  The same argument holds for channeling.</p>
<p>I offer the explanation: we are psychic.  We already have the information.  We simply need the personality to express the information to ourselves in a format we agree with.  Our beliefs about reality force us to experience the information through the personality instead of experiencing it directly.  After all&#8230; why do we ask our subconscious about things?  Because we believe the subconscious knows something we don&#8217;t.  We tell ourselves that we can&#8217;t possibly know some factoid, so we must experience it through communicating with a personality outside of our own.  We tune into the personality that best represents our definition of what &#8220;subconscious&#8221; is, and prepare ourselves to receive the information we already know about.</p>
<p>WWJD?  &#8220;What would Jesus do?&#8221; (for a klondike bar?).  Another example of personality tuning.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to share this link that I&#8217;ve had stored away for a long time.  It&#8217;s an exercise for &#8220;borrowing&#8221; someone else&#8217;s genius.  Basically, the question becomes, &#8220;What would a genius think?&#8221;, and develops an exercise for tuning into this genius personality.  <a href="http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm">http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm</a></p>
<p>I may write on this topic some more, because I feel as though I&#8217;ve just skimmed over it.  Any questions, feel free to ask.</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;I offer the explanation: we are psychic.  We already have the information.  We simply need the personality to express the information to ourselves in a format we agree with.  Our beliefs about reality force us to experience the information through the personality instead of experiencing it directly.  After all… why do we ask our subconscious about things?  Because we believe the subconscious knows something we don’t.  We tell ourselves that we can’t possibly know some factoid, so we must experience it through communicating with a personality outside of our own.  We tune into the personality that best represents our definition of what “subconscious” is, and prepare ourselves to receive the information we already know about.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Along the same line of thinking I believe that our &#8220;subconcious&#8221; represents our higher self/potential/goal for who/what we wish to become. If you&#8217;re ultimate goal of fulfillment in defining who and what you are is an ideal of a person that who and what you are right now does not match, then the subconcious might represent that goal &#8220;personality.&#8221; Whenever you are faced with a question or decision or experience you can choose to simply move through it as you are now (i.e. without change/growth/etc) or you can choose to move through it by asking how personality X would do it&#8230; the personality you choose to resonate with may be your higher/goal self, it may be someone else you admire, it may be a spiritual master (wwjd, wwc(hrist)d, wwb(uddah)d, wwtdd, etc).</p>
<p>I think this loops back nicely into the idea of choice and reality construction. Who and what do you choose to be? With every thought, action, choice, experience, who or what do you choose to resonate with and exemplify? The potential is infinite&#8230; the only limit is what you choose to believe you can or cannot do and how diligent you are about making those choices.</p>
<p>Two books that touch on the subject a bit are <em>A Course In Miracles</em> and <em>Conversations With God</em> (by Neale Walsch). They both come from a semi-christian viewpoint, but ultimately speak outside of specific religion and concentrate on just ideas as opposed to dogma.</p>

			<p>Similar to this idea.. In &#8220;Think and Grow Rich,&#8221; Napoleon Hill talks about how he mentally created counselors in his mind. First, he just wanted to subconsciously obtain the traits of famous men such as Edison and Lincoln, so he would create a mental image of them and talk to them in his head. Eventually though, these mental characters started to develop their own personalities and began to give him advice and information he otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have known, and according to the book they went so far as to save his life a few times.</p>

			<p>It sounds reasonable enough, but what about when your subconscious says things to you without you thinking about it? For example, once I was going to school, and just as I was walking out the front door, my subconscious said &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your maths book!&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about any of my books, or whether I&#8217;d forgotten any of them. In fact, I was deep in other thoughts at that moment.</p>

			<p>Had you forgotten them? Mine, if it is that(I&#8217;m beginning to think it&#8217;s something I conjured up in my head to help me deal with self esteem issues)hasn&#8217;t done anything like that, but it is a classic example of things that happen. Little urges, which I HAVE felt, are also common, such as, &#8220;Drink this instead of that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wondering what happens if your personality is aimed at becoming godlike, or nonexistent? I don&#8217;t think anyone has achieved godlike yet - so there are limits that we&#8217;ve still to figure out. Or maybe, it&#8217;s this implied notion of limits that actually limits us. Ughh&#8230; I&#8217;m confusing myself. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> Nonexistent probably means you don&#8217;t have a sub-c. Would be cool to meet such a person, with them aware of everything including psi&#8230; Godlike? Might mean that the person is aware of nothing, but feels everything. Like being in a perpetual coma, sorta.</p>
<p>But yes, in general I agree. You are what you want to be. The same law that capitalist society teaches us daily :P. I just don&#8217;t like the idea that it&#8217;s so simple and straightforward (my own personal reasons that I don&#8217;t want 6.3b to know). Tuning in? Conflicting personalities? Different people in one head? Sounds a lot like the definition of schizophrenia. Maybe that&#8217;s how people get mental illnesses, like you described. The &#8220;tuner&#8221; is effed up. Heh. Throwing the anti-psychology movement a bone :rolleyes: .</p>
