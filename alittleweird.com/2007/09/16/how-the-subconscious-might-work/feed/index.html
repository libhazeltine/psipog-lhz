		<description>Wondering what happens if your personality is aimed at becoming godlike, or nonexistent? I don't think anyone has achieved godlike yet - so there are limits that we've still to figure out. Or maybe, it's this implied notion of limits that actually limits us. Ughh... I'm confusing myself. :P Nonexistent probably means you don't have a sub-c. Would be cool to meet such a person, with them aware of everything including psi... Godlike? Might mean that the person is aware of nothing, but feels everything. Like being in a perpetual coma, sorta.

But yes, in general I agree. You are what you want to be. The same law that capitalist society teaches us daily :P. I just don't like the idea that it's so simple and straightforward (my own personal reasons that I don't want 6.3b to know). Tuning in? Conflicting personalities? Different people in one head? Sounds a lot like the definition of schizophrenia. Maybe that's how people get mental illnesses, like you described. The "tuner" is effed up. Heh. Throwing the anti-psychology movement a bone :rolleyes: .</description>

		<description>Had you forgotten them? Mine, if it is that(I'm beginning to think it's something I conjured up in my head to help me deal with self esteem issues)hasn't done anything like that, but it is a classic example of things that happen. Little urges, which I HAVE felt, are also common, such as, "Drink this instead of that."</description>

		<description>It sounds reasonable enough, but what about when your subconscious says things to you without you thinking about it? For example, once I was going to school, and just as I was walking out the front door, my subconscious said "Don't forget your maths book!". I wasn't thinking about any of my books, or whether I'd forgotten any of them. In fact, I was deep in other thoughts at that moment.</description>

		<description>Similar to this idea.. In "Think and Grow Rich," Napoleon Hill talks about how he mentally created counselors in his mind. First, he just wanted to subconsciously obtain the traits of famous men such as Edison and Lincoln, so he would create a mental image of them and talk to them in his head. Eventually though, these mental characters started to develop their own personalities and began to give him advice and information he otherwise wouldn't have known, and according to the book they went so far as to save his life a few times.</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;"I offer the explanation: we are psychic.  We already have the information.  We simply need the personality to express the information to ourselves in a format we agree with.  Our beliefs about reality force us to experience the information through the personality instead of experiencing it directly.  After all… why do we ask our subconscious about things?  Because we believe the subconscious knows something we don’t.  We tell ourselves that we can’t possibly know some factoid, so we must experience it through communicating with a personality outside of our own.  We tune into the personality that best represents our definition of what “subconscious” is, and prepare ourselves to receive the information we already know about."&lt;/em&gt;

+1

Along the same line of thinking I believe that our "subconcious" represents our higher self/potential/goal for who/what we wish to become. If you're ultimate goal of fulfillment in defining who and what you are is an ideal of a person that who and what you are right now does not match, then the subconcious might represent that goal "personality." Whenever you are faced with a question or decision or experience you can choose to simply move through it as you are now (i.e. without change/growth/etc) or you can choose to move through it by asking how personality X would do it... the personality you choose to resonate with may be your higher/goal self, it may be someone else you admire, it may be a spiritual master (wwjd, wwc(hrist)d, wwb(uddah)d, wwtdd, etc).

I think this loops back nicely into the idea of choice and reality construction. Who and what do you choose to be? With every thought, action, choice, experience, who or what do you choose to resonate with and exemplify? The potential is infinite... the only limit is what you choose to believe you can or cannot do and how diligent you are about making those choices.

Two books that touch on the subject a bit are &lt;em&gt;A Course In Miracles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Conversations With God&lt;/em&gt; (by Neale Walsch). They both come from a semi-christian viewpoint, but ultimately speak outside of specific religion and concentrate on just ideas as opposed to dogma.
