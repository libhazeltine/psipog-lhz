				<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>
<p>http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/08/a-better-life/</p>
<p>Enjoy, if you haven&#8217;t already seen it.</p>
<p>-Fred</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Sean,<br />
This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/faq.aspx</p>
<p>Later,<br />
~Maila</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!</p>
<p>Im a big fan of u!!!<br />
I like very much PsiPog and ALittleWeird!!!<br />
I read every day your blog!!!</p>
<p>But&#8230; i need a little help&#8230;</p>
<p>I know u say that telekinesis is real&#8230; in ur blog&#8230; many times&#8230;<br />
but&#8230; i need to make this question direct to you&#8230; by this email&#8230;<br />
and i want a sincere reply&#8230;<br />
because im trying 6 months&#8230; and nothing&#8230;<br />
now&#8230; i dont know if this is real and keep trying&#8230; or if this is a bullshit and give up&#8230;</p>
<p>Telekinesis is real???<br />
If is&#8230; can u tell me some tips?</p>
<p>Tks in adv.</p>
<p>Ur big fan&#8230;<br />
Frank</p></blockquote>
<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>
<p>in pychcology (a cource in our highschool),   our class tryed to learn to read these little cards with stars and circles on them and send them to each other telepathicly and the to best two people would do it together at the end of class in front of everyone. unforunately im not in my telepathic buddy&#8217;s class <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> but if i was we totaly would have stomped everyone into the ground and won.) anyways i just thought you&#8217;d find it pretty awsome that we actually got a chance to show off our telepathy skills in front of everyone in school.<br />
your friend,<br />
brad<br />
P.s. did you get arrested for graffitting that sign? lol</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean,</p>
<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there , i;m from poland and i read all of your articles day by day . YOU MAKE MY WORLD BETTER !<br />
thank You !</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank YOU!  And you&#8217;re welcome! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;m honored to have helped in some way.  Now stop feeding my ego&#8230;! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

			<p>Hey, thanks for keeping us in mind, Sean.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that the video board didn&#8217;t take off. At least it is there as a tool though, and it is always pleasant to find something new posted.</p>
<p>Well, Utah approaches in a few days <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> I hear it is already getting pretty cold out there&#8230;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child&#8221;</p>
<p>This does actually have a pretty simple explanation.</p>
<p>Humans don&#8217;t normally use the full power of their muscles.<br />
It does restrict them at a pretty low level, I think it was<br />
around 15%&#8230;</p>
<p>This is because the muscles actually can&#8217;t withstand their<br />
own power&#8230; They more or less self-destruct if used fully,<br />
being torn and basically broken so badly they can&#8217;t be used<br />
any more.</p>
<p>Therefore our sub-conscious restricts our muscles.<br />
But in some situations, our sub-conscious decides that<br />
there is more risk in NOT using the full power.<br />
This is why people in desperate situations can show a<br />
surprising amount of physical powers.</p>
<p>You might in some way be able to circumvent your<br />
sub-conscious to letting you use this power at a daily<br />
basis, but this will not be very advisable, as it<br />
probably will render your muscles unusable in a matter<br />
of hours, if not minutes&#8230;</p>
<p>I have to admit that I&#8217;m not a doctor, nor do I have<br />
any experience in this matter.<br />
It is all based on texts I have read in magazines, books<br />
or on the internet, and conclusions made by me.<br />
It would probably pay of to look it up on the web&#8230;</p>
