		<description>"I once read a story about a father who got
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child"

This does actually have a pretty simple explanation.

Humans don't normally use the full power of their muscles.
It does restrict them at a pretty low level, I think it was
around 15%...

This is because the muscles actually can't withstand their
own power... They more or less self-destruct if used fully,
being torn and basically broken so badly they can't be used
any more.

Therefore our sub-conscious restricts our muscles.
But in some situations, our sub-conscious decides that
there is more risk in NOT using the full power.
This is why people in desperate situations can show a
surprising amount of physical powers.

You might in some way be able to circumvent your
sub-conscious to letting you use this power at a daily
basis, but this will not be very advisable, as it
probably will render your muscles unusable in a matter
of hours, if not minutes...

I have to admit that I'm not a doctor, nor do I have
any experience in this matter.
It is all based on texts I have read in magazines, books
or on the internet, and conclusions made by me.
It would probably pay of to look it up on the web...

		<description>Hey, thanks for keeping us in mind, Sean.

It's unfortunate that the video board didn't take off. At least it is there as a tool though, and it is always pleasant to find something new posted.

Well, Utah approaches in a few days :P I hear it is already getting pretty cold out there...</description>
