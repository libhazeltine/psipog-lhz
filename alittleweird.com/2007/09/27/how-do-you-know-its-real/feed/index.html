		<description>What else could telekinesis be said to be other than intent manifestation?

It can be measured that our brains aren't sending any particles, rays, waves between itself and the target object. There is no material link
that could be measured using tools of modern physics. + The energy output of our nervous system just doesn't match up with the results seen in target object. There just isn't enough energy to do what telekinesis does. So the phenomenon cant be about sending energy. 

And if our act of intention has no way of interacting with it's target, then the act itself must cause the effects.</description>

		<description>I think the relationship with interpretation of intention manifestation and interpretation of reality should be delved into a little more myself (bobelly's post got my thought gears turning as well).  I mean from the sounds of it, it's like reality is a script that is read through over time and if we can access that we can go ahead and rewrite parts of the script.  I should note though that I don't have much experience personally in telepathy or intention manifestation.   I'm just a lazy speculator :P</description>

		<description>With relation to Bobelly's post, it is my belief (and just my belief) that intention manifestation doesn't work in the same way when it involves other people and their own will. I think (as I wrote on a previous post) that every person's will is like a physical force that can move situations and events, and so these events and situations go the way it's easier for them to go to, like flowing water.
But who knows! Maybe someone with more experience with intention manifestation would say something different!</description>

		<description>if you believe in intention manifestation, isn't it possible that by confidently "predicting" other people's emotions/actions, you're actually creating them (instead of truly predicting them)?</description>

		<description>Real? How is any of this real? Reality ain't real. What we're doing is breaking the physical laws. I don't know. No one can know. It's just like memory - you can attempt to explain your experience, but you can't really convey the experience 100% the way you felt it (unless, of course you use telepathy :p ). 
Reality... isn't real. Real doesn't exist, at least not in my mind. There's just the present. There, unstable, constantly changing, going through an infinite number of possible states, then your mind choosing one.</description>

		<description>I hate to say it, but I often become so bored with the predictability of a conversation or situation that is already scripted in my mind, that I find myself purposely eliciting responses in order to steer people in the direction of my choosing.

I normally end up pushing buttons for my own amusement, and then calling people out when they feebly attempt to hide their true emotions or reactions. What never fails to entertain is the look that crosses people's faces when you dictate back to them their exact thought process and exactly how they are feeling regardless of the face they have put on. It's usually written in their eyes/body language.

I am often angry with myself for taking advantage of others in this fashion. I never gain anything from it, though, except for a short detour away from boringsville...</description>
