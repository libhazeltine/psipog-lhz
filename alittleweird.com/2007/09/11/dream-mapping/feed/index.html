		<description>mhhh, there is this book I've been talking about in another comment, by J.H. Brennan, Astral Projection.

He says that dreams are created of the same "material" than dreams or lucid dream.
He further states, that there a different bodies, the material body, the ether body, the astral body, the spiritual body, etc, etc., each of them packed one in another like those Russian puppets.

If you leave your body in an OBE, you are in your ether body, but take all the "other" bodies with you. When you go even further and leave your ether body, you are leaving this world and enter the astral world, a parallel world to the our earth, with a consistent form. Remembering your Hyper lucid dream might be a key to find out if you were in the astral world.

I just can recommand you this book: http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Astral-Projection-Out-body/dp/1855381079/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8509417-5108646?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books&#38;qid=1189609610&#38;sr=8-1

See you.</description>

		<description>I can relate to what you are saying.

I have had an experience that kept my memory of the experience around 100% real. It was actually my very first attempt at lucid dreaming. I'm not sure how to classify the whole thing... I think it might be somewhere in between an OBE and an LD, but since I have never attempted an OBE, I might just be full of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a full retelling of the experience:

&lt;a href="http://questforlucidity.blogspot.com/2006/12/dark-descent.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;LD With Full Recall&lt;/a&gt;

Basically, I began using the WILD technique, and shortly there-after returned to my body without ever actually breaking the stream of consciousness. I could recall the experience as if it had just happened in real life with 100% clarity, and I still do today.

So I would have to assume that an unbroken stream of consciousness is the key to vivid recall as it commits the events to memory in the same fashion as normal experiences.

I think that the stream of consciousness while falling into sleep must be just as important as remaining conscious while waking up. I quite frequently remain conscious upon exiting my dreams, but never attain the same vivid recall as when sustaining consciousness on both entry and exit.

		<description>Very interesting. I know what you mean by it feels real and then after its over its "less" real (I assume you mean clear when you say "real"). Its sounds silly when you haven't done any of that before: how can you tell is was vivid then when you remember it as foggy or foggier now? Its hard to explain. Any way I know there are ways to improve recall for LD, OBEs and I'm betting hyper-real LDs as well. 
 
I've read (but I've never done it, I've only had one partial-separation OBE)that you can AP from an typical OBE so maybe you should try that and see if it is like the hyper-real LD. 

Here is a weird link that might help www.astraldynamics.com with that.

Also, would you mind describing your hyper-real LD a little better because it sounds fascinating.</description>
