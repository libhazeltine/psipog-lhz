		<description>Looking at what I just typed I think your old deserving theory might have some basis Sean.  I would think that the only variable distinguishing who gets something and who doesn't, besides the degree in which someone wills the event (if it can be measured to a degree) would be on who needs it most.  I don't know, just me thinking out loud. :P</description>

		<description>Me=Plan-&#62;Think-&#62;Replan-&#62;Think some more-&#62;Speculate on the outcome-&#62;Tell someone else-&#62;Let them do it.

Honestly, if intention manifestation is about emotion then I know quite a few people who would be unintentionally trying to manifest lottery wins.  My grandma gets really pumped about it, though I don't think she's ever won anything.

Honestly what you're trying to do kindof sounds like the old Bill Cosby joke where everyone at the black jack table is praying "Please let it be an ace, oh lord let it be an ace" or "God, I know your a good god, and if you could just make the next card a three..." and God just says "Bust everybody!" (of course in this case you would replace prayer with intention manifestation and god with the universe or reality)</description>

		<description>I just hate the lack of logic in this field.

Trying to produce an effect with our minds feels like trying to write a computer game with C++ with a compiler that would only say if the code is OK or not. No error numbers, no lines, no correction suggestions. Just YES or NO.

These things tend to work the same way too.. Either you get results you want, or you dont. And the feedback is good as nothing. 

No wonder one gets frustrated? 

Normally any problem solving or skill building woukld go like:
Plan -&#62; Do -&#62; Evaluate -&#62; Fix -&#62; Redo -&#62; Evaluate -&#62; Fix -&#62; Redo

All we can do here is: 
Plan -&#62; Do -&#62; Do -&#62; Do -&#62; Do -&#62; Evaluate -&#62; Do -&#62; Do -&#62; Get frustrated -&#62; Quit.</description>

		<description>One thing I do know about intention manifestation from my own experiences is that it has everything to do with emotion. You probably got pissed because you were afraid to lose. If you have deep seated fear (no matter how small) of losing the lottery I'm guessing you will probably lose it and keep losing it. So, I think your intuition is right and you should try not to make it a big deal.</description>
