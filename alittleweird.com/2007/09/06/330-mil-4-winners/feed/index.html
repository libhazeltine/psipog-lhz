		<description>You know i was thinking just before the big drawing that no witches who are out of the closet have ever won the big one,  then what happens,  That Bunky Character gets a winning ticket.  Why can't winning the big one ever be that easy.</description>

		<description>Wow. Maybe you should read this: 
http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/wayoflife/09/13/lottery.nightmare.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview

Maybe you don't win because you don't deserve the misery? Dunno, sorta reversal of my impressions of what winning the lottery would be like...</description>

		<description>Perhaps instead of working with a continually changing number, you could crack RSA 2048. The prize for that is $200000. And, the number is available to all to try:

25195908475657893494027183240048398571429282126204032027777137836043662020           70759555626401852588078440691829064124951508218929855914917618450280848912           00728449926873928072877767359714183472702618963750149718246911650776133798           59095700097330459748808428401797429100642458691817195118746121515172654632           28221686998754918242243363725908514186546204357679842338718477444792073993           42365848238242811981638150106748104516603773060562016196762561338441436038           33904414952634432190114657544454178424020924616515723350778707749817125772           46796292638635637328991215483143816789988504044536402352738195137863656439           1212010397122822120720357

You could try to find one factor, and see if it divides the number evenly. If it turns out that both are prime, then you win.</description>

		<description>Sorry to put my own "spin" on intention manifestation but maybe this suggestion will help: From what I understand all thoughts, emotions, expectations blah blah blah will create. So, once you have your intention it will become reality as long as you don't "uncreate" it. 

Uncreation is caused by thoughts, emotions and expectations that conflict with the original intention. I'm a personal witness to this idea, sometimes I want something so bad that I'm completely focused on it and nothing can stop me but when I'm uncertain it usually either takes longer or doesn't happen.

In case you already don't you should write down your intention and also write why you want to win the lottery and how you know it will work- it helps. 

So, anyway, Sean, maybe you are simply uncreating your intention before its fulfilled. Its important to daily reaffirm your intention.   

My twobits. I also thought the secret was chalk full of empty drivel.  Secret to life my ass.</description>

		<description>i also like what you said about "people putting their own spin on something", and agree with it entirely. i mean, if someone didn't know what gravity was, and i told them that things fell to the ground because some great earth spirit wanted everything to be close to it, they'd probably believe me. my point here is, it's easy to observe something and come up with a reason behind it, but you can rarely ever know if your view is the right one. as Albert Einstein once said, "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."

i see it all the time in the views of religions, ancient cultures, stereotypical psychics, and even a little science. they all the see the same thing happening, but come up with very different reasons as to why it happens. ya never know hows right!


also, sean, i mostly agree on your views about randomness not existing, and that you can use that to win the lottery. but i don't think it's fair to say randomness doesn't exist at all, thus you shouldn't see someone else winning as you losing. 

(sorry if i'm rambling, or not really getting my point across clearly. it's 2am, i'm tired and have also had a bit to drink)</description>

		<description>What about the people who already won? Have you "studied" their methods? Do you think they tried intention manifestation? Or any other method that actually took a lot of effort? Or did it "just happen" for them?
Think about other things that seem nearly impossible to accomplish that seem to "just happen" once you ease up on the effort. Take PK or even something more common as finding something you truely believe is lost for good. Once you stop trying to "force" the wheel to spin or stop desperately searching every possible place for that lost item, it just happens. The wheel begins to spin with much less effort, the lost item just shows up, usually somewhere you swear you've already searched? 
Is there a possible connection? Just some food for thought.

		<description>Saw this thing on the news the other day, about one of the 4 lottery winners. Just thought you'd find it interesting.

I put it up on the video blog, but here's a little more text about it. (unfortunately, this was the only news clip I could find.)
So this guy claims he had the Wiccan gods give him the numbers, with the use of a number-generating machine "making it easier" for the gods to intervene. 

I personally don't believe in Wicca, but interpret it as you may.</description>

		<description>Some time ago I thought about winning the lottery with intention manifestation. Sometimes I think intention is almost like a physical force, where laws of physics would also apply. So what I thought was: things (events and stuff) would go in the direction where it's easier for them to go, and intention could affect this, making it harder or easier for things to go a way. 

So what stopped me from even trying to win it (well, I tried a couple of times) as thinking that if what I thought was true, then there would be so many people trying to win the lottery that their intention would be a massive obstacle, because it would be like a tug o war going a million ways. I don't know if that's true, but I still find it a very interesting and possible theory.

I also think if this is true then the person with the strongest will or intention would not necessarily be the winner, because so so many intentions might affect in strange ways.

Also, the closest I've ever got to winning the lottery was right after I was swindled (I hope it's the right word, English is not my first language), I was frustrated and annoyed, so I got a lottery ticket thinking "Hell, I deserve to win after this!". I won 3rd place! Funny thing is 3rd place for that specific lottery was $25, hahaha, so... But there was definetly something different about that time I bought the ticket.</description>
