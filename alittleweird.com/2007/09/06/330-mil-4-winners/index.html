			<div class="entry">
				<p>So anyways&#8230; I got one number correct on the big drawing last Friday.  There were four jackpot winners, who had to split the $330 million dollar prize money.  Pretty good chunk of change right there.</p>
<p>I notice that every time someone wins the jackpot, and it isn&#8217;t me, that I get really pissed off :-P.  Usually for about a week.  I don&#8217;t mind when nobody wins, because then I can just try again in a few days&#8230; but when someone wins, I can&#8217;t help but think that they did it correctly, and I didn&#8217;t.  So that bugs me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m continuing with my strategy of doing intention manifestation every day, for a set amount of time, and increase the duration by a minute each day.  Today I&#8217;m at 10 minutes&#8230; tomorrow 11, etc.</p>
<p>I started the lottery project in March, and it&#8217;s now September.  I&#8217;m at $1 profit.  I&#8217;ve destroyed the odds, and I should be in the hole quite a bit of money according to modern statistics.  For example, my dad started in April, and is at -$109 (though he does play a different lottery than I do).  Either way&#8230; my results prove that modern statistics is flawed on some level&#8230; but I&#8217;ve yet to take advantage of it&#8217;s flaws to win the jackpot.  (Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;prove&#8221;, because people get anal about that.  Oh well, bite me :-P.)</p>
<p>I have no choice but to keep going.  Part of me wishes I would just give up on it, and start focusing on other weird things (OBEs, PK, LDs&#8230;), so I would have more to write about :-).  But I can&#8217;t.  I know I can win.  It&#8217;s just that simple.</p>
<p>Reality, reality.</p>
<p>You know, when I finally do hit the jackpot, it still won&#8217;t answer any of my questions :-P.  By that I mean: I&#8217;ll be just as clueless as to how I did it as anyone else will be.  I find that funny :-).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that intention manifestation is also incorrect.  When I think about &#8220;<a href="http://thesecret.tv/" target="_blank">The Secret</a>&#8220;, my gut tells me there&#8217;s a lot of bullshit there.  But I also can&#8217;t argue with results&#8230; I&#8217;ve used intention manifestation techniques to do some weird shit that blew me away.  Hm.</p>
<p>What happens?  A truth is revealed, and then everyone jumps all over it, putting their own spin on it, promoting it as <em>their</em> truth.  Over time it becomes distorted, and the original truth fades out.  I fear that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening with intention manifestation.  Too many people thinking about it :-P.  Too many people forming ideas, and not enough raw perception.  I&#8217;m guilty as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how if you think about things a lot, and I mean really think&#8230; deep thought, focused, logical thinking&#8230; and you really stick to it, and draw wonderful conclusions, and come up with really beautiful and elegant ideas&#8230; that eventually you conclude that you think too much.  But you need to think too much to reach that conclusion.</p>

			<p>pretty sure the guys that won are just a few miles down the street here. dont know their names or anything, or if they are from here, but i do believe the ticket was sold very very close and i thought i heard the guy/guys were local. if i hear anything strange about the circumstances of the win ill let you know, but judging from the general populous of the area, i highly doubt its anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><em>What happens?  A truth is revealed, and then everyone jumps all over it, putting their own spin on it, promoting it as their truth.  Over time it becomes distorted, and the original truth fades out.  I fear that’s what’s happening with intention manifestation.  Too many people thinking about it :-P.  Too many people forming ideas, and not enough raw perception.  I’m guilty as well.</em></p>
<p>i like this. similar type of thing i believe &#8220;religions&#8221; were born out of. the secret smacks of that too. its a shame because, so far as i know, the general principle is functional and works, but when you promote it like its a toy, your &#8220;version&#8221; of it endorses using it for mostly material type gains, and its handed out like candy to anyone that wants some, that can be a sticky situation.</p>
<p>its tough because on one hand i believe that everyone has a right to seek truth and experience their full potential in life, so why should they NOT be allowed access to things like intention manifestation? if they choose to abuse it, that is their right. but on the other hand i believe these types of things are handled &#8220;better&#8221; in the hands of those that seek it, learn it and understand it. this leads to less abuse and usage that promotes more awakening, understanding and learning in others, rather than just padding your wallet and getting a new tv.</p>
<p>tricky.</p>
<p><em>&#8230;that eventually you conclude that you think too much.  But you need to think too much to reach that conclusion.</em></p>
<p>agreed. its also kinda like breathing, or eating, or &#8220;learning&#8221; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Some time ago I thought about winning the lottery with intention manifestation. Sometimes I think intention is almost like a physical force, where laws of physics would also apply. So what I thought was: things (events and stuff) would go in the direction where it&#8217;s easier for them to go, and intention could affect this, making it harder or easier for things to go a way. </p>
<p>So what stopped me from even trying to win it (well, I tried a couple of times) as thinking that if what I thought was true, then there would be so many people trying to win the lottery that their intention would be a massive obstacle, because it would be like a tug o war going a million ways. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true, but I still find it a very interesting and possible theory.</p>
<p>I also think if this is true then the person with the strongest will or intention would not necessarily be the winner, because so so many intentions might affect in strange ways.</p>
<p>Also, the closest I&#8217;ve ever got to winning the lottery was right after I was swindled (I hope it&#8217;s the right word, English is not my first language), I was frustrated and annoyed, so I got a lottery ticket thinking &#8220;Hell, I deserve to win after this!&#8221;. I won 3rd place! Funny thing is 3rd place for that specific lottery was $25, hahaha, so&#8230; But there was definetly something different about that time I bought the ticket.</p>

			<p>Saw this thing on the news the other day, about one of the 4 lottery winners. Just thought you&#8217;d find it interesting.</p>
<p>I put it up on the video blog, but here&#8217;s a little more text about it. (unfortunately, this was the only news clip I could find.)<br />
So this guy claims he had the Wiccan gods give him the numbers, with the use of a number-generating machine &#8220;making it easier&#8221; for the gods to intervene. </p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t believe in Wicca, but interpret it as you may.</p>

			<p>What about the people who already won? Have you &#8220;studied&#8221; their methods? Do you think they tried intention manifestation? Or any other method that actually took a lot of effort? Or did it &#8220;just happen&#8221; for them?<br />
Think about other things that seem nearly impossible to accomplish that seem to &#8220;just happen&#8221; once you ease up on the effort. Take PK or even something more common as finding something you truely believe is lost for good. Once you stop trying to &#8220;force&#8221; the wheel to spin or stop desperately searching every possible place for that lost item, it just happens. The wheel begins to spin with much less effort, the lost item just shows up, usually somewhere you swear you&#8217;ve already searched?<br />
Is there a possible connection? Just some food for thought.<br />

			<p>i also like what you said about &#8220;people putting their own spin on something&#8221;, and agree with it entirely. i mean, if someone didn&#8217;t know what gravity was, and i told them that things fell to the ground because some great earth spirit wanted everything to be close to it, they&#8217;d probably believe me. my point here is, it&#8217;s easy to observe something and come up with a reason behind it, but you can rarely ever know if your view is the right one. as Albert Einstein once said, &#8220;No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>i see it all the time in the views of religions, ancient cultures, stereotypical psychics, and even a little science. they all the see the same thing happening, but come up with very different reasons as to why it happens. ya never know hows right!</p>
<p>also, sean, i mostly agree on your views about randomness not existing, and that you can use that to win the lottery. but i don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say randomness doesn&#8217;t exist at all, thus you shouldn&#8217;t see someone else winning as you losing. </p>
<p>(sorry if i&#8217;m rambling, or not really getting my point across clearly. it&#8217;s 2am, i&#8217;m tired and have also had a bit to drink)</p>

			<p>Sorry to put my own &#8220;spin&#8221; on intention manifestation but maybe this suggestion will help: From what I understand all thoughts, emotions, expectations blah blah blah will create. So, once you have your intention it will become reality as long as you don&#8217;t &#8220;uncreate&#8221; it. </p>
<p>Uncreation is caused by thoughts, emotions and expectations that conflict with the original intention. I&#8217;m a personal witness to this idea, sometimes I want something so bad that I&#8217;m completely focused on it and nothing can stop me but when I&#8217;m uncertain it usually either takes longer or doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>In case you already don&#8217;t you should write down your intention and also write why you want to win the lottery and how you know it will work- it helps. </p>
<p>So, anyway, Sean, maybe you are simply uncreating your intention before its fulfilled. Its important to daily reaffirm your intention.   </p>
<p>My twobits. I also thought the secret was chalk full of empty drivel.  Secret to life my ass.</p>

			<p>Perhaps instead of working with a continually changing number, you could crack RSA 2048. The prize for that is $200000. And, the number is available to all to try:</p>
<p>25195908475657893494027183240048398571429282126204032027777137836043662020           70759555626401852588078440691829064124951508218929855914917618450280848912           00728449926873928072877767359714183472702618963750149718246911650776133798           59095700097330459748808428401797429100642458691817195118746121515172654632           28221686998754918242243363725908514186546204357679842338718477444792073993           42365848238242811981638150106748104516603773060562016196762561338441436038           33904414952634432190114657544454178424020924616515723350778707749817125772           46796292638635637328991215483143816789988504044536402352738195137863656439           1212010397122822120720357</p>
<p>You could try to find one factor, and see if it divides the number evenly. If it turns out that both are prime, then you win.</p>

<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t win because you don&#8217;t deserve the misery? Dunno, sorta reversal of my impressions of what winning the lottery would be like&#8230;</p>

			<p>You know i was thinking just before the big drawing that no witches who are out of the closet have ever won the big one,  then what happens,  That Bunky Character gets a winning ticket.  Why can&#8217;t winning the big one ever be that easy.</p>
