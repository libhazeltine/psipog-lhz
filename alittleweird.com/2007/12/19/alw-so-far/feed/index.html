		<description>Hi Sean, 
Great site. Not sure if people have suggested this before, but have you thought about adding RSS to ALW? Would be brilliant.</description>

		<description>Hey Sean, i was tring TK the other day (with a few small results)and the way i was moveing the psiwheel was that i had one finger on each side of it and it seemed to be following a flow of energy going from one finger to the other.
I was just wondering what your opinion was and if you had ever experienced this?</description>

		<description>Oh sweet! For some reason I was thinking that you made some video introducing yourself or about something weird...silly me ;^_^ That does seem to be the most popular video right now. And just so we get the message across more space to write in there would be nice.</description>

;&#62;_&#62;

And yes, more character space would be nice...I keep running out of room and am forced to make another entire post just to write in 3 or 4 words.</description>

		<description>Yeah that's awesome randomkid are you going to post it? Oh and Sean if you listen to what we think and since you're going to be adding things to the site can you maybe think about giving us more space to write in the video board? Pretty please! not all of us have web cams and stuff.</description>
