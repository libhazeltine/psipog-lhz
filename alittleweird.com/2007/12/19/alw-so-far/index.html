				<p>I was thinking&#8230;</p>
<p>I enjoy this site :-).  In my mind, it&#8217;s a success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad people are using the video board, and it&#8217;s fun to see what videos people post.  I always watch them and read the replies, though I don&#8217;t always reply.  The most requested feature seems to be an Edit button - I&#8217;ll probably add that soon.</p>
<p>The lottery game gets it&#8217;s fair share of use, though it&#8217;s dieing down a little bit.  I was using it as a &#8220;warm up&#8221; before picking numbers, but my current strategy strictly forbids any form of &#8220;warm up&#8221;, so I&#8217;m not using it as much right now.  Either way, I want to create more games for people to play with.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly what the games will be, but I like having the statistics viewable to the public, so everyone can see how each other are doing.  Maybe I&#8217;ll add a card game of some sort&#8230;</p>
<p>I enjoy the blog, but I do want to add some form of permanent content.  Not just a stream of consciousness from me :-P.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly how I want to accomplish this, or what permanent content I want to have, but the feeling is there :-).  I always read the comments and internalize peoples&#8217; questions and suggestions.  Adding a comment to the latest blog entry is a better way to ask questions than sending me an e-mail.  I have a hard time keeping up with my e-mail.</p>
<p>For December, ALW is averaging 390 unique visits/day.  Our peak was August at 455/day, and last month at 419/day.  We&#8217;ve been hovering around these values since June.  My goal is not to attract random people to the site, but I do like to attract intelligent people who have experience in the weird topics we discuss.  Eventually, I hope to attract people to the site who didn&#8217;t come here via PsiPog.net - not because I want to shy away from PsiPog.net, only because I want ALW to stand on it&#8217;s own feet.  <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/alittleweird.com">Alexa</a> ranks ALW at 1,325,716th most popular site on the web :-).  <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/psipog.net">PsiPog.net</a> is currently at 220,160th, by comparison.</p>
<p>I feel ALW now has an identity.  We have a solid chunk of content and unique features that defines what ALW is all about.  My next project will probably be to add another game or two, and then work on some non-blog content.  Maybe spruce up the design a little bit (that large blank area to the right of the logo is really annoying :-P).</p>
<p>A huge thank you goes out to everyone who is reading this right now :-).  I know a lot of people didn&#8217;t like the idea of archiving PsiPog.net, and creating ALW (I still get e-mails to this day about it) - but it was a big step up.  So thank you for reading the blogs, using the video board, and playing around with the lottery game.  And thanks of course for the honest feedback, which I always listen to :-).  I hope to expand ALW for the new year by adding creative and unique features to the site, and developing strong content.  Thanks again!</p>
<p>Also&#8230; if you didn&#8217;t notice, I updated the logo for the holiday season.  If the website has an orange banner at the top, then hit Refresh on your browser :-).</p>

			<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but notice an Adult Swim banner ad on the left side of the screen when I was looking through video channels. Did you choose that, or is it some other advertising source?</p>
<p> Also, what are the chances of a multiplayer game? (Given, the results won&#8217;t really be valid since there is room for cheating.)</p>

			<p>cinderwild - Google decides what ads to run&#8230; I don&#8217;t have any control over it.  I was also thinking about a multiplayer game as well.  I&#8217;ll have to think about what is practical.  I may be able to come up with something.</p>

			<p>I feel like WE should be thanking you Sean. I will admit that at first I was angry that Psipog had been archived mostly because I never got a chance to participate, but this is really a great site you&#8217;ve cooked up. I&#8217;m glad I get the chance to participate this time : )</p>

			<p>agreed. i check in on ALW several times a day (i have no life, okay!) and i really enjoy what you have. though i still think the video board needs to be more just-text friendly. (considering some of us don&#8217;t even have a mic, let alone a web-cam)</p>

			<p>I didn&#8217;t notice the banner until you mentioned it, Sean. Not too observant of me, consider it looks like a green, dead elf staring at you with toxic eyes. </p>
<p>On a similar note, I have noticed that several of the lottery players right here at ALW has some results to show for themselves. No one really struck it big so far, but it&#8217;ll be great if some of you winners can share some behind-the-scenes, backstage show-and-tell to us unfortunate ones. Was it plain fluke? Did you manage to manipulate atmospheric noise? Or is it the &#8216;ol Intention-manifestation at work? Feed our curiosity a little bit, aye?</p>
<p>Speaking of atmospheric noise, I have been wondering about that one. Y&#8217;see, I figured out from a little bit of sniffing around that the random number generator Sean is using utilizes a system based on, according to their website, atmospheric noise. Not being an expert at this, or even any better than plain clueless, I can&#8217;t really figure out any idea for manipulating something like that.</p>
<p>I know that some of us out there uses say.. PK/TK to alter the results of things usually reliant on luck and chance. But how does that work on atmospheric noise? I can&#8217;t use PK/TK for the life of me, so I can&#8217;t test this out myself.</p>
<p>And while we are on topic: Sorry for the belated reply, but here&#8217;s a thank you for your comment on my writings from quite awhile ago, Isabel. And congratulations for being the most profitable in Sean&#8217;s lottery game.</p>

			<p>YAAAAAAAY!!! I FINALLY GOT IN!!!!</p>
<p>hehehe, G-whiz, I remember the times when this page was a tiny, adorable clump of &#8220;underconstruction&#8221; fonts. And to think it took me ALL THIS TIME to reset my password correctly&#8230;(I suck with pc skills -_-)</p>
<p>I as well thank you a lot for this web, and all the cool info from PsiPog. Case in point, it´s actually very few people here in Mexico who you can discuss psionics or pragmatic epistemology without being forced to buy holy angel quartz sets or doing a friggin essay on Kant for no apparent reason (no pun intended&#8230;IT DOES HAPPEN)</p>
<p>I believe that one of the best aspects about all the imput ive seen both here and in Psipog,from Peebrain and all the guys who share their thoughts on this topic, is finally seeing that which we thought mysterious, spooky and supernatural, is actually quite natural and to a simple reach for us to experience, as long as we commit to accept it..</p>
<p>Gosh, Im getting all mushy *snooort*</p>
<p>Hope everything is A-OK with all of you guys. </p>
<p>Merry X-MAS, hannukah, Kwanza&#8230;and&#8230;..um&#8230;&#8230;.enjoy the winter break <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Yeah that&#8217;s awesome randomkid are you going to post it? Oh and Sean if you listen to what we think and since you&#8217;re going to be adding things to the site can you maybe think about giving us more space to write in the video board? Pretty please! not all of us have web cams and stuff.</p>

			<p>Hey Sean, i was tring TK the other day (with a few small results)and the way i was moveing the psiwheel was that i had one finger on each side of it and it seemed to be following a flow of energy going from one finger to the other.<br />
I was just wondering what your opinion was and if you had ever experienced this?</p>
