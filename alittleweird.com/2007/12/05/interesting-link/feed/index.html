		<description>Hmm...well, it certainly looks interesting. I do hope this works out and all, but I'm not getting my hopes up or anything...</description>

		<description>Err... No. I've seen countless reports of "Free Energy" and "Conspiracy" etc. This one is typical. In the video, he sounds almost like Tom Bearden and the rest of those crooks.

It's all bull. The presentation, the "explanations"... I've heard this over and over from people that were in the end proven to be fake. But anyways - I'll watch from the sidelines and decide later, but I'm highly skeptical. Any discovery this great would have long been abused for personal gain.

The site's design and coding is very primitive. No CSS, and it uses proprietary tags, so I can already assume that it's either made by someone with no idea of web-design, or the guy has funding issues and can't hire a professional (and why would that be if he's been someone high up for the FBI???).

Just like Steorn - it will turn out to be impossible. There's been hundreds of attempts like these, and all have failed, so why should this one work?</description>

		<description>Neo, I've got the DVDs that have his lectures, and it is indeed very cool. I think somebody added music to that vid...

Anyways, I'm holding my breath. Stan has gotten calls from DARPA, and what he claims is that the US Gov has known about this technology for a long time, and he wants to get the tech out to the public so that they at least know it exists. Go ahead and watch any of his lectures you can find.

As it says in his bio, Stan worked for the FBI with Above Top Secret Clearance for quite a while. He worked on a "black project" with Dr. Edward Teller in which the goal was to design flying saucers. What he doesn't say in the bio is that the project was worked on in Australia, and after an "incident" (watch the vids) he was not allowed to come back to the US. Some years ago he was granted his citizenship back... blah, I'm getting tired of typing this. Just look up everything about him, and watch whatever vids you can find.</description>

		<description>Off-topic: Codetank looks neat Sean I've never been much of a programmer so it caught my attention. 

On-topic: Sounds like bullshit!</description>

		<description>Uh, I reserve the right to change my mind. I went to the site and watched the video on some of the stuff he presented on google video.

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8222679614108378695&#38;q=stan+deyo&#38;total=9&#38;start=0&#38;num=10&#38;so=0&#38;type=search&#38;plindex=0

I've got to say, that is really interesting. He really might have something going on their. From the sounds of it though, everythings already done, as far as the craft that he was working on. I'm now extremely interested in seeing the outcome of the site and this man's work.</description>

		<description>Wow
"Clue #1: The speed of light will no longer be a barrier or a limit."
If that doesn't say BS I don't know what does. Does this guy actually think he can break the speed of light limit? Yeah, he's attempting to go against a lot of mathematical formulas that are pretty much taken as fact. If he's right then some of Einstein's theory's will be chucked out the window, and many other things we know about quantum physics.</description>
