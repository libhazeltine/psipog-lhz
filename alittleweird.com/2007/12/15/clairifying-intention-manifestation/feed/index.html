		<description>I personally believe intention manifestation is right to a certain extent. I've been able to exploit intention manifestation in order to do TK, which doesn't involve human beings. Basically I don't use energy of any kind, don't become one with the object, nothing like that, just believe in myself and... just move the psi wheel. It may sound weird but it's as easy as it seems. I've been able to use the same method to create a psi ball once and it came out extremely dense and incredibly fast (like, I usually take some minutes in order to mold energy and create one, in this case I made it in the blink of an eye). The problem with intention manifestation though is that simple will isn't enough. Or maybe will just isn't what we think it is. As long as I keep convincing myself on a rational level I usually achieve no results. Sometimes however I get an instinctive boost of confidence and at that point I'm able to do tk. It's like.. as long as the will doesn't reach the subconscious mind it's useless. So yeah, my current theory is: intention manifestation says that by wishing something you can achieve it, it might be right, the problem is actually wishing it. I also agree with the telepathic broadcast theory Sean provided, however I think it can somehow affect non-human beings as well. Also even if good toughts/feelings alone might not be enough, without good toughts/feelings I usually can't achive results. So I belive IM drives us in the right direction, it's just not enough to explain everything about psychic skills.</description>

		<description>I will try to find evidence for your theory. Just to see what happens. :P</description>

He didn't say his results were the ....result of some other type of ability, he just said he didn't like the description of how it works.</description>

		<description>Sean- What about the times you were successful at the lottery? I suppose you were remote viewing then instead of being guided. Is telepathy just easier than remote viewing then? Based on your experiences.</description>

		<description>kiepmad - I'm thinking about that scenario right now (that an explanation is too hard to realistically find, and trying to find one might work against my goals).  I may post on the idea once my mind digests it for a while, and I try a few more things out with the lottery.

Dad - I have had success with telepathy on dogs (Hobbes).  I have had success with energy manipulation on cats (Infinity).  I haven't tested intention manifestation techniques specifically on animals, but from my limited experiences with them, I believe that as long as there is a mind of some sort, there can be communication - though the communication might have to be simplified.  I haven't tested with insects, but I would think that it wouldn't be effective because they don't have a nervous system.  Who knows though.  I can't recall any telepathy experiments done on animals off the top of my head, but I'm sure there must be some out there.</description>

		<description>Interesting.
Your theory would explain group prayer when a group of people are praying for healing, finding employment or easing the pain of loss either by death or divorce. In all these scenarios there is a human element. In my experience these are the top three of four prayer requests. The other is salvation for a loved one, also a human element. This one however is not as successful as the other three.

How successful has intention manifestation been on animals/insects? If itâ€™s not very good with adamant objects like traffic lights and the lottery, but you have had success with humans, then does it stand to reason that dogs, cats and even the fly on your key board are in between so to speak the fishing pole and the fisherman?

Just a thought.</description>

		<description>Then again, can you make something go away by thinking negative thoughts about it, as if you never will have it?</description>

"Using that, the next logical step is: whatever you want in your life, you can attract it, by thinking positive thoughts about it as though you have already attained it. Visualize. Feel. Get into it."

Good point. I agree with you, except the idea of telepathic broadcasting. The question is, do we need an explanation. Naturally we want an explanation, human progress is based on finding explanation. But there might be realms where an explanation cannot be found...</description>

		<description>Hey Sean,
I think you might be on to something.. In a lot of intention manifestation books, they always tend to say something along the lines of "don't bother trying to win the lottery" and then give a lot of silly explanations as to why you shouldn't.

I have a request though. Could you explain the method you used to achieve the things you have through intention manifestation? 
thanks
