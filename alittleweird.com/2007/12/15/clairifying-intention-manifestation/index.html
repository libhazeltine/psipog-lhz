			<div class="entry">
				<p>I was reading my past couple posts, and noticed that I&#8217;m ragging on intention manifestation quite a bit.  I want to clarify exactly what I think intention manifestation is, and exactly what parts I take issue with.</p>
<p>First, for those that don&#8217;t know: the idea of intention manifestation is basically that if you think good thoughts, and follow your emotions, then you will attract good things.  It became popular for a short time with the movie <a href="http://www.thesecret.tv/">The Secret</a>, especially once it got the Oprah bump.  It&#8217;s a very empowering mindset, that states we attract whatever we think and feel about.  If we think/feel bad things, then we attract bad things.  If we think/feel good things - then we attract good things.</p>
<p>Using that, the next logical step is: whatever you want in your life, you can attract it, by thinking positive thoughts about it as though you have already attained it.  Visualize.  Feel.  Get into it.  And you&#8217;ll send out the attraction-vibes out to the universe, and then the universe will respond.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Here is where I take issue: there is a distinct difference between attaining results, and explaining results.  If you can attain something, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you can explain how or why you were successful.</p>
<p>For example, I am really good at math.  When I was in high school, I could learn math very easily, and I advanced quickly through the grades.  Can I tell you WHY I&#8217;m good at math?  I have some ideas - but really, I don&#8217;t know.  I was born this way, I suppose.  I really don&#8217;t know exactly why I&#8217;m good at math.</p>
<p>What if I was convinced that I&#8217;m good at math because I eat a lot of chicken?  People might ask me for help in math, and I would instruct them: eat chicken!  That&#8217;s what I do, and look at how good I am!  I might conclude that there is a chemical in chicken that helps stimulate the part of the brain responsible for logic and math.</p>
<p>Now the idea is silly - but the point is very valid.  Just because I&#8217;m successful at something doesn&#8217;t mean I can give a reason WHY I&#8217;m successful.  Back to intention manifestation&#8230;</p>
<p>I believe that a lot of smart people started to notice that weird things happen in reality.  &#8220;Coincidence&#8221; simply couldn&#8217;t explain the weird events in their lives.  So they invented an explanation: intention manifestation.  It&#8217;s a wonderful theory that can explain weird events without relying on the idea of &#8220;coincidence&#8221;.</p>
<p>I believe the theory is incorrect.  When I say that, I&#8217;m NOT saying that people don&#8217;t experience weird things.  I don&#8217;t believe the theory of &#8220;coincidence&#8221; is correct either.  I DO believe we can manipulate reality in some metaphysical way, to produce results.  I&#8217;ve seen that with my own eyes.  But there is a difference between attaining the results, and explaining the results.  I have attained the same results others have - I simply don&#8217;t like the explanation of intention manifestation.</p>
<p>I am not skeptical of the results - I&#8217;m skeptical of the explanation.  I&#8217;m not saying, &#8220;Prove to me that intention manifestation can produce results!&#8221;  Not at all.  What I am saying is: &#8220;Prove to me that intention manifestation is the correct explanation for these results.&#8221;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I offer an alternate theory for explaining the weird results we see using intention manifestation techniques.  My theory is that intention manifestation techniques are actually sending out a telepathic broadcast, that others pick up on subconsciously.  These telepathic transmissions influence our decision making process.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve been paying attention, your response might be: &#8220;Prove to me that telepathy is the correct explanation for these weird results.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t offer that much proof, except personal experience as evidence.</p>
<p>I have been successful with intention manifestation when using it on things that humans affect.  For example, I have been successful using intention manifestation on attracting females, helping out friends and family members, getting more play time in soccer, meeting new people, etc.  Each successful application of intention manifestation has had a human mind in the equation that could be influenced telepathically to help me achieve my goal.</p>
<p>I have had extremely limited success with intention manifestation when using it on things that humans have very little affect on.  For example, I have been mostly unsuccessful using intention manifestation to make red lights turn green, win scratch off lottery tickets, and win drawing-based lotteries.</p>
<p>This leads me to conclude that the normal explanation for intention manifestation must be incorrect.  If it was as simple as letting the universe fulfill my desires, then I should have had equal success across the board.  Instead, the human-related attempts were overly successful, and the hard-reality-related attempts were mostly failures.  This leads me to believe that a human being is important in the equation, and that telepathy of some sort could then be involved.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In conclusion, when I attack the idea of intention manifestation, please understand that I am attacking the theory.  Not the results.  I completely agree that weird things happen, and that doing intention manifestation techniques can produce results.  What I am attacking is the reason WHY the techniques produce results.  I do not believe the universe is listening to us, granting us our wishes based on what we think and feel.  My results are not congruent with that theory.  Instead, I believe a better explanation is some form of group telepathy, where one person&#8217;s strong desires can influence a group of people subconsciously.</p>

			<p>Hey Sean,<br />
I think you might be on to something.. In a lot of intention manifestation books, they always tend to say something along the lines of &#8220;don&#8217;t bother trying to win the lottery&#8221; and then give a lot of silly explanations as to why you shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I have a request though. Could you explain the method you used to achieve the things you have through intention manifestation?<br />
thanks</p>

<p>Good point. I agree with you, except the idea of telepathic broadcasting. The question is, do we need an explanation. Naturally we want an explanation, human progress is based on finding explanation. But there might be realms where an explanation cannot be found&#8230;</p>

			<p>Interesting.<br />
Your theory would explain group prayer when a group of people are praying for healing, finding employment or easing the pain of loss either by death or divorce. In all these scenarios there is a human element. In my experience these are the top three of four prayer requests. The other is salvation for a loved one, also a human element. This one however is not as successful as the other three.</p>
<p>How successful has intention manifestation been on animals/insects? If it’s not very good with adamant objects like traffic lights and the lottery, but you have had success with humans, then does it stand to reason that dogs, cats and even the fly on your key board are in between so to speak the fishing pole and the fisherman?</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

			<p>kiepmad - I&#8217;m thinking about that scenario right now (that an explanation is too hard to realistically find, and trying to find one might work against my goals).  I may post on the idea once my mind digests it for a while, and I try a few more things out with the lottery.</p>
<p>Dad - I have had success with telepathy on dogs (Hobbes).  I have had success with energy manipulation on cats (Infinity).  I haven&#8217;t tested intention manifestation techniques specifically on animals, but from my limited experiences with them, I believe that as long as there is a mind of some sort, there can be communication - though the communication might have to be simplified.  I haven&#8217;t tested with insects, but I would think that it wouldn&#8217;t be effective because they don&#8217;t have a nervous system.  Who knows though.  I can&#8217;t recall any telepathy experiments done on animals off the top of my head, but I&#8217;m sure there must be some out there.</p>

			<p>Sean- What about the times you were successful at the lottery? I suppose you were remote viewing then instead of being guided. Is telepathy just easier than remote viewing then? Based on your experiences.</p>

			<p>I personally believe intention manifestation is right to a certain extent. I&#8217;ve been able to exploit intention manifestation in order to do TK, which doesn&#8217;t involve human beings. Basically I don&#8217;t use energy of any kind, don&#8217;t become one with the object, nothing like that, just believe in myself and&#8230; just move the psi wheel. It may sound weird but it&#8217;s as easy as it seems. I&#8217;ve been able to use the same method to create a psi ball once and it came out extremely dense and incredibly fast (like, I usually take some minutes in order to mold energy and create one, in this case I made it in the blink of an eye). The problem with intention manifestation though is that simple will isn&#8217;t enough. Or maybe will just isn&#8217;t what we think it is. As long as I keep convincing myself on a rational level I usually achieve no results. Sometimes however I get an instinctive boost of confidence and at that point I&#8217;m able to do tk. It&#8217;s like.. as long as the will doesn&#8217;t reach the subconscious mind it&#8217;s useless. So yeah, my current theory is: intention manifestation says that by wishing something you can achieve it, it might be right, the problem is actually wishing it. I also agree with the telepathic broadcast theory Sean provided, however I think it can somehow affect non-human beings as well. Also even if good toughts/feelings alone might not be enough, without good toughts/feelings I usually can&#8217;t achive results. So I belive IM drives us in the right direction, it&#8217;s just not enough to explain everything about psychic skills.</p>
