		<description>hmm the only thing i can predict is where are the mines in minesweeper with out calculating there exact points but i need to practice more =S, well anyways i agree with Dash its possible that the future has changed but not just because of Joe, I'm sure there are a lot of pyschic's altering the future so who knows how badly it will change. oh and i have this book SIGHNED by Joe Mcmonagle haven't read it yet i have a couple of others i need to read first but i'll just put a pass on it for now. Oh and Sean you should right a review on Journeys out of the body, I read it too and i loved it =D we should get more people to read it =DD</description>

		<description>5. In 2008, the standard RAM in a computer will be 128 MB.

Ok, time to downgrade...

Apparently he's just not good at predictions of the future. Shame. On the other hand, I'm not too great at it either, but I can predict a few things with decent accuracy. Usually no more than a couple days before it happens, but I don't pretend to be better than I am.</description>

		<description>books.. bleh... i try to stay away from them.. bad for your health :P

but the future is an ever changing thing, i admit.. his predictions are pretty out there.. but still .. it could have been an alternate future.
the only way to see the future is to see it and forget what you saw, continue as if nothing happened.. he made a book.. thats all it takes to take an alternate path right?
i dont know.. just thinking about all of the angles</description>

		<description>Wow. That is bad. Well at least his predictions aren't vague.

I've been told that Opening to the Infinite by Stephan A. Schwarz, who is also a remote viewer, is a good read. Maybe that would have been a better choice.</description>

		<description>while similar, i'm sure there's some level of difference between RVing a current target and RVing through time. just because he's failed at one doesn't mean he wasn't good at the other.</description>
