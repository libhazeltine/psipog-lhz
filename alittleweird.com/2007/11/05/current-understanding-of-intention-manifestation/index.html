			<div class="entry">
				<p>My understanding of intention manifestation (IM) has evolved quite a lot over the years.  Ironically, my current understanding of IM has come full circle, and is now the same understanding I had when I first began experimenting with it, at age 16.</p>
<p>When I was 16, we didn&#8217;t call it &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; - we called it transmitting.  The idea was to broadcast a telepathic intent to the universal unconscious.  I&#8217;m not sure where the term &#8220;transmission&#8221; came from - perhaps Rainsong or Myriad came up with it.  Or maybe they just taught me the term, and it was coined by someone else.  Either way, that was my original understanding of the skill: as a telepathic broadcast.  But since the term &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; has become somewhat mainstream, I&#8217;ll continue to use that, since I do believe it is the same skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal unconscious&#8221; comes from Carl Jung (also known as the &#8220;collective unconscious&#8221;, or &#8220;objective psyche&#8221;).  The idea - as I understand it - is that we all share a common unconscious mind.  From this common mind, our conscious minds are just a small part sticking out.  Think of it like a big ocean - the waves are our conscious minds, which perceive from our location to be independent and separate.  But in reality, we are connected by a huge mass of common unconsciousness beneath us.</p>
<p>With this model, we can see how telepathy could be explained (in general).  Since we are all connected on an unconscious level, all we need to do is build a link between two extensions of consciousness (aka &#8220;people&#8221;), and communication will be the same as thinking to ourselves.</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven&#8217;t confused you too much.  It&#8217;s harder to explain than it is to understand :-P.  Here&#8217;s a picture!</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.png" title="Zen Ocean"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.thumbnail.png" alt="Zen Ocean" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(Click)</p>
<p></a></p>
<p>Either way, a transmission (or intention), is basically broadcasting out a thought on the entire universal unconscious.  Impressing the common mind with a thought.  Burning an image into the collective brain.  Once this broadcast has happened, then all conscious beings will receive it via intuition and gut feelings, of something they should act on.  That&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>Now why is this important?  Well&#8230; in the mainstream version of intention manifestation, you basically get whatever you want.  You just visualize it, and POOF!  It appears randomly some day!  This is incorrect, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If intention manifestation is limited by the ideas presented above, then really the only way intention manifestation can affect reality is by altering everyone&#8217;s collective intuition.  To do such a thing would be extremely useful for certain goals!  For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a lover, then by broadcasting your intent, all humans will unconsciously see that you are looking for a lover, and it will attract some people to you also looking for love.  If you&#8217;re looking for a business, or advice, or a parking spot, or anything where telepathy can serve you - then intention manifestation will be useful.  (Intending a parking spot could be telepathically telling people to hurry up and get in their car so they&#8217;ll leave in time for you to take their spot.)</p>
<p>However: if intention manifestation is a telepathic broadcast, then there are certain things it wouldn&#8217;t be useful for.  Mainly things that can&#8217;t be affected by an intuitive human.  Like the lottery.</p>
<p>With the lottery, I could be the best telepath in the world, but that won&#8217;t affect the lottery balls.  They aren&#8217;t conscious (right?!).  The procedure for drawing lottery balls is designed to remove the human element from the equation.  Which means I can visualize all I want, and I can scream my intention out to the unconscious all I want - but no one can do anything about it.  No one can help me.  No one can come to my rescue.</p>
<p>So - it is my belief that you can not win the lottery using intention manifestation.  And my results confirm this.</p>
<p>However, all is obviously not lost :-).  There must be some metaphysical way to win the lottery, because I still can&#8217;t explain how people win the lottery twice, and I can&#8217;t explain my own results with the lottery.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I should have taken the advice of a friend when I first dreamed up this goal.  He told me that I either have to predict the lottery numbers (via ESP), or manipulate the lottery numbers (via micro-PK).  Or maybe a combination of both.  Either way - I have to pick at least one or the other.  I theorized I had some more options - mainly intention manifestation and altering my beliefs about reality.  However, as we see, these are dead ends for the lottery.</p>
<p>So, I have a choice.  Either I can try to predict the lottery numbers, or I can affect the lottery numbers to a pre-determined set.  I have a long history of predicting the future, reading people, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that haven&#8217;t happened, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that I don&#8217;t know, and basically be bored with reality&#8217;s linear nature.  I also have a history of frustrating and unimpressive PK results.  Well gee whiz.  What should I do? <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Prediction it is!</p>
<p>It should be noted that I don&#8217;t know how I won the MegaMillions back in March.  I don&#8217;t remember if it was by prediction, or some other means.  I do know it happened right after I had the breakthrough in realizing that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; but that&#8217;s all I associate with those wins.  So I don&#8217;t know if ESP has helped me in the past with MegaMillions.</p>
<p>However, my luck with the scratch off tickets may very well have been from ESP.  When I first decided to go on my road trip to buy winning lottery tickets, I actually got a flash of the map I would end up driving before starting the trip.  I didn&#8217;t record it at the time because I was trying to focus on intention manifestation - not ESP :-P.  I didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by using ESP :-P.</p>
<p>And finally, before I end this post, I should also note that I tried to win the lottery using Remote Viewing in the past, and failed.  I did this when I was around 20 years old, and the reason I believe I failed was because of lack of skill, incorrect technique, and bad experiment design.  But hey, it was my first one, so I can&#8217;t be too hard on myself :-P.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s game time though :-P.  I&#8217;m 200x more sensitive and accurate now compared to where I was 4 years ago.  If I didn&#8217;t already know I would be correct, I would amaze myself :-P.</p>
<p>Also: if you saw my last post, then you saw my sweet ass lottery machine.  It&#8217;s in development, and not completed yet.  I shall be posting more videos as I build it.  It&#8217;s gonna kick ass :-).  Oh goodie&#8230;</p>

			<p>First comment! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I beleive intention manifestation doesnt work with telepathy. You have the intent for it so I think micro PK happens to get it. Just because you couldnt do it doesnt mean its impossible. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>That&#8217;s a theoretical fair idea.  What I&#8217;ve experienced doesn&#8217;t match it, though.  Surely I&#8217;m not the only one whose experienced IM - but I have nothing else to base my opinion on, so I&#8217;ll continue to believe it&#8217;s telepathic in nature.  Unless you have real world evidence that I should consider?</p>

			<p>So&#8230; to sum it up, you mean that IM only works for things involving humans, and that the rest (i.e. perception/manipulation) only works for objects?</p>

			<p>I think I may have experienced IM a few times, mainly when I have played a video game and couldn&#8217;t win. I would then tell myself I would win, and I visualized myself winning, and I won. But, I think I might have been doing Micro-PK instead. </p>
<p>And Sean, I think you should also post more information on psychic skills like PK, telepathy, psiballs, all that stuff, like you did on Psipog. I like all this stuff, but I think there needs to be more info on psychic stuff. Or, there might already be some, and I haven&#8217;t really noticed.</p>

			<p>I think Sean kinda had it with getting the &#8220;skills&#8221;.<br />
It would seem he is thinking about the big picture. The reality and the actual laws of it.</p>
<p>This fee thinking environment is exactly what was suppressed by a battalion of moderators back in psipog days. </p>
<p>Here the speech is free, and the ideas more varied.</p>
<p>As far as I have observed, the psipog was not exactly making much progress in R&amp;D department anyway. Sure, they shared a fair bit of knowledge and from time to time, somebody came across a technique or two, but the basic fundamentals have remained the same.</p>
<p>And apparently, nobody has made any world shattering progress during these last years. Even the legendary NI got tired of things and left the scene.</p>
<p>I think the problem is here: Nobody is dedicated enough to actually gain any significant progress. People get bored, tired and distracted in no time. The instant gratification of TV, games, alcohol, friends, life =P. It all gains a priority over psionics.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, then I must ask whats the holdup?</p>
<p>Possible cases:</p>
<p>A) People are as flimsy as I fear.<br />
B) We are doing something fundamentally wrong.<br />
C) We have already hit the cap that only a talented few can reach.</p>
<p>Sollution?</p>
<p>Case A: Like teaching a gorilla to drive. It could, but it wont.</p>
<p>Case B: We must expand our paradigm and allow any ideas to be presented openly. </p>
<p>Case C: Nobody likes this possibility, but it could really be the truth. (Not that I believe or want to believe it)</p>

			<p>AntiSankari, somehow I have the feeling that you&#8217;re right XD. Well, you are right, even though no one wants to admit it. People in this world are just simply too focussed on the material, and on personal gain. It&#8217;s not about how much they can help others or humankind - it&#8217;s about the fame they can attain, and the money.</p>
<p>It comes down to this: money, sex, and power. The three biggest corupters of humankind. No surprise PSI research hasn&#8217;t been given much attention - it&#8217;s too hard to gain recognition, or to actually find out something.</p>

			<p>Why would Sean blog about PK and psiballs if he no longer gives a damn about it? It is natural and correct that one should blog about what he experiences and is passionate about, not about what is popular and more people want to read about.</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well first of all, I&#8217;ll have to disagree with Antisankari, concerning a few aspects of his/her statements. Specifically the &#8220;fee&#8221; thinking environment statement. The way we perceived it back then, and how I still perceive learning environments is that you either know your information and can produce results, or you can&#8217;t. The only problem with a &#8220;Free&#8221; thinking environment is that it quickly becomes a &#8220;what if&#8221; environment, instead of manufacturing results. Continuously gossiping on what ifs and maybes quickly get old, and quite pointless. The reason behind our “fee” thinking environment is because the people who were telling people how stuff is done, were the people who could substantially produce results advocating the significance of the information given. I didn’t, and still to this day think it was a bad concept at all. If you had an idea, test it and produce results. If you didn’t, learn from people who can. Quite a simple, and profoundly working concept which advocated success for the people who were dedicated. </p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the oldie in me, that that&#8217;s how I perceive learning environment. Though I do agree with you on the fact that aspects of life do become a larger priority in succeeding in areas on psionics. People are less dedicated than the older days, though we had a lot of quitters back then as well. </p>
<p>Just wanted to give my two cents. I enjoyed the blog, Sean. Catch me in the chat room, or on AIM. I&#8217;ve had a lot of success with predicting numbers using a certain aspect of remote viewing that I&#8217;ll be happy to elaborate on. Maybe pull you in some $$ <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>- JoeT</p>
