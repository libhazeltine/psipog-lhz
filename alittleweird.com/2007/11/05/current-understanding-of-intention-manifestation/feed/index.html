		<description>Hello,

Well first of all, I'll have to disagree with Antisankari, concerning a few aspects of his/her statements. Specifically the "fee" thinking environment statement. The way we perceived it back then, and how I still perceive learning environments is that you either know your information and can produce results, or you can't. The only problem with a "Free" thinking environment is that it quickly becomes a "what if" environment, instead of manufacturing results. Continuously gossiping on what ifs and maybes quickly get old, and quite pointless. The reason behind our “fee” thinking environment is because the people who were telling people how stuff is done, were the people who could substantially produce results advocating the significance of the information given. I didn’t, and still to this day think it was a bad concept at all. If you had an idea, test it and produce results. If you didn’t, learn from people who can. Quite a simple, and profoundly working concept which advocated success for the people who were dedicated. 

Perhaps it's the oldie in me, that that's how I perceive learning environment. Though I do agree with you on the fact that aspects of life do become a larger priority in succeeding in areas on psionics. People are less dedicated than the older days, though we had a lot of quitters back then as well. 

Just wanted to give my two cents. I enjoyed the blog, Sean. Catch me in the chat room, or on AIM. I've had a lot of success with predicting numbers using a certain aspect of remote viewing that I'll be happy to elaborate on. Maybe pull you in some $$ ;-)

Take care,

		<description>Why would Sean blog about PK and psiballs if he no longer gives a damn about it? It is natural and correct that one should blog about what he experiences and is passionate about, not about what is popular and more people want to read about.</description>

		<description>AntiSankari, somehow I have the feeling that you're right XD. Well, you are right, even though no one wants to admit it. People in this world are just simply too focussed on the material, and on personal gain. It's not about how much they can help others or humankind - it's about the fame they can attain, and the money.

It comes down to this: money, sex, and power. The three biggest corupters of humankind. No surprise PSI research hasn't been given much attention - it's too hard to gain recognition, or to actually find out something.</description>

		<description>I think Sean kinda had it with getting the "skills". 
It would seem he is thinking about the big picture. The reality and the actual laws of it.

This fee thinking environment is exactly what was suppressed by a battalion of moderators back in psipog days. 

Here the speech is free, and the ideas more varied.

As far as I have observed, the psipog was not exactly making much progress in R&#38;D department anyway. Sure, they shared a fair bit of knowledge and from time to time, somebody came across a technique or two, but the basic fundamentals have remained the same.

And apparently, nobody has made any world shattering progress during these last years. Even the legendary NI got tired of things and left the scene.

I think the problem is here: Nobody is dedicated enough to actually gain any significant progress. People get bored, tired and distracted in no time. The instant gratification of TV, games, alcohol, friends, life =P. It all gains a priority over psionics.

If this is not the case, then I must ask whats the holdup?

Possible cases:

A) People are as flimsy as I fear.
B) We are doing something fundamentally wrong.
C) We have already hit the cap that only a talented few can reach.


Sollution?

Case A: Like teaching a gorilla to drive. It could, but it wont.

Case B: We must expand our paradigm and allow any ideas to be presented openly. 

Case C: Nobody likes this possibility, but it could really be the truth. (Not that I believe or want to believe it)</description>

		<description>I think I may have experienced IM a few times, mainly when I have played a video game and couldn't win. I would then tell myself I would win, and I visualized myself winning, and I won. But, I think I might have been doing Micro-PK instead. 

And Sean, I think you should also post more information on psychic skills like PK, telepathy, psiballs, all that stuff, like you did on Psipog. I like all this stuff, but I think there needs to be more info on psychic stuff. Or, there might already be some, and I haven't really noticed.</description>

		<description>So... to sum it up, you mean that IM only works for things involving humans, and that the rest (i.e. perception/manipulation) only works for objects?</description>

		<description>That's a theoretical fair idea.  What I've experienced doesn't match it, though.  Surely I'm not the only one whose experienced IM - but I have nothing else to base my opinion on, so I'll continue to believe it's telepathic in nature.  Unless you have real world evidence that I should consider?</description>

		<description>First comment! :-) I beleive intention manifestation doesnt work with telepathy. You have the intent for it so I think micro PK happens to get it. Just because you couldnt do it doesnt mean its impossible. :-D</description>
