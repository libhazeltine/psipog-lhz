					<p>There is a disease in the psionic &#8220;movement&#8221;.   I&#8217;m sure this disease exists in nearly all groups of people, but it is particularly potent in the OEC.  The disease is: apathetic inactivity.</p>
<p>You can group psions into two groups: those who do things, and those who don&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m not being specific, because it really doesn&#8217;t have to get specific.  The question we need to ask ourselves, as individuals, is: Do I do anything to add to the collective knowledge of psionics?  Do I <em>do</em> anything?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about psionics here.  Not websites.  Not chat rooms.  Not forums.  Not blogs.  Psionics.  Psychic abilities.</p>
<p>Top 10 ways to <em>do</em> something:</p>
<p>1. Have a training regiment for a psionic ability.  And actually DO it.</p>
<p>2. Come up with ideas on how psionics might work.  And actually TEST your ideas with experiments.</p>
<p>3. Read a book about psychic abilities.  And actually READ it.</p>
<p>4. Read scientific documents about <em>real research</em> being done with psychic abilities.  And actually put effort towards UNDERSTANDING the material.</p>
<p>5. Practice.  But do so in a way that you can actually MEASURE your progress, so you can figure out if something is actually working or not.</p>
<p>6. Share your experiences with others.  And be HONEST, and reasonably critical of yourself.  Encourage others to be critical of your experiences.</p>
<p>7. Create VERIFIABLE scenarios.  Avoid situations where there can always be &#8220;a way out&#8221;.</p>
<p>8. Buy or participate in a professional psychic training program.  Then REPORT your results after following the instructions completely.</p>
<p>9. Go to a large public LIBRARY, perhaps taking a trip to a University, and look up the past experiments by parapsychologists.</p>
<p>10. TRY NEW THINGS.  Be pro-active.</p>
<p>I hate seeing so many smart people sit around and do nothing.  I hate seeing inactivity when there is so much that could be accomplished.  It&#8217;s not like psionics is closed book - it&#8217;s about the most open thing you can find.  Were not talking about Newtonian Physics, where everything has basically been figured out.  Were talking about a field where <em>any</em> individual can come by and revolutionize the entire paradigm!</p>
<p>I also hate seeing people fake doing things, or coming up with lame excuses, or being passive aggressive.  Do not create a website unless you actually have something of value to share.  Do not lie about your ability - <strong>period</strong>.  Do not talk about practicing - actually PRACTICE.  Do not write a 10-page post on your theory of psionics.  In fact - don&#8217;t write one page, unless you plan on actually TESTING it some way in the near future.  Theories are a dime a dozen.  Results, evidence, documentation of experiments - including failed ones - are the nuggets of gold.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t miss PsiPog.  I do miss the core of people who actually did things - they are more rare than I gave them credit.  But PsiPog as a whole suffered from the same disease as every other OEC&#8230; stagnation.  Either you&#8217;re moving forward, or you&#8217;re standing still.  <em>Do</em> something for psionics.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ah, November 11th.</p>
<p>Yes, it is Veterans Day.  But the numbers 11:11 have a paranormal meaning as well.</p>
<p>I was introduced to the ideas around 11:11 by a famous website, <a href="http://crystalinks.com/">CrystaLinks</a>.  You can find the 11:11 page <a href="http://crystalinks.com/11.11.html">here</a>.  The reason I first read it was simply because it&#8217;s the top article in the alphabetized index :-P.  Seemed like a good place to start learning about psychic abilities!</p>
<p>After I read the page, I started noticing 11:11 all around me.  I suppose it&#8217;s just a mental trick, where you subconsciously start to look for it, so you notice it all the time.  <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0481369/">The Number 23</a> might do the same thing :-P.  Luckily, I didn&#8217;t go insane, and start writing 11:11 all over everything in charcoal&#8230; yet. <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I could never really trust the stories around 11:11&#8230; I mean&#8230; DNA activation?  What does that even mean?  Numerology never really interested me, because I&#8217;m very good at math, and I knew that you could find all sorts of patterns in seemingly random places - just by looking around.  I didn&#8217;t really understand why one would trust one pattern over another&#8230; it&#8217;s just numbers.  They make patterns.  That&#8217;s what they do.  So I just threw all those ideas out the window.</p>
<p>But the subconscious seed had already been planted, and I kept seeing 11:11 everywhere, despite my rejection.  The more I tried not to see it, the more I saw it!  So I came to the conclusion that I might as well put it to good use&#8230; to this day, any time I see 11:11, I just tell myself, &#8220;You are psychic&#8221;.  So, for me, 11:11 represents a constant reminder that the world is a mystical place.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve re-read the CrystaLinks page today, it all seems insanely silly.  But oh well :-).  It&#8217;s still a cool idea, and I can&#8217;t wait until 2012 to see if all these crazy prophecies come true.  You never know.  It&#8217;ll be quite the event, no matter what happens :-).</p>
<p>Happy 11/11!</p>

					<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In March of 2007, the MegaMillions jackpot rose to a record-level $390 million.  At the time, I was on vacation visiting my father in Georgia.  He asked me a question that most people were probably asking themselves at the time: What would I do with $390 million?</p>
<p>This question sparked a chain of thoughts in my mind.  Being a self-proclaimed psychic, winning the lottery was always a topic of discussion&#8230; but for some reason, when my father asked me that question, the jackpot felt real and within reach.  Not just an idle idea in the back of my head - it was now tangible.  I&#8217;m not sure why I had this reaction; I suppose it was just the right thought at the right time.</p>
<p>I started playing MegaMillions after I returned home from my vacation, and my thoughts started to seriously tackle the problem of: How could I win?</p>
<h3>Modern Understanding</h3>
<p>Before we get into the meat of things, let&#8217;s at least outline what the modern understanding of the lottery is.  The basic idea of the game is that a lot of people put up a little bit of money, and one or more people are chosen at random to take home the large sum.  The game profits by controlling how much the winners receive - usually leaving a large chunk for public education and taxes.  Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.</p>
<p>This &#8220;random choice&#8221; is different for each game, but usually it consists of a container with lottery balls inside of it, that are shuffled around, and automatically chosen by a machine.  This eliminates any human interaction and potential for cheating.  The machines are inspected before the drawing, and measurements are performed to ensure they don&#8217;t favor any particular number over the rest.  We have to be fair!</p>
<p>Our modern understanding is that there is no systematic way to win the lottery.  But shhh&#8230; don&#8217;t tell that to the thousands of products out there that proclaim there is :-P.  I&#8217;ve never bought a &#8220;lottery cheating system&#8221;, because I&#8217;m far to cynical when it comes to salesmen who intentionally misunderstand basic probability and statistics in order to take advantage of their customers :-P.  I love probability.  I love statistics.  I love correct math :-).</p>
<p>Statistics and probability are very useful and the calculations are beautiful and correct.  But if that&#8217;s so&#8230; how could I ever hope to win the lottery?  The very math disciplines that I claim to understand and appreciate are the same ones that say the lottery is a random system, and it&#8217;s impossible to win at a higher rate than anyone else.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; I found a way.  Theoretically.</p>
<h3>Randomness Doesn&#8217;t Exist</h3>
<p>Statistics and probability are just mathematical systems - they have no authority over how reality behaves, and can accept no critiquing from reality.  Numbers are numbers.  It&#8217;s humans, who interpret the numbers, that put the meaning behind the math.  That&#8217;s where I find fault.</p>
<p>Our human interpretation of the numbers is that reality is capable of being random.  Given a random reality, we can calculate the odds of a certain outcome&#8230; and since our reality is random (according to our human interpretation), there is no way to predict or control the outcome.  It&#8217;s important to distinguish between the math formulas - which say nothing about reality - and the human interpretation - which states that we are measuring a random reality.</p>
<p>However, if this idea of randomness doesn&#8217;t actually EXIST in reality, then our interpretation of statistics and probability is completely wrong.  The math is still correct - the numbers just mean something else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a lot of thinking and writing on the subject of randomness in my blog.  You can read the major posts here:  <a href="../05/19/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-1/index.html">Randomness Doesn&#8217;t Exist, Part 1</a>, <a href="../05/21/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-2/index.html">Part 2</a>, <a href="../05/23/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-3/index.html">Part 3</a>.  There are a lot of good counter-points in the comments as well, so be sure to read how others have responded, and how I responded to them.  I continue to debate the idea in my head, but I feel my logic is solid, and the evidence in reality supports my conclusions.</p>
<h3>Early Results</h3>
<p>My early results (from March 2007 - June 2007) were very positive.  I won smaller prizes on the MegaMillions (with odds around 1 in 43,000), and I was boasting a healthy profit $55+ with my scratch off tickets.  In fact, on one day I won $70 on two tickets, back to back.  I video taped the entire experience, from start to finish, here: <a href="../05/27/i-won-again/index.html">I Won Again with Video</a>.  My success motivated my father to give it a shot as well, which he documented here: <a href="../06/04/it-begins/index.html">Video</a>.</p>
<p>My early results were awesome, and they helped solidify my beliefs about randomness.  I&#8217;ve shattered the odds, and modern statistics and probability cannot explain my results.  Plus I won some cash that helped pay my bills :-).  Hurray reality!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my results did dip during the summer.  Please continue reading by clicking here: <a href="07/lottery-project-part-2/index.html">Lottery Project, Part 2</a>.</p>

<p class="postheader"><small class="postauth">November 5th, 2007 by <a href="../../index.html@author=2.html">Sean</a></small><span class="posttitle"><a href="05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Current Understanding of I.M.">Current Understanding of I.M.</a></span></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My understanding of intention manifestation (IM) has evolved quite a lot over the years.  Ironically, my current understanding of IM has come full circle, and is now the same understanding I had when I first began experimenting with it, at age 16.</p>
<p>When I was 16, we didn&#8217;t call it &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; - we called it transmitting.  The idea was to broadcast a telepathic intent to the universal unconscious.  I&#8217;m not sure where the term &#8220;transmission&#8221; came from - perhaps Rainsong or Myriad came up with it.  Or maybe they just taught me the term, and it was coined by someone else.  Either way, that was my original understanding of the skill: as a telepathic broadcast.  But since the term &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; has become somewhat mainstream, I&#8217;ll continue to use that, since I do believe it is the same skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal unconscious&#8221; comes from Carl Jung (also known as the &#8220;collective unconscious&#8221;, or &#8220;objective psyche&#8221;).  The idea - as I understand it - is that we all share a common unconscious mind.  From this common mind, our conscious minds are just a small part sticking out.  Think of it like a big ocean - the waves are our conscious minds, which perceive from our location to be independent and separate.  But in reality, we are connected by a huge mass of common unconsciousness beneath us.</p>
<p>With this model, we can see how telepathy could be explained (in general).  Since we are all connected on an unconscious level, all we need to do is build a link between two extensions of consciousness (aka &#8220;people&#8221;), and communication will be the same as thinking to ourselves.</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven&#8217;t confused you too much.  It&#8217;s harder to explain than it is to understand :-P.  Here&#8217;s a picture!</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.png" title="Zen Ocean"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.thumbnail.png" alt="Zen Ocean" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(Click)</p>
<p></a></p>
<p>Either way, a transmission (or intention), is basically broadcasting out a thought on the entire universal unconscious.  Impressing the common mind with a thought.  Burning an image into the collective brain.  Once this broadcast has happened, then all conscious beings will receive it via intuition and gut feelings, of something they should act on.  That&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>Now why is this important?  Well&#8230; in the mainstream version of intention manifestation, you basically get whatever you want.  You just visualize it, and POOF!  It appears randomly some day!  This is incorrect, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If intention manifestation is limited by the ideas presented above, then really the only way intention manifestation can affect reality is by altering everyone&#8217;s collective intuition.  To do such a thing would be extremely useful for certain goals!  For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a lover, then by broadcasting your intent, all humans will unconsciously see that you are looking for a lover, and it will attract some people to you also looking for love.  If you&#8217;re looking for a business, or advice, or a parking spot, or anything where telepathy can serve you - then intention manifestation will be useful.  (Intending a parking spot could be telepathically telling people to hurry up and get in their car so they&#8217;ll leave in time for you to take their spot.)</p>
<p>However: if intention manifestation is a telepathic broadcast, then there are certain things it wouldn&#8217;t be useful for.  Mainly things that can&#8217;t be affected by an intuitive human.  Like the lottery.</p>
<p>With the lottery, I could be the best telepath in the world, but that won&#8217;t affect the lottery balls.  They aren&#8217;t conscious (right?!).  The procedure for drawing lottery balls is designed to remove the human element from the equation.  Which means I can visualize all I want, and I can scream my intention out to the unconscious all I want - but no one can do anything about it.  No one can help me.  No one can come to my rescue.</p>
<p>So - it is my belief that you can not win the lottery using intention manifestation.  And my results confirm this.</p>
<p>However, all is obviously not lost :-).  There must be some metaphysical way to win the lottery, because I still can&#8217;t explain how people win the lottery twice, and I can&#8217;t explain my own results with the lottery.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I should have taken the advice of a friend when I first dreamed up this goal.  He told me that I either have to predict the lottery numbers (via ESP), or manipulate the lottery numbers (via micro-PK).  Or maybe a combination of both.  Either way - I have to pick at least one or the other.  I theorized I had some more options - mainly intention manifestation and altering my beliefs about reality.  However, as we see, these are dead ends for the lottery.</p>
<p>So, I have a choice.  Either I can try to predict the lottery numbers, or I can affect the lottery numbers to a pre-determined set.  I have a long history of predicting the future, reading people, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that haven&#8217;t happened, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that I don&#8217;t know, and basically be bored with reality&#8217;s linear nature.  I also have a history of frustrating and unimpressive PK results.  Well gee whiz.  What should I do? <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Prediction it is!</p>
<p>It should be noted that I don&#8217;t know how I won the MegaMillions back in March.  I don&#8217;t remember if it was by prediction, or some other means.  I do know it happened right after I had the breakthrough in realizing that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; but that&#8217;s all I associate with those wins.  So I don&#8217;t know if ESP has helped me in the past with MegaMillions.</p>
<p>However, my luck with the scratch off tickets may very well have been from ESP.  When I first decided to go on my road trip to buy winning lottery tickets, I actually got a flash of the map I would end up driving before starting the trip.  I didn&#8217;t record it at the time because I was trying to focus on intention manifestation - not ESP :-P.  I didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by using ESP :-P.</p>
<p>And finally, before I end this post, I should also note that I tried to win the lottery using Remote Viewing in the past, and failed.  I did this when I was around 20 years old, and the reason I believe I failed was because of lack of skill, incorrect technique, and bad experiment design.  But hey, it was my first one, so I can&#8217;t be too hard on myself :-P.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s game time though :-P.  I&#8217;m 200x more sensitive and accurate now compared to where I was 4 years ago.  If I didn&#8217;t already know I would be correct, I would amaze myself :-P.</p>
<p>Also: if you saw my last post, then you saw my sweet ass lottery machine.  It&#8217;s in development, and not completed yet.  I shall be posting more videos as I build it.  It&#8217;s gonna kick ass :-).  Oh goodie&#8230;</p>
