perhaps not...

I disagree with you on your experiment, but I support you.</description>

		<description>Is this experiment to see how the thoughts of randomness effect the lottery, or to see if you can predict or control the lottery?
Or all 3?</description>

		<description>But did the 5 billion people always believe in randomness? When the lottery first started I'm sure there was a lot of people who thought this would be easy money. Shortly after everyone lost they realized they were wrong and that it wasn't easy. Around that time everyone started believing in randomness so it became even more random. If that's the case then how do you explain the time when everyone had high hopes believing that most of them would make money?o_O I AM SOOOOO CONFUSED!!!</description>

		<description>Or maybe the randomness is just a manifestation of itself.

When over 5 billion people believe in randomness, it manifests itself according to the intention =O</description>

		<description>Well that's definitely a quicker way to practice than waiting for the actual lottery.  (pictures this as a movie trailer) In a world where the idea of randomness runs rampant.  One man will risk everything to prove that randomness doesn't exist.  But there are some, who won't let this happen.  They'll take his wife, they'll take his kids, they'll take everything that's dear to him, even his Alan Parsons CD.  This winter, see Sean Connelly as Sean Connelly in Sean Connelly The Movie"</description>
