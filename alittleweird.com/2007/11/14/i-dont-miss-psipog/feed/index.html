		<description>Instead of regretting on what you should have done, just work toward what you want to be like.

Easy said? Not really, what is the point of regretting? You don't gain anything from it. The best thing about it could be that others get to see your mistakes and try not to make it themselves. Push yourself a little harder, keep pushing mile after mile, eventually you will pass your limit, and become a better person.

"...The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor what you desire to appear."-Socrates

You must work hard towards what you are supposed to be doing, and it is not easy to do so just keep working towards it. We are all lazy, but we are have the ability to conquer that, use the ability, do it because you are the master of your body, knowing that your body is only a vessel for success.

When you really come out and say "I can't do it", don't think of anything, just do it.
Well I just rely on my sub-conscious to do whatever I don't feel like doing ^_^, yes I am lazy just like most people, but I don't let myself down because I DO what needs to be done. Of course we fail sometimes, that makes us human, and that will contribute to our mental improvements, or so I believed ^_^


Best luck on your website Stony.</description>

		<description>This sucks.

I sleep late and find time for EVERYTHING else than psionics.
Incredible.

As if it were number n+1 on my priority list.
Occasionaly doing psi feels as motivating as throwing up just to see whether the lunch I just ate REALLY is in my stomach and didn't teleport to dimension X all the sudden when I wasn't paying attention. Something thats way too uncomfortable thing to do just to get a predictable result (that at the moment doesn't seem all that important either!)

		<description>I will definately check out PsiOnline.org and Astralsociety.com and I will post whatever insights I may have instead of being safely silent :)

The way I practice is to try and do things in an everyday sort of way.  Like getting all green lights when I drive and getting the elevator to be there immediately when I press the button. That might be TK.

I try to 'read' people when I'm with them, not constant- just long enough to get a feel for them.


And I try and usually succeed in influenceing people any time I feel like it.

My point is I never sit and try to roll a pen anymore, instead I'll try to change the weather because it's too hot or cold, I'll bust a cloud just to see if I can I'll make physical pain go away and try to get cuts to heal faster.  I don't sit and try to do something for more than a minute or two although I might repeat the process later.

and I just want to add as a final, hopefully helpful note that I found intention manifestion to be a break through for me.  Just beleiving and knowing it will happen and then letting it has made a huge difference in what I've been able to do. I think it's because all psi is really just a manipulation of energy (and energy is everything).</description>

		<description>I have been very, very guilty of this in the past, and it is just now starting to rear its ugly head.

I began my studies honestly interested in psionics, really wanting to practice, and forcing a schedule on myself. I did this because I knew in the end that I would get the results I was after.

I started to get too involved in the online community aspect and let my practices decline. Real life had a large impact too. In high school my schedule got worse and worse for me. I continued to practice, but not as much as I should have. There was a period of time where I didn't practice at all. 

I still, however, ran PsiOnline.org with the same mentality as I had when I was actually active in my practices. However, this eventually got pushed aside by real life (and by server crashes/lockouts), and my community nearly died because of it. In fact, it has still not completely recovered.

I have a friend who has taken a rather "fundamentalist" route. Maybe fundamentalist isn't the proper term, but its about as close I can get to explaining it in a short period of time. Psionics for him became a brain-washing religious/spiritual experience. Despite the way he approached it, he still practiced, he DID something. He progressed at a quick page, and I was regressing. It was at this point that I realized that I had become that lazy guy I had always ranted about. 

I was doing, nothing.

My skills were not as sharp as they used to be, my community was boring and people were leaving, all because I was too lazy. And now I'm paying the price for it.  I think back on the time I wasted NOT practicing and now I see all the potential that I had wasted.

I've been practicing again, picking up where I left off and even redoing some of the basics to clear the rust out of the pipes. I'm wondering now if PsiOnline.org will ever fully recover, or if I will for that matter. I just have to wait and see.

I think the community aspect can really take away from what is important. Not just the day to day chit chat, but things like pointless intersite politics and bickering. It all takes away from what we're supposed to be about.

		<description>This is pretty amazing. Just recently on Astralsociety.com was the issue of stagnation brought up, but we were only talking about our forum. This blog post will help broaden the picture a bit and maybe help some people understand just what is wrong with our community. Well, maybe not what's "wrong", but what "could be better".</description>

		<description>I think it's easy for you to write what you've written, and there is certainly a truth in it, but the situation is different for everybody.

Firstly, I have none to talk about "psychic" abilities, nor in the internet (you don't find many information if it's not in English) nor in real life.
Secondly, I'm getting demotivated. I'm working on OBE's every evening without result, I read a book about it, but it's just too weird. And I can't get another one if I'm not going to drive to distant bookshop. Still the literature is very limited in my language and it's mostly limited to plain stupid books.
I'm working with psi-balls, but they are non-sense to me, as I consider what I feel as being simply cramped muscles. Where is the evidence.

You see, for someone, who is into psy, and for someone who's life was changed by it, thinking and curiosity is attracted to more research, etc. 
But to me, there is no reason to spend time on it any more. Yes I know, I'm pessimistic, but I feel just plainly disappointed.</description>

		<description>I missed the large community, which I searched for else where. After a while I got bored, there really wasn't much out there that was new and exciting besides OBE. Then I started thinking up about the stuff people dont like to talk about. Eventually I started my own blog to talk about.</description>

		<description>I miss Psi-pog and I have the old forum still saved in my favorites.  Every so often I read through the old posts looking for ideas and new things to try, like programing a construct. I would have never thought of doing that by myself.

The thing I liked about Psi-pog was that a lot of the members were kids and their ideas were fresh.  There were a lot of discussions on new ways to do things.  Someone would have success with it and everyone could try it and people could share whether that technique worked or not.  

I haven't found another site like it and I have been searching.  Every site I've found is stale with old information and no new ideas. People asking questions and no one even trying to offer a solution, because they can't prove it.  So there is no exchange of ideas at all.

Sean, I think you had something great with that site.  Despite the fluff and things that couldn't be scientifically proven there was a great feeling of 'it can be done'.

I think this whole emphasis on prove it just stops the flow.  I think that spending time practising with a psi wheel is great as long as the enthusiam lasts, but once your bored with that then it won't work for you anymore.  You need to try something else.

I read once that to be able to succeed at psi is like trying to grasp water.  The harder you try to hold it the more it slips through your fingers.  So how can you consistantly prove it?

I don't know.  I don't need to prove it to myself,  I already know it's possible.  I just want to do more and I notice that with every new little success the next one is easier because the belief is stronger.

If anyone here knows of a good psi site could you post a link to it please (I mean if that's ok with you Sean).  Where did all the psi pog members go to anyway?</description>
