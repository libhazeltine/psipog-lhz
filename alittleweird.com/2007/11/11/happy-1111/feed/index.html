		<description>I've actually heard that the number 11 has significance in magick. The added "k" in magick is the 11th letter in the alphabet. 11 is beyond 10, symbolizing the unseen.</description>

		<description>People believe in something -&#62; People expect it -&#62; Intention manifestation causes some minor effects-&#62; People believe in it more and more.

Dunno. Like being a smartass though.</description>

		<description>No one should think something (especially the 2012 prophecy) is true just because so many people believe it.  Masses can easily be swayed by....well masses.  Also, 1111 is binary for 15...which just so happens to be my favorite number.  Coincidence?!  I think not!</description>

		<description>I started recognizing 23 before I knew of the movie or of any special connection to it. I only recognized it because of a character in the musical group Gorillaz ( 2D, to be exact) often has a 23 on his clothing.</description>

		<description>me and a friend of mine started yelling 23 whenever we saw it, just as a joke, and now i see it everywhere and i feel a little crazier everyday...
i agree that its the subconscious, 
if only it wasnt part of the answer of so many damn physics problems,
of course some times i dig a little bit to find the number, i interpret 2/3 as 23, and thats a common fraction, 

sometimes i feel like writing 23 over everything in charcoal...

		<description>About seeing patterns everywhere, I'm kinda the same, only with me it's the arabic letter "noon". No idea why. 
And I agree that the theories about 2012 may seem crazy, but if you look around on the net, there's just too many people who believe it. So, truth, or just a very well made practical joke? That is the question.</description>
