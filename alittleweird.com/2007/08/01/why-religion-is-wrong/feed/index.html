		<description>Christianity is a relationship, not a religion.

If you use it as a religion you are going the wrong way with it.</description>

		<description>Personally, religion set up my basic beliefs as a child. It was sort of a building block that helped me develope my own beliefs. Sure, you don't nessisarily need religion for a basis, but for some people it's what works. It enforces rules, or else it's likely you'll burn in hell. : P But it can also give people hope, family, faith, something to help them.

There is of course, the darker side of religion. It can confine you, close your mind... it can be used to gain influence for your own personal benefit, it can be corrupt, and all those sorts of things.

Like everything else, there's a negative and positive side to it.

And truth? Truth has many faces. I agree with what you said.

But do be more gentle with the bitch slapping? You'll hurt yourself. : P</description>

		<description>Cein - Thank you :-).  You've demonstrated how I'm a hypocrite :-).  Which is why I wrote about bitch-slapping myself in the post :-P.  Lots of philosophical paradoxes in the whole debate.

		<description>heyy sean, glad to see your keeping up this site after psipog
anyways onto my thoughts
i would like to say that if people knew other religions besides christianity and catholicism, they would know that some religions, such as buddhism, accept other religions and accept the knowledge that their path may lead others to what they are looking for. If you look at a lot of religions, most have the same "rules", one that is popular is the golden rule, treat others as you want to be treated, just stated different.
where am i going with this? well i believe that some people are scared, and feel vulnerable if they think they dont always have some kind of power protecting them, also reffering to antisankari, power leads to followers of your teachings. (funny how some believe that power corrupts all) Onto my point, i think that if religions keep most people from killing, stealing, causing chaos (even though some people break these "commandments" others who would too, may not break these for fear of "God") how can religions be wrong? speaking in christianity which is dominant here, ive been told you cant interperate the bible directly, there are shades of gray. so if religion helps keep order, i dont believe its wrong, but i personally dont believe that there was a jesus or God, or that being christian will get you into heaven if you're good, theres a shade of gray. I will speak my mind and say that my beliefs are all religions are bullshit that people put their faith into or are forced to believe. But those are my thoughts, think about them or not, take them as they are.

Oh and to sean, you said that truth must be attained by self, it cannot be attained by others. In saying that, are you not telling us that truth? and if that is a truth, that truth can only be attained by self, your statement therefore is false, but i attained this truth by myself, so that means its correct...?
Ouch...headache</description>

		<description>I see. Thank you for your reply, Nezz, it is all very interesting to me. 

We are all surrounded by different regional, cultural, and societal, influences, which in turns yields a large variety of different perspective, I believe.

I think that if our opinions are painted in colours, the above comments when taken in conjunction with one another would look like a stained glass in a church. Very colourful. Though some of them look like different shades of the same colour to me, but interesting nonetheless.</description>

		<description>dont really need to have a PHD in world religions to know that most worship one or more gods. I dont know all of the religions out there. I am trying to study, in my free time, what religions are out there and what they believe in as a fyi kinda thing because its a thing that seems to run many ppl's lives. but basically my conclusions I have made in previous posts are based on what I currently know about religion and religions im pretty familiar with. As far as experiance, I have a family broken up by religion, some Christian, some Catholic, some Jahovas Witness and some just plain confused all together in what they believe in lol.

if you want to sum it up to something measureable, then id say i would have an associates degree in wolrd religion while maintaining a B+ average :D</description>

		<description>Don't forget about the crustacean, Daemon. They are abominations too (Leviticus 11:10) and can send you to hell. That is, until Jesus died for you. And if you ask me, I'm willing to get myself killed for you/everyone-else, even though I owe you and possibly many other people nothing, if it means I will have people like yourself raving for me thousands of years after my death and revering me as God.

That aside,

I have just one question that I really want to ask of those present: For those of you that name and mention religion that is not your own (whether you actually have one or not aside), just how much do you actually know of the said religion, or any other religion beside your own?

For an example, if you are a Christian, how much do you actually know of, say.. Buddhism? Or if you are a Buddhist, how much do you know and understand of Christianity? 

Personally, I think that it is probable that most religion might ultimately be categorically similar at it's core, but I assumed that it might be a dangerous thing to do, basing conclusions on incomplete information. So, with some of my reasons explained, I'd like to know your (the current reader of this sentence) opinion and experience.</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A agree with you Nezz. The thing I hate the most about religion is the narrow mindedness of people. If religious people killed everyone they considered evil we would still be wiping our asses with leaves and believing that universe revolves around us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some relatives that are very religious. They are so narrow minded they do not believe in micro evolution (the idea that all living creatures can trade DNA and during times of extreme environmental condition be reduced), super position theory (aka Schrodinger's cat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat ), and even M-theory ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so horrible. People have no faith in each other as it is. Throw in religion and idiots start to pop out of no where. If there was a theory that could prove that heaven was real and so was hell, religious idiots would be the first to strike it down by saying it was the devil's work to stray people from religion. People blame those who don't aren't religious as evil. But most of the "evil" people out there realized what I did: If you want something done right you do it your self. No one can help you but you. Somethings you can't control like accidents and bad luck, but you can adjust your feelings toward them and turn it into a positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that really irritates me is when people look at those in jail and prison and assume that they are there because god is punishing them. When inmates try to get religion some say that it's not "true". But the everyday church goer forgets that their life could have been different then a inmates. Many religious and non religious people are so close minded they assume that most people in jail are in there because of their doings. But if they had enough money to eat decent meals and had lived in good neighborhoods with a loving wife, would they still be in the same position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess what bothers me is just close-mindedness. Well I hope everyone blindly follows what I say and calls all else heresy XD&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>My belief is this, there are only two paths leading to heaven.  That's right, you don't have to be a Christian, you have a choice.  Your choices are:

1)Be perfect from birth, and continue to do so.  This means that;

     -You have no gods other then Jehovah, Yahweh, I AM, whatever name       
      you prefer to use, the one and only God.  
     -You have never made an idol, or worshiped any idols.  Keep in 
      mind that ANYTHING can be an idol.
     -You have never used the Lord's name in vain.
     -You have kept the sabbath day holy, meaning you don't work on 
      it, use it simply for relaxing and being with the Lord.
     -You always have respected your mother and father.
     -You have never killed, hating someone in your heart is counted
      as murder.
     -You have never committed adultery, sex outside of marriage, and
      have never had lustful thoughts about a person.
     -You have never stolen, no matter the value.
     -You have never lied, even if it was "for a good reason".
     -You never coveted another's persons possesions or any aspect of 
      their life.

That's one option that you have.  If you think you still have a chance at it, go for it, but ANY straying and that path is gone, you strayed from the path, and you only have one option left...

2)So you've somehow messed up, your a sinner just like us all.  The first option isn't going to work for you.  Unfortunately there is nothing that any man can do to change that for himself.  But because Jesus Christ died for us, and took all of the sins of every person that was/will ever be born and then rose from the dead, hell not able to hold him because he himself was without sin and is the son of God, we have another chance. All we have to do is repent of our sins, believing in our hearts and minds that God is real, that Jesus died for us, and that we are sinners and we need him to get to heaven.  Just give your life over to God.

Seem unreasonable to you?  Think a little bit harder, God owes us NOTHING but has died for us, and offered us eternal life.  If you ask me its US who owe HIM.

Now a lot of you will dismiss this as nothing, because there is no "proof" of God.  He isn't something that you can see, much like the wind.  You cannot see the wind, you only see the effects of the wind.  The way that a Christian knows that god is real is EXPERIENCE.  If someone tells a child that a stove is hot, and the child believes them, the child has now entered the realm of belief.  Out of curiosity though, because they want to know what hot feels like, the child touches the stove, and burns their hand.  Now the child has experienced hot, and if someone else comes to them and tells them that the stove isn't hot, they can't be fooled, they know, they have experienced it (this stove is always on =D).  This is the same way that a Christian knows God is real.  They have experienced Him moving in their life.  

Christianity is not a religion as the world might categorize it.  It's a lifestyle, it's the truth.  Christianity is people dedicating their lives to God, who without they would not live.  So you still have a chance to get on the right path, there's people out there trying to lead you to it.  If you have any questions I suggest speaking to a local pastor.  Or email me, that's more fun for me =D

Christianity is people dedicating their lives to God, who without they would not live.  So you still have a chance to get on the right path, there&#8217;s people out there trying to lead you to it.  If you have any questions I suggest speaking to a local pastor.  Or email me, that&#8217;s more fun for me =D</p>
