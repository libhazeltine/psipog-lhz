		<description>I like it , it keeps people interested until the very end and you get your point across. Not to mention it doesn't indicate anything about what the site actually covers, wich leaves viewers wanting to see for themselves what your site is all about. Great job</description>

		<description>I think it was too short and got to the point TOO QUICKLY!!!

You guys just think you see Sean everywhere because he's astrally projecting himself into those positions.  He's like an agent in the matrix!

Or could it be your subconscious placing Sean and his topics at the forefront of your mind, telling you to spend more time focusing on these things rather than fireworks, music, or clothing.</description>

		<description>Whoa, this is weird, because I could've sworn I've seen him at a local fair selling balloons, a hair saloon getting his haircut, and at an alabama airport.</description>

		<description>You know, Sean, you also look like this guy I saw working at a store called Vintage Stock. And you also look like this guy I saw selling fireworks. But, it was probably somebody else.</description>
