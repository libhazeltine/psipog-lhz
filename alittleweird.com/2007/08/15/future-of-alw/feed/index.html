		<description>Hmmm, very interesting comments.  I didn't realize some of you guys preferred this format.

I'll think some more on this issue.  Perhaps I/we can think of a better medium than plain old forums.  I want to grow, but I do agree that forums can get excessive.

More thought :-).</description>

		<description>I guess I agree with fate in that sean throws something out to us and we get to play with it. It's like a bunch of dogs fighting over a piece of meat or something... things are interesting. You give us to much to eat, and we stop complaining because there is more to go around.

I guess I don't care if you make a forum, but I think this sort of thing works. And requires less setup really.</description>

		<description>"wtf? i have no idea what fate just said..
stop being so uptight and just talk like a normal person.."

I was afraid of that, actually. But unfortunately, just as you can't understand what I just said, I can't really convey my thoughts well in other format. Or at least it feels unnatural to me.

I can try though, but no promises.</description>

		<description>i also like they way things are, but having forums won't actually change that in any way will it? i mean, it's just added something new. and even if it doesn't work out, it shouldn't ruin what we have here.</description>

		<description>I don't know if forums are such a good idea... When it comes to forums about the paranormal, it can get really repetitive or off-topic (like jesse said), or sometimes, plain old stupid imho.

Personally, I like what's going on right now.. Where Sean writes something and people respond through the comments.</description>

		<description>Looks like I am a step too late in becoming the first dissenting voice. Personally, I do not like forums, they are to me a stressful and sometimes inane medium of communication. I have never posted on PsiPog before, though instead I choose to post here on A Little Weird when the chance presented itself. The reason for that is simple, this medium allows for a more invested form of communication, a slightly more intimate form of contact, in my opinion.

The format of ALW up till now have always been one where PeeBrain (you don't mind if I continue calling you that, do you?) think of something, or simply felt like it, and throw us a nugget of his thoughts and we proceed to provide our various opinions on it. 

It is an incredibly simple medium but yet insightful at the same time, allowing several dozen contrasting views to be shed on a single topic led in a way by one conscious thought. A little bit like a mind coming up with an idea and several dozen little voices begin to tear it up and provide different spectrum of insight on it. 

Though I must agree that, as I have cited in an earlier comment, the different spectrum of light sometimes look like each other, and seem hellbent on intensifying itself more than sharing a myriad perspective on a single issue. However, I believe that the current format is not essentially flawed, the fact that you (referring to PeeBrain) began to openly encourage differing views might open up a floodgate for people who did not wish before to share some of their thoughts in fear of being ridiculed or ostracized.

I do not have suggestion for what I think ALW should evolve into, but I think evolution requires time and it might be a little early to decide the direction ALW should go. In time, I believe, we might begin to see the trend forming into the then obvious direction ALW would be taking.</description>
