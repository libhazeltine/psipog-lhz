		<description>I hate when I have hypnagogic experiences!  They happen at about 3 a.m. for me every once in a while.  They normally involve some living thing (such as a giant bug) in my bed.  Then I get all scared and angry then try to get rid of it, but then I realize it was just a dream, then I go back to sleep.  I now recall another instance that something like that happened.  When I was about 8, it was almost Christmas, and I was at my grandparent's house with my parents.  I was sleeping on the couch, when I heard voices.  The voices were that of my parents and grandparents.  They were talking about me, saying I should wake up, but when I opened my eyes, it'd stop.  Eventually, I fell asleep.  I hate hallucinations...</description>

		<description>I get these before I fall asleep or when I close my eyes and I'm really sleepy, and they are usually more realistic than my visualizations. However, most of the time it's still not 100% clear like I'm seeing with my eyes. I can still tell they're just in my head... maybe i need to reach a deeper level?</description>

		<description>i've had a few visual hypnopompic experiences (hypnopompia being the same as hypnagogia, only it's when you wake up instead of when you go to sleep) one of them was just a panning view of an ocean with impressive waves. the other was some random views of stars. 
interesting thing though, i've been very near sighted since birth, so these hallucinations were actually clearer then what i'd expect to see IRL.


i've never actually had a hypnagogic experience though, nor an OBE. i've tried, but it always takes me ages to get to reach a near sleep state. even on nights where i just want to sleep it takes ages. i just can't hold a trance long enough. anyone know any way i might be able to get to sleep sooner?</description>

		<description>Very cool.  I wondered what that was called..I've always heard these kind of voice-hallucinations when I was on the edge of sleep, but I've never really been able to focus in on them.  Trying to would usually bring me out of it and I'd have to get back into the state again.  
Now that I think of it, the first time I had an OBE was when I was listening to the radio..  Maybe I'll try listening to trace before I sleep and see if it helps.  Thanks Sean, your blogs are always awesome.

(On a different subject, I sent an email to you a week or two ago. If you get a free moment, could you read/respond to it please? The subject was "Thoughts On Ones Intention Vrs Others()".  Thank you if you can. I'd appreciate it.)</description>

		<description>I would think it depends on the question you're asking.

Also, I'm gonna try this for a few nights.  If anything happens I'll post it here later =)</description>

		<description>I tried trancing out last night before bed and I had some pretty crazy dreams, when I woke up I felt like I hadn't slept at all. 

Just thought I'd share my results :)</description>

		<description>Hmm, that is intersting. I don't think I've experienced any of these hallucinations before (except maybe slight tactile sensations during trance/meditation).

"If you want to experience something truly weird, then trance out before you go to bed at night. Don’t have any expectations. Just trance out."

Saying that actually creates one expectation right away: a weird experience.
To not have any expectation is also to not hope to experience something weird (in this case).
Just thought I'd point that out. :)</description>

		<description>That's so cool. I always heard "you gotta get in a trance to blah and blah" and now I know that I've had one. I listen to Trance music alot so i guess im sorta trying to be chill like Yoh from Shaman King, but he listens to reggae ^_^. Hypnagogia is fun but I dont like the sleep paralysis too much, maybe I can take control from there :p
for anyone interested, I usually listen to "http://www.di.fm"'s Goa-Psy trance channel.</description>

		<description>Interesting to read this. I've always wondered what that falling sensation was, which I sometimes have when I wake up. When I try to get the feeling, it's gone. strange.

I will definitely try this.</description>
