		<description>Now the following is inspired by a book by James H. Brennan, Astral Projection.

He claims that the self has to areas in which it acts:
a)the phsyical world, though our 5 senses.
b)the astral world, trough our imagination.

This means, that we can manipulate the astral world trough visualization, which then affects the physical world. (oversimplified)

that way you can also create a "light body", in which you can project your awareness and have a sort of OBE.

Just an idea to think about. I didn't explain in detail because it would fill half a book. ;)</description>

		<description>As for the subconscious... 

Stacks of intention manifestation books claim that the reason visualization works is because you're essentially telling your subconscious mind what you want, and so with enough visual/emotional repetition, the subconscious realizes your wish and creates it in the material world. Now, if you have a link with your subconscious, it seems intention manifestation should be as easy as repeatedly telling it "hey, I wanna win the lottery." 
Well, judging by your troubles it's obviously not as easy as that.. So maybe that voice in your head is something else entirely. Or the intention manifestation book's theorizing got it all wrong.

But yeah, enough with the theories and more with action. I like that conclusion. :P</description>

		<description>For me, the voice isn't very distant, and sounds a lot like my own. Although sometimes it sounds deeply detached.

 In addition, what about the idea of 'selfless' acts. Don't we, as the selfish bastards we are, ultimately do everything we do for ourselves?</description>

		<description>My intuition says similar things to me all the time: skepticism becomes a box; wrong or right isn't as important as doing etc. Thats a rough translation. I'm always amazed at how distinct the voice is from my own. 

Thanks, Sean, you taught me to do it at psipog.</description>

		<description>Assuming that was your subconcious talking about that, would you be interested in an updated article about the subconcious? The previous ones aren't oriented for learning about them, but rather experiencing them without much headroom as to what to expect.

My questions:

 How do you really know if it is your subconcious?

What does it really feel like to speak to your subconcious? For me, it usually sounds like a variation of my own voice, although sometimes I do get more detailed information in the form of wordless thoughts.

What do you think it is? I use the term subconcious because I think that is what it is, but it tends to know things that you yourself don't. Robert Peterson refers to it as his Inner Voice, while Robert Monroe seems to think it is his ultimate self, guiding his smaller buddy around. If that's true, what would you think of that?

It also brings to question free will and thought. With all of the scientific laws, the subconcious seems like an addition to that list of things that control you, instead of vice versa.  How does that go?</description>

		<description>"Just Do It." -- qft

Also, from what I've read of others' experiences with intention manifestation and the like, apparently when training, it helps to not only visualize the event or circumstance youre working toward (Im purposefully avoiding the word "want") but also to be very clear about how you feel when this happens and what you will do next. Really play the whole event out when you're doing your training and make it as real as possible. So much so that you EXPECT the outcome that you are intending and you will literally be surprised if it doesn't happen.

As long as you wait to see the numbers to see if you've won, you're allowing room for not winning. It'd be a bit much to expect you to do this without any doubt, but I believe that putting yourself in the mindset of ALREADY having the outcome you're shooting for is definitely beneficial.

You could go out and start spending like you already are a millionaire... but unless you're in touch enough with your subconcious to know if you really believe it, that could backfire pretty hard ;)

GL to you and potential (and whomever else is playing), for whatever thats worth :)</description>
