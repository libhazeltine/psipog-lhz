				<p>So what are my lottery results thus far?</p>
<p>I started the lottery project in March.  It&#8217;s now August.  I&#8217;ve played 40 MegaMillion tickets, and a bunch of scratch off tickets.  Of the $40 spent on MegaMillions, I&#8217;ve won $10 (from my 4th and 5th ticket purchased).  All others have been losers.  I&#8217;ve spent $77 on scratch off tickets, and won $113.  If you do the math, that means my entire project is showing a profit of $6.  At it&#8217;s peak, it was boasting around a $70 profit&#8230; but that has slowly dwindled down.</p>
<p>My interest in the project wavers in and out - just like any project that takes prolonged effort.  I&#8217;m glad I made the rule to stop playing when the jackpot is under $45 million.  This allows me to take some time off and think about other things, and then approach it with new effort when it&#8217;s in my range.</p>
<p>My biggest winnings have come from the scratch off tickets.  I think the reason for this is because it&#8217;s simply easier :-P.  The ticket is already winning before I purchase it, and I can hone in on winning tickets.  MegaMillions is an entirely different game.  I must either predict the correct numbers, or force my numbers to come up.  I perceive this as a harder game.  Whether or not the game itself is objectively &#8220;harder&#8221; is unknown&#8230; all I know is that from my perspective, it is harder.</p>
<p>It might make sense to play more scratch off tickets, since that&#8217;s where I have more &#8220;luck&#8221;.  That&#8217;s just not what I want to do though.  Scratch offs don&#8217;t pay as much, and they are harder to measure from a mathematical standpoint.  They also toy with your emotion :-P.  Of course, maybe that&#8217;s a good thing..?</p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important observation: I have no clue what direction to move in.  Intention manifestation had the most results with the scratch off, but it didn&#8217;t really help with MegaMillions.  The only winnings I had in MegaMillions happened the two drawings after I came to the realization that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist.  So maybe I should attempt to have more realizations?  I try, but either my new realizations aren&#8217;t correct, or don&#8217;t help :-P.  I haven&#8217;t won :-P.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to gauge my progress.  I don&#8217;t know how to tell whether I&#8217;m not I&#8217;m moving in the correct direction.  For example - if your goal is to learn to play guitar, then it&#8217;s pretty easy to gauge your progress.  Listen to yourself play - do your fingers move faster?  Does it sound nicer?  Then you&#8217;re doing good.  However, with the lottery, it&#8217;s a little more tricky.  The only gauge I have is whether I win or not.  If I don&#8217;t win, then I can&#8217;t tell if what I did the few days before actually helped or not.  Maybe I&#8217;m moving in the correct direction, but I&#8217;m not winning because I haven&#8217;t moved far enough along?  Or maybe I&#8217;m way off base have to turn around?  I simply don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong, randomness does exist, and I&#8217;m doing all this for nothing :-|.  Naaa! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep trying.  It&#8217;s such a small investment that it would be silly to quit.  I literally pay for my tickets using a bucket of spare change.  So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going broke over it :-P.</p>
<p>I like the project because it&#8217;s challenging.  It&#8217;s a good goal, and it&#8217;s forcing me to move in all directions to find a solution.  I&#8217;m not sure if a solution actually exists&#8230; but I&#8217;m learning a lot along the way, and I have nothing better to do&#8230; so no harm done.  And it&#8217;s fun.  I&#8217;ve become a better person in the process as well - I&#8217;ve been exercising regularly, I&#8217;ve learned how to compose music, and I try to have patience with my roommate&#8217;s cats :-).  It might seem unrelated on the surface, but when I say I&#8217;m moving in &#8220;all directions&#8221;, I mean it :-P.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t won the jackpot yet, though.  If a solution does exist, then I will find it.</p>

			<p>Yay! First post! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So you&#8217;ve done this for 12*12 days!!! Wow. That&#8217;s what I call perseverance! Just keep going. One day, you&#8217;ll find a solution. Giving up all your gained knowledge about reality now, just because you&#8217;re loosing, or throwing models out of the window, would be ridiculous. I wish you all the best!</p>
<p>Hey&#8230; If the lottery makes you a better person, why not keep going :p. I firmly believe in karma, and a good person could only win :).</p>

			<p>Maybe you should practice micro-pk. See what seems to work and what doesn&#8217;t. Take a deck of cards, lay them out and see if you can guess the correct cards in a consistent fashion. Study your state of mind when it works. Practice in as many ways you can think of and when you get killer awesome at it then try to intention the correct numbers for the lottery.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s funny you should mention that, Hey_you&#8230; actually, I was doing that for a while.  I was getting really good at it too.  What I would do was ignore the suit of the card, and just call out the face as I turned it over.  Probability states I should get about 4 correct, from random guessing.  I would consistently get around 6 or 7, never below 4, and sometimes as high as 10 or 12.  I stopped practicing though.  I forget why.  Maybe I&#8217;ll start up again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think the reason for this is because it’s simply easier.</p>
<p>MegaMillions is an entirely different game.  I must either predict the correct numbers, or force my numbers to come up.  I perceive this as a harder game.  Whether or not the game itself is objectively “harder” is unknown… all I know is that from my perspective, it is harder.</p>
<p>So maybe I should attempt to have more realizations?  I try, but either my new realizations aren’t correct, or don’t help.</p>
<p>However, with the lottery, it’s a little more tricky.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if a solution actually exists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I think by now youre pretty aware that the strength of an intention and/or will for an outcome are rooted pretty heavily in how/what you believe about them. (ive enjoyed what youve had to say since the psipog days, hope im not out of line by assuming this)</p>
<p>in my opinion, by your own admission you are limiting yourself. the reason i copied out those quotes is because i believe they are telling of your underlying beliefs about this situation. which i also believe ultimately affect your final results.</p>
<p>if you felt the same way about scratch-offs as you did mega millions, ID bet that you would get similar results. and i hope im not out of line by assuming you also agree that saying you believe in something and truly believing it are two very different things&#8230; that in mind, i would think that even if you could &#8220;say&#8221; that you felt similar about them, id argue that deep down your rationalization of the complexity of MM would intrinsicly judge that system as &#8220;harder&#8221; to manipulate. i know it would for me because objectively it IS more complex.</p>
<p>however, with intention and belief none of that matters. it matters only to the point that it affects YOUR intentions and beliefs, no more. if truly, throughout your whole being, you felt as if there was no hurdle and no &#8220;difficulty&#8221; in earning an &#8220;intended win&#8221; on the MM, i am certain you would. but, to me at least, it is clear you do not feel that way&#8230; </p>
<p>for this there could be infinite reasons. you feel its more complex, you feel its harder, you would feel like youre cheating others, you would not feel like you earned it, you would feel like you didnt build up to that skill level, you dont really want to win, you enjoy drawing out the experience, you believe that others intentions will affect who wins, you feel scared of the ramifications of confirming such a powerful possibility, etc, etc. of course those may be the types of things i could personally see as being limiting factors coming from my thought process and background, but it doesnt exclude that you may have a whole other set of limiters.</p>
<p>long story short, i suppose it seems to me that until you do believe you can and it is easy, it wont be. i know you already know this and that sounds rather simplistic, but i dont think that changes the importance of it.</p>
<p>if you had absolutely no reservations and no doubt that you could and will do it, then of course it will happen. getting there, though, you may require the idea of earning and learning, in which case trial and error and &#8220;progress&#8221; are tools necessary in creating the belief structure that will allow a MM win.</p>
<p>if you want a challenge, you will have one. if you want to feel like you accomplished something, you will require an obstacle. if your faith were so unwavering that you could win the MM at will, you probably wouldnt be bothering with something so trivial <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>p.s. keep at it, i very much enjoy your blog. definitely a source of inspiration for those of us that think along the same lines <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>the problem with using intention manifestation with MM though is that you are, to some degree, going against everyone else that wants to win MM. granted, most of them probably aren&#8217;t as good at it as you are, or even realise they&#8217;re doing it. but if they want to win, some level of intention manifestation should be there. in other words, it&#8217;s your IM vs. the IM of everyone that has different numbers to you.</p>
<p>at least, thats the way i see it. but then i&#8217;m usually very wrong about this sort of stuff, so who knows &gt;.&gt;</p>

<p>You, kind sir, live up to your name.  *ponders*</p>
<p>I read your comment when you first posted it and thought you cut through me pretty good.  Then I came back to it again today, and re-read my post.  I&#8217;m even more convinced that you&#8217;ve nailed a glaring blind spot in my perception.  Thank you! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>have you ever listened to some of wayne dyers lecture tapes?  i have a ton on audiobook if you want ill host em for you.  Im kinda slightly skeptic of the wave of self help gurus these days but his words definitely ring true to me.. and the tactics have produced results. </p>
<p>These are the strongest points ive gathered from his lectures-</p>
<p>-Want more for others then you want for yourself<br />
-Think from the end result of what you want<br />
-Be an appreciator<br />
-stay amongst good energy<br />
-Dont resist<br />
-surround yourself with conditions you want<br />
-understand allowing events that you think arent in your favor<br />
-express radical humility<br />
-never condemn a problem<br />
ect..  </p>
<p>try practicing those for a while and see how it goes.</p>

			<p>not sure if this has been commented or not<br />
i lack the effort right now to try<br />
to much drama with to many people</p>
<p>HOWEVER!</p>
<p>i think i have a possible solution to gauging your progress</p>
<p>the megamillions used a combinations of &#8220;randomly&#8221; picked numbers right</p>
<p>so play around with it a bit,<br />
see how close your numbers are to the winning, or if you have all the winning numbers and they are just out of order.</p>
<p>and you are totally right about the non-existence of random anything</p>
<p>random generating computer chips in slot machines and any other computer device arent truly random<br />
they are all based on a complex algorithm allowing them to have varied answers, but all are predictable if you recognize the pattern</p>
<p>hope i helped<br />

			<p>I still haven&#8217;t won more than 10 dollars each time we play even though we do win something every single time.  There have been so many times that we are so unbelievably close and its so frustrating.  We will have a ticket with two numbers and the power ball and the rest of the numbers will be 1 digit off each.  Sadly its rarely the same direction though.  One will be 1 number lower than the chosen number and the other will be 1 number higher than the chosen number.  i go in and out on wanting this too.</p>
<p>IO have had some interesting manifestations though.  I play the powerball and I thought it might help with I tried to manifest winning tickets in the states I buy the tickets in and the next two winning tickets were in those two states.  One of them was bought at a gas station we sometimes buy from, we just didn&#8217;t get it.  Another interesting result was 1 year ago exactly I did a manifestation to win the powerball at the 300 million mark.  Well I figured I should give that at least a year.  Interestingly enough it hit the 300 million mark this month, exactly one year from the original manifestation.  I just didn&#8217;t win it, lol.</p>
