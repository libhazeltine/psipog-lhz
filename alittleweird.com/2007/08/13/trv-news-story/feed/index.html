		<description>I've heard a lot of people say psionics are evil as well. But, your just sitting and thinking. That is like saying Algebra is satanic.</description>

		<description>That's just freakin sweet. I always sucked at RVing. Shes pretty good, or at least better then me. A big reason people find psionics ad the like to be nonexistant is probably in part of the language used. "You made a believer out of me...", "well offcially they dont exist,yet there starting to use them more to solve crimes,unlock secrets etc.so y dont people just believe". It's got nothing to know about a persons beliefs but more to do with just knowledge. 

With many Christians like my parents, thy believe that psionics is the work of the devil. It's kind of funny though, if you see the future as a prophet of god you are amazing and holy, but if you do the same thing without god behind you they wanna hang you for being the devil. &#62;.</description>

		<description>Ah! That's such a useful video to have around. I saw another news report on a woman who ran a bar and often caused lights to flicker and break, watches to stop, and that sort of thing. I'll have to go find it and drop it by.</description>

		<description>Couldn't have said it better myself AntiSankari. 

Psychic phenomena has already been validated scientifically to a degree, experiments in telepathy and pk been have shown to be statistically significant. Something weird is going on, mainstream science doesn't want to listen and the world at large doesn't understand it so they ignore it. More experiments need to be done but the government won't fund that kind of research because they don't understand it and so they ignore it.</description>

		<description>The biggest miracle in psychic scene seems to be its ability to be like that huge elephant in the middle of a room that nobody wants to talk about...

Heck.

Government does these things, scientists do these things, even random people do these things. Still, officially they dont exist!

A little weird, huh?</description>
