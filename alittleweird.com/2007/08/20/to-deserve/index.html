				<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling with this idea of &#8220;deserving to win the lottery&#8221; for a little while now, and I&#8217;ve finally found the solution.  First, let me describe my original conflict.</p>
<p>With intention manifestation, some say it&#8217;s important to feel as though you <em>deserve</em> whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to manifest.  My problem with this idea is that to feel as though you <em>deserve</em> something is really asking for trouble.  It&#8217;s being rude to reality.  It&#8217;s my belief that reality will determine what you deserve, using precise and exact judgment.  If you feel as though you deserve something, and reality disagrees, then you&#8217;re setting yourself up for disappointment and suffering.</p>
<p>So my solution to that was to never feel as though I deserved anything.  I hated seeing people do nothing and feel as though they deserve something.  It&#8217;s rude.  If you want something, then go after it.  Work hard for it, and attain it.  It seemed as though this feeling of &#8220;deserving&#8221; would get in the way.  Whenever I think of it, I envision a bad employee who always complains about how they deserve a raise, or deserve longer breaks, or more benefits.  Quit complaining, and go get it!  Stop wallowing, stop feeling as though you deserve something you haven&#8217;t earned, and get off your ass and do something about it!</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230;</p>
<p>Those were my old thoughts.  I still like most of them, but I&#8217;ve altered them slightly now that I&#8217;ve found a solution.</p>
<p>I now agree that it&#8217;s important to feel as though you deserve whatever you&#8217;re intending to manifest.  And my negativity associated with &#8220;deserving&#8221; has been removed.  Let me explain my new thoughts&#8230; (sorry if this turns out to be a little long-winded):</p>
<p>I live in Maryland, and went on vacation in Georgia, where my family lives.  We went to see an Atlanta Braves baseball game, and I couldn&#8217;t help but notice all the attractive females walking around :-).  One thing I really miss about Georgia is all the smoking hot females.  Of all the places I&#8217;ve lived, Georgia definitely has the most beautiful women.</p>
<p>I was also admiring the skill of the baseball players.  I was thinking about how hard they worked to achieve their goal of playing in the majors.  How much training and hard work they must have gone through, just to perform gracefully and correctly.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I tried to imagine a world where every person lived up to their potential.  Where every single person found their dream job, and worked hard to achieve their goals.  Where every person exercised, ate healthy, and was beautiful.  I tried to imagine what that world would be like.  Would it be better than our world?  What would it be like if every last person on the planet was successful to their highest potential?</p>
<p>My mind started to create this world, so I could see how it would function.  First I envisioned a baseball pitcher becoming the best he could&#8230; throwing the fastest and most precise pitches.  Then I thought how this perfect pitcher would strike everyone out&#8230; But then I remembered - the batter would also live up to his highest potential.  Each player would be the perfect batter, and could hit any pitch exactly where they wanted.  I saw that baseball would still exist in this perfect world, because competition would still be valid.  Perfect players playing against perfect players still produces a great game.</p>
<p>Then I started to think about perfect females.  Then I envisioned myself living up to my potential.  Healthy, strong, smart, fun, compassionate, etc.  Everything maxed out.  While looking out over the crowd of fans, I envision every man and women in the stands as living up to their potential.  I imagined all of us had achieved all our goals, and were living healthy and happy lives.</p>
<p>After playing this out in my head for a while, I realized that it would be a pretty kick ass place to live in.  Everyone would be happy, and there would be very little problems in the world.  We would all be rich.  We would all support each other.  It would be really great.</p>
<p>This was when I realized the real meaning of the word &#8220;deserve&#8221;.  I realized that we all deserve to live in a world like that.  I deserve to live up to my highest potential.  But you, the reader, also deserve me to live up to my highest potential.  And I deserve you to live up to yours.  And you deserve it as well.</p>
<p>I realized that I actually deserve to win the lottery.  But so does anyone else who also sets that as a goal.  It&#8217;s not really about earning it&#8230; it&#8217;s more about realizing that the world could be like my day dream.  It&#8217;s possible for all of us to live in a world where each person has lived up to their potential.  We all need to work for it.  You deserve to accomplish your goals because they are your goals!  And I deserve to have a reader who has accomplished their goals!  So don&#8217;t let me down :-P.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m not explaining it correctly.  My old thought pattern was that you get what you deserve.  Reality determines what you deserve.  So don&#8217;t complain about what you&#8217;re looking at, because reality has served it to you.  If you think you deserve something else, then work for it.</p>
<p>My new thought pattern is that it&#8217;s possible for us to live in a world where everyone has lived up to their potential.  And we deserve to simply because it&#8217;s possible.  We shouldn&#8217;t settle for any less.  We can create a perfect world, so we must.  Anything less wouldn&#8217;t be fair.  From this root, I see that I deserve to win the lottery, simply because it&#8217;s my goal, and I deserve to accomplish my goals.  It&#8217;s on my path towards living up to my potential.  And you deserve a webmaster who has lived up to his potential!  So I won&#8217;t let you down :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea for me, because I&#8217;m not used to thinking like this.  I&#8217;m sure many of you out there have realized what I&#8217;ve written in your own unique ways.  But I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve finally realized it for myself :-).   Step 1. Randomness doesn&#8217;t exist.  Step 2. I deserve to live up to my potential.  Step 3&#8230;.? <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>(Also: After finishing this post, I just checked my most recent lottery ticket.  I won $2.  Odds 1 in 75.  I haven&#8217;t won money from MegaMillions since I realized that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist :-P.  I think I&#8217;m on the right track.)</p>

			<p>I think you made a good point here.<br />
I&#8217;ve been struggling with the idea of deserving for a long time and your concept of &#8220;creating a better world by granting people their intentions&#8221;(oversimplified of course ;)) seems to be a way out of that impasse.</p>
<p>Still I think your idea is somewhat to simple. We must not simply want something to deserve it, we must realize why we want it and we must realize the consequences of what we want to deserve it.</p>
<p>all though that&#8217;s a big part of intentions, but I still feel that they are also in relation with deserving your intention.</p>

			<p>What you think you deserve and what you actually deserve are two completely different things. Also, if everyone is 100% what they could be, then everyone is on the same level. It wouldn&#8217;t really be any different than what people are doing now. Also, the idea of what is worthwhile in life is different for different people. Maybe the true meaning of life is to live with no possesions. Maybe it is to be rich&#8230; </p>
<p>Random thought: Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. What do humans have that other species do not? KNOWLEDGE. what if knowledge and technology are sin?</p>

			<p>&#8220;My new thought pattern is that it’s possible for us to live in a world where everyone has lived up to their potential. And we deserve to simply because it’s possible. We shouldn’t settle for any less. We can create a perfect world, so we must.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe that choice is at the heart of your issue.</p>
<p>I agree that it is very possible for each of us to live up to our potential, as well as live in a world in which all others have as well. However, the only reason such is not the case is because many(most) choose not to do so. The great majority probably do not realize it is even a possibility nor are they aware it is their choice, and still more probably have yet to simply step up to the plate.</p>
<p>Your old thought process regarding deservedness assumed that reality was the one dishing out experience. The problem I see here is that with this line of thought reality makes choices of its own accord and serves them to you regardless of your input. Simply saying &#8220;move on, make it happen&#8221; when reality gives you a lemon implies that the person does deserve their &#8220;bad&#8221; situation, but that &#8220;putting in the effort&#8221; will rectify that. In this construct, what is the change that is making reality no longer in charge? If reality says, &#8220;You &#8216;deserve&#8217; situation-A&#8221; and you feel as though you &#8220;deserve&#8221; situation-B&#8230; who wins? Reality? If reality decides, then working toward situation-B would be futile, since reality has already passed judgement and youve got what you &#8220;deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>To say that &#8220;putting in the work&#8221; and &#8220;making change&#8221; will adjust reality&#8217;s judgement of what you deserve puts the reigns back in your hands. To me this sounds too inconsistent to really hold. But, I think that has something to do with your new line of thought and I believe that it plays well with the idea of choice.</p>
<p>If you do 100mph on the highway and get pulled over you get a ticket. If you tell the officer that you did not know the speed limit was 65 (and honestly did not)&#8230; you still get a ticket. It was your choice to go 100&#8230; being unaware that you were breaking the law does not mean you didn&#8217;t choose to do it. Same goes with reality. If you live a life where you are constantly downtrodden or given the short end of the stick, or if you live a life that is one &#8220;lucky&#8221; turn after another; you are getting what you &#8220;deserve.&#8221; The reason you deserve it, is because you have chosen it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would someone choose to be in misery? That makes no sense.&#8221; Again, simply because you (and/or the person in said situation) are unaware of the purpose of any given circumstance does not invalidate that it was indeed a choice. If someone has a mindset and belief system that they are a loser, or they are undeserving, or that pain or suffering are what is right for them, they will bring that upon themselves at every turn. Deep down they BELIEVE that is what should be happening, and thus reality serves them what they DECIDE that they &#8220;deserve.&#8221; If you asked them what they wanted, they would say, &#8220;Happiness, abundance, out of this situation, etc., etc.&#8221; as anyone would. But deep inside, at their core, do they truly believe that is what they should be having? Do they really choose that? If they did, they would have it. If they do not believe they do, and worse yet they continue &#8220;wanting&#8221; out of it, then they will continue spinning their wheels and running into the same &#8220;problems&#8221; over and over. If you tell reality that you &#8220;want&#8221; something, reality will create the circumstance to oblige&#8230; a circumstance that allows you to WANT. If you have something, you no longer want it&#8230; but you say you want it&#8230; make up your mind! Choose to have it, not to want it.</p>
<p>This gets into some sticky territory because using this line of thinking means that people whom great travesties have been committed upon must somehow/someway be willing to be a party to them. I would say that that is true. Why? Maybe only they will know. If you subscribe to ideas like an eternal soul and reincarnation, it is not out of hand to believe that these people(souls) have chosen these circumstances because they desired the growth they could provide. If only the body dies and something eternal remains, living a life of hardship may give that entity the experience they are after in their journey.</p>
<p>I believe that randomness(as well as &#8220;coincidence&#8221;) does not exist as well and I believe that every experience we have is because on some level we choose, or at least allow, it to happen. The reasons for this are as myriad and unique as each individual, and just like each individual, no two are the same. Yet constantly we choose to experience things with, through and because of others&#8230; I believe this is because when we have the ability to create reality and experience to our choosing (&#8221;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;) and we connect with others that will facilitate our choices as well as theirs.</p>
<p>Why are you in a bad situation at the moment? Probably because you requested that obstacle so that you could gain the experience from having and overcoming it. If you are unwilling to accept what you have asked for and hold up your end of the bargain with reality, then why did you ask for it? People wonder why the same things happen over and over to them. Because they asked for it! Only when they realize this and step up to the plate and fufill the experience they chose will they move on to the next. Reality will give you exactly what you ask for, and if you ignore it, it&#8217;ll just try harder.</p>
<p>So, do you choose to win the lottery? Or do you want to win the lottery? Remember, saying you choose something and choosing it are two very different things. You must believe in your choice and know that it has happened even before you choose it. Faith of a mustard seed and all <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Damnit I wish there was an edit button! Sorry. </p>
<p>War1025-</p>
<p>So, you believe that someone other then yourself determines what you do and do not deserve? Do you believe some judgmental god in the sky determines this? I personally don&#8217;t buy it. It sounds like this belief is based on biblical myth that simply cannot be falsified. Why hold yourself back with the uncertainty that you are not enough? &#8220;You are enough&#8221;, is an empowering belief which is far more practical even if you do not believe that it is strictly true. </p>
<p>&#8220;Also, if everyone is 100% what they could be, then everyone is on the same level&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;level&#8221; there is no bar but your OWN happiness, comparing  people or comparing yourself to people is very self-limiting. Like you said War1025 people have different interests, to some having riches is something they enjoy but to other minimalism is far more enjoyable. You decide! Not god and not society.</p>

			<p>If you believe this shit, then why haven&#8217;t you changed the world yet? Why isn&#8217;t everything as you had hoped? The will of men falters. Things slip from his grasp. You may deserve the world, but you will not attain it. If you do, best wishes. There is only so much of it to go around. Life is inherently neutral. You can&#8217;t have everything.</p>

			<p>I like the first two conclusions peebs, Thank you for adding even more ridiculousness to the coincidence I had about 5 minutes ago <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>Every time i really get into the nitty-gritty of this whole concept, i always come across this idea and i guess id better share it.</p>
<p>Agreeing that randomness dose not exist, maybe the key to achieving any goal is to realize the right place to make the right decision. For instance, with no randomness, and no qualms with deserving some glory, all ya need is to follow the gameplan. Its like a maze, if you know where the end is, you can make some good moves and hopefully reach your goal. Maybe just a simple act of pausing 3 extra seconds on a street corner because it feels right is all it takes; to me, it seems that focusing on the right path to take is important. </p>
<p>Good luck,</p>

<p>I like this. There is a lot to be said about following the right/best path and using your intuition. If you believe the best for you will come to you if you let it, as well as follow it, is something I&#8217;m also on board with.</p>
<p>There may be a middle ground in there between man &#8220;controlling his fate&#8221; and &#8220;God&#8217;s Will&#8221; and other like-thoughts that might bridge the differences between even the disparate views presented here.</p>
<p>In 9th grade when the question of evolution vs. creationism was brought up to my biology teacher she said something I will never forget. She said that maybe they are just two different versions of the same story. To this day I still find a lot of wisdom in that.</p>

			<p>This idea first reminded me of an ancient philosophy that states that neither good nor evil could exist without the other, because the moment we decide what constitute &#8220;good&#8221;, we have simultaneously created the benchmark for &#8220;evil&#8221;. Similarly, by defining beauty we would set the benchmark for what is not beauty, which in a simplistic and dualistic viewpoint would equates ugly.</p>
<p>Meaning that despite ourselves achieving our maximum potential, we would nevertheless not be equal. Unless our maximum potential are all similar, there would still be the richer, the poorer, the ones that are more attractive, or smarter, or simply taller than the next person. Standards are created by ourselves, and as we change, it too adjust itself to fit our circumstances. </p>
<p>Though since we are not made equal, our idea of happiness will be different from one another. Each one of us having a different dream and a different role we wish to fit in society. We can agree on simple, superficial category such as attractiveness, intelligence, and even job description, just as we can all agree on the concept of fingerprint, which no two that are similar to the other have ever been found.</p>
<p>As Hey_you said, there are no &#8220;level&#8221; and there are no &#8220;bar&#8221;, just our own happiness. And in my case, our own preference.</p>
<p>So, I agree with you Sean. We all deserve to achieve our maximum potential.</p>
<p>And to war1025,</p>
<p>&#8220;To say man controls his fate, or that he knows what is best for himself… that is a leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not a huge leap to suggest that our beliefs, decision, and degree of confidence sway, if not dictate, our eventual fate (pun unintended). Even if you are forced into a corner, you are not without your options. You could always, for an example, bite your own tongue and kill yourself, which, regardless of whether it is &#8220;best&#8221; for yourself or not, is something you decided and it did affect your eventual outcome, thus your fate.</p>
<p>Unless you remove the equation of free-will, which would make many of our points moot.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you believe this shit, then why haven’t you changed the world yet? Why isn’t everything as you had hoped?&#8221;</p>
<p>If something is unobservable, it does not immediately indicate that it is untrue. A man of God like yourself should understand that best. It is not a far-stretch to suggest that if the world is indeed changing, we might not be able to readily observe it.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO FATE. THERE IS NO DESTINY. THERE IS ONLY FREEWILL. If you want something you can get it! How? By trusting in your abilities and doing something with them. Haven&#8217;t you ever heard the quote: &#8220;Shoot for the moon, if you miss you will land amongst the stars&#8221;. Same principle. You can expand your limits, you can achieve fulfillment and true happiness you just need to make that fulfillment your highest goal and act on it with the abilities you have and are developing. There is no man in the sky standing in your way or some kind of cosmic moral law, just you and your freewill. </p>
<p>The only person who can decide what is right for them is you not some over-reaching father figure watching us from the pearly gates. If your happiness is your ultimate goal then you will not manipulate or hurt others because that does not truly bring a person happiness. I cannot change the world but I can change myself and if everyone did the same then the world would (and will) be as we all hope.</p>

			<p>along the same lines, if there is free will, then there must be a god. because without a god or something *more* to life and existence, then we are nothing more than chemical / physical reactions. And as everyone knows, there is nothing random about science.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing lately that things are more random than they are predetermined. I know, that sounds odd. But random/fixed are not mutually exclusive ideas. Discoveries in the field of quantum physics suggest the possibility that life around us is not strictly cause-effect, but rather all effects have a possibility of occuring. The idea of cause-effect is mainly due to a) because we like to generalize, b) because events seem to be affected by each other, c) because it&#8217;s just easier to live like this.</p>
<p>Randomness/connectedness are therefore not mutually exclusive, because all the different effects a cause might have, are possible. It&#8217;s just that some of them have slightly higher chance of joining the current stream of reality.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not really fate-OR-free-will either.. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> It&#8217;s more like 75% Fate/ 25% Will for some, 50%/50% for others and 25%/75% for the lucky ones.<br />
_____</p>
<p>Hope that diversifies the opinion scene a bit.. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p>I never said I was an atheist. I just don&#8217;t buy organized religion. I am a deist. Also, I definitely don&#8217;t believe consciousness is just brain chemicals. I wouldn&#8217;t be posting here if I did. </p>
<p>Luminarious-</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how there can be fate (a fixed event) and freewill at the same time. I believe you choose what you experience and you are not a prisoner to your environment and so there is no random either. Peebrain has said something similar but I&#8217;ve held this idea before posting here.</p>

			<p>It is not difficult to believe that it is possible for both fate and freewill to co-exist.</p>
<p>We are bound by a set limit of physical and immaterial rules in our lives, like law of physics which means you won&#8217;t float into the sky like a helium balloon all of a sudden for no reason. With these set rules, we are subjected to an immense but ultimately limited amount of possible outcome. Imagine if each choice has an eventual outcome, subjected to change and diversion based on your decision which is affected by your individual freewill, you could say that fate exist in the massive but limited scope of possible eventuality.</p>
<p>You still get to choose your route, but what can happen is inherently limited by laws surrounding our existence.</p>

			<p>I know there are physical laws I&#8217;m arguing that you choose to experience within those laws, hence freewill.</p>
