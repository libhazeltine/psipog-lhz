		<description>Just to clarify (cause I just read what I typed and realized how much I sound like a member of the Illuminati) I define enslavement as conformity to another ideal that is not internally created by choice of the conformer.  If you define enslavement as conformity to another ideal without choice then I do feel that is wrong.  However if the conformity is by choice then I guess it's technically freedom.

I need to think about things more before I type them.</description>

		<description>I personally think some people need security to get through life, and some people can't live without freedom.  If everyone is free then we may not develop collectively as a human race, and if everyone is enslaved then there is no diversity to cause change and we still don't develop.  So what I'm trying to say is that for humanity progress I think there needs to be a balance between the two.  A good analogy is that without a conductor and a song writer, the orchestra can't play (at least not well) and without an orchestra, the conductor can't get much done.</description>

		<description>First off, most people say they want freedom, but what they actually want is security. I don't know if that pertains to this discussion at all, but it's the truth. Freedom is the ability to do whatever your heart desires. But it also means anyone else should be able to do whatever they desire. Some people have bad desires. Under freedom, they should be free to express such desires. However, most people want security, which means people are only permitted to be free in certain ways, effectively limiting their freedom. 

Maybe by listening to other people you lose your ability to be free. Which is true, but freedom is not always a good thing. Other people think of things you would not have otherwise conceived. I think we kind of talked about this in a previous post. They can tell you how, but they can't show you the way. Maybe they can show you the way, but they can't take the step for you. Either way, maybe freedom is choosing which steps to take. And maybe that is influenced by other people's input. But as someone, I think Isaac Newton, once said, "If I am great, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants." We are the products of previous experience. What we have is because of what came before us. If we are to block out all other input, we must forfeit everything we take for granted in life. To be free we must be completely primordial. Maybe we can't even be that, because technically instinct is honed by previous generations. 

There is no freedom, only the illusion of freedom.</description>

		<description>Like George Orwell said: "Freedom is slavery, slavery is freedom". 

But hey, that's if you're looking at it from a perspective of free will. If free will exists, then your version is right. If it doesn't - well, then I guess I'm writing this post in vain anyways. 

But why wouldn't free will exist??? Our whole society is BASED on free will. Without free will, things would be a lot quieter on the planet (and more boring, for that matter). The only way to achieve this "freedom" would be to predetermine everything, which is slavery by modern standards. Not an option for most people. So freedom be it, but it's that freedom that kills people's freedom, because they use that freedom to restrict themselves. Maybe it's because restriction is neccessary in either way?</description>

		<description>Teaching isn't enslavement, it's part of the path of personal development for the student AND the teacher.  It's like a freedom co-op :P  Everyone knows what they know partially because of someone else.  Some spark of knowledge, some seed of clarity and wisdom was put in that person's mind that made everything snap together for them, and this has happened many times for each person.  Teaching isn't everything, knowledge is just the basis for further growth if used that way, but it's a good start.  By teaching each other, we give others a potential head start at growth, whether they decide to take it or not.

Frankly, when written out like that, I can't see anything LESS related to enslavement than teaching.</description>

		<description>Wow. Another article that makes me think all weirdly.

Again I say this, Sean Conelly, you really should write a book.</description>
