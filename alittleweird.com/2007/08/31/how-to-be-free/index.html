				<p>Personal liberation is great.</p>
<p>But I get stuck.  See, it turns out that everyone is already free.  So if I sit here and say that I can help free you, then I&#8217;m lying.  You <em>are</em> free.</p>
<p>But I see a lot of people using their freedom to enslave themselves.  Then they cry because they are enslaved.  What am I suppose to do?  Help them to stop crying?  The only way to stop them from crying is to get them to realize they are already free.  But to get them to realize they are already free, they must free themselves from their own enslavement.  So I have to tell them that they aren&#8217;t free.  But they are.</p>
<p>If I tell you, &#8220;The only way to become free is to strive for truth in all things&#8221;, then that is nice.  It&#8217;s a nice little statement, which is very useful.  But it&#8217;s a lie.  And very hypocritical at that&#8230; I&#8217;m lying about striving for truth!</p>
<p>But if I tell you, &#8220;You are already free&#8221;, it is true.  But it&#8217;s not useful to you.  You are suffering, you feel enslaved, and you want to be free.  What good is it to know that you are already free?  If anything, that makes it worse!</p>
<p>So I must do the compassionate thing&#8230; I must lie in order to help out.  Everyone is free, but a lot of us don&#8217;t realize it.</p>
<p>So how do you free yourself?  Fuck if I know :-).</p>
<p>Personal liberation is one of those things you gotta do for yourself.  There&#8217;s a lot of bullshit out there&#8230; including this post :-).  Some idiot thinks he has things figured out, and wants to share his distorted perspective with the world.  That&#8217;s life.   Every person you see is expressing their personalized slavery.  So join them if you want&#8230; though I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it :-P.</p>
<p>People who make sense only make sense because they reflect the things that make sense in our own head.  Someone doesn&#8217;t help us or hurt us&#8230; we help and hurt ourself.  The person is only a reflection of this self-process.</p>
<p>So how do you free yourself anyway?  I suppose the best way would be to stop taking shit so seriously.  And don&#8217;t take that advice too seriously either :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one big contradiction.  If I tell you how to free yourself, then how can you be free of my instruction?  Teaching is enslavement.  If I give advice, then are you free to not take my advice?  Or do you feel compelled to take my advice?  If you don&#8217;t take my advice, you are enslaved, and if you take my advice, you are enslaved.  Good luck! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> (don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s a third path :-P).</p>
<p>Avoid people who know what they&#8217;re talking about.  They ruin truth.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m guilty of it&#8230; sorry :-P.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I get stuck. See, it turns out that everyone is already free. So if I sit here and say that I can help free you, then I’m lying. You are free.</p>
<p>But I see a lot of people using their freedom to enslave themselves. Then they cry because they are enslaved.&#8221; &#8212; <b>AMEN!</b></p>
<p>&#8220;What am I suppose to do? Help them to stop crying? The only way to stop them from crying is to get them to realize they are already free. But to get them to realize they are already free, they must free themselves from their own enslavement. So I have to tell them that they aren’t free. But they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>you dont have to tell them they arent free, you hit the nail on the head in the sentence prior.</p>
<p>your only job is to be you and share your knowledge and experience with those that wish to (or happen to) listen. you answer their questions as best you can if they have them and you simply explain YOUR understandings and experiences, as youve come to know have them. they will either resonate and take from that what works for them, or they wont (just as you have done in your life so far).</p>
<p>if this allows them to come to a place in which they can realize their true nature/purpose/place/ability/whatever, then you have done them the highest good you can&#8230; you have treated them as you would like to be treated. ultimately no one can MAKE another do anything, all will only come about by self choice. so it does not make you a hypocrite to share your experience with another at all. hoping that such sharing will lead to a certain outcome is naive, because how are we to know what the purpose of the encounter is. but knowing that you are being honest and true to yourself and that they are there to share it is enough to know it has a purpose&#8230; and if that purpose is to assist in their &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; and open their eyes to the &#8220;truth&#8221; of their personal enslavement, well then all the better.</p>
<p>this is resounding what was said a few posts back. you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink. you do not have to tell someone how to live or what to do or what truth is. but i would very much encourage that you share YOUR experience and YOUR truth and YOUR understanding, because i believe that these things are very important and can play an integral role in spurring on others&#8217; awareness.</p>

			<p>Let us enslave ourselves and use our harnessed resources to improve our lives.</p>
<p>As you know<br />
A saddled horse in fenced field is a valuable asset.<br />
A saddled horse without fenced field is a transport.<br />
A horse without field or saddle is a burden.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;liberating&#8221; ourselves, let us choose the slavemaster. Tobacco, alcohol, gaming, these are the bad masters. Why not select the ones who give us something concrete in return?<br />
Studying, working, self-development.. etc.</p>
<p>Hope it didn&#8217;t come across as too preachy.</p>

			<p>Teaching isn&#8217;t enslavement, it&#8217;s part of the path of personal development for the student AND the teacher.  It&#8217;s like a freedom co-op <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />  Everyone knows what they know partially because of someone else.  Some spark of knowledge, some seed of clarity and wisdom was put in that person&#8217;s mind that made everything snap together for them, and this has happened many times for each person.  Teaching isn&#8217;t everything, knowledge is just the basis for further growth if used that way, but it&#8217;s a good start.  By teaching each other, we give others a potential head start at growth, whether they decide to take it or not.</p>
<p>Frankly, when written out like that, I can&#8217;t see anything LESS related to enslavement than teaching.</p>

			<p>Like George Orwell said: &#8220;Freedom is slavery, slavery is freedom&#8221;. </p>
<p>But hey, that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re looking at it from a perspective of free will. If free will exists, then your version is right. If it doesn&#8217;t - well, then I guess I&#8217;m writing this post in vain anyways. </p>
<p>But why wouldn&#8217;t free will exist??? Our whole society is BASED on free will. Without free will, things would be a lot quieter on the planet (and more boring, for that matter). The only way to achieve this &#8220;freedom&#8221; would be to predetermine everything, which is slavery by modern standards. Not an option for most people. So freedom be it, but it&#8217;s that freedom that kills people&#8217;s freedom, because they use that freedom to restrict themselves. Maybe it&#8217;s because restriction is neccessary in either way?</p>

			<p>First off, most people say they want freedom, but what they actually want is security. I don&#8217;t know if that pertains to this discussion at all, but it&#8217;s the truth. Freedom is the ability to do whatever your heart desires. But it also means anyone else should be able to do whatever they desire. Some people have bad desires. Under freedom, they should be free to express such desires. However, most people want security, which means people are only permitted to be free in certain ways, effectively limiting their freedom. </p>
<p>Maybe by listening to other people you lose your ability to be free. Which is true, but freedom is not always a good thing. Other people think of things you would not have otherwise conceived. I think we kind of talked about this in a previous post. They can tell you how, but they can&#8217;t show you the way. Maybe they can show you the way, but they can&#8217;t take the step for you. Either way, maybe freedom is choosing which steps to take. And maybe that is influenced by other people&#8217;s input. But as someone, I think Isaac Newton, once said, &#8220;If I am great, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.&#8221; We are the products of previous experience. What we have is because of what came before us. If we are to block out all other input, we must forfeit everything we take for granted in life. To be free we must be completely primordial. Maybe we can&#8217;t even be that, because technically instinct is honed by previous generations. </p>
<p>There is no freedom, only the illusion of freedom.</p>

			<p>I personally think some people need security to get through life, and some people can&#8217;t live without freedom.  If everyone is free then we may not develop collectively as a human race, and if everyone is enslaved then there is no diversity to cause change and we still don&#8217;t develop.  So what I&#8217;m trying to say is that for humanity progress I think there needs to be a balance between the two.  A good analogy is that without a conductor and a song writer, the orchestra can&#8217;t play (at least not well) and without an orchestra, the conductor can&#8217;t get much done.</p>

			<p>Just to clarify (cause I just read what I typed and realized how much I sound like a member of the Illuminati) I define enslavement as conformity to another ideal that is not internally created by choice of the conformer.  If you define enslavement as conformity to another ideal without choice then I do feel that is wrong.  However if the conformity is by choice then I guess it&#8217;s technically freedom.</p>
<p>I need to think about things more before I type them.</p>
