		<description>Another book worth looking at:  Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon...Something haha.  Did a huge study over decades about how people became successful for a Carnegie Mellon professor I believe.  The deal was he'd do the research, publish the book, and then his payment would be the knowledge and understanding he gained.  (I think the guy's a millionaire now not coincidentally heh.  He did his study by interviewing the most successful people in the world and it talks about abundance mindset somewhat too I believe.  It's less about tricks in real estate and tax forms and more about a general mindset of wealth btw.  A very interesting read.</description>

		<description>Hey Sean,

maybe this could be also interesting to you: Esther Hicks, A New Beginning, or Sanaya Roman, Creating Money. Same idea, but without religious fundament.

		<description>Not only that but riches and comfort is very relative.  What might please one person may not mean anything to another.</description>

		<description>And so it begiiiiinnsssss!  Hey Sean, nice site.  I'm really digging WP.  Make sure you get the sitemaps and SE Management plugins for it.

Thinking yourself rich is a nice idea, along with intention manifestation, but at the end of the day the real measure of the likelihood of success is how willing a person is to tirelessly work for and make sacrifices for it.

Good to see you writing again ;)

		<description>I find that if you want to become rich you get lucky or meet a lot of people and work hard with what you got. It's mostly about creativity and seeing what others don't. 

Maybe I don't get this idea of natural state of abundance...</description>
