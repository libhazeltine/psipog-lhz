		<description>It's interesting how you put it. I know your co-worker must have been well intended but once we find somethin that works, our mind sticks to it. It's hard to break away from the 'mental sets' we've created through our experiences in life and it's a double whammy when you don't even notice the system in which you think about things and come to conclusions.

We're the ones who see the thoughts though. *thumbs up*</description>

		<description>well, reading this I asked myself.... what makes me know what I need... I got a goofy answer but it was something to the effect of.

"you never know, life is always changing, but our ingrained thoughts are like peanuts... You love them, but that guy up there could die just eating one.  You cannot always say what you need, or what he needs"

Kinda fuzzy but it truly makes me think "wow... I love peanuts, but they'd kill him" so who knows what we all need</description>

		<description>"If you see your own thoughts, who are you?  Are you your thoughts?  Or are you the one whose seeing the thoughts?"

Wouldn't your thoughts be the production of your mind, which is "you?"  To me this is almost like asking:   "If I draw a picture and then look at it, am I the picture? or am I the one whose seeing the picture?"

Philosophically, you could say at some level the picture is a part of you, or at the least a representation of you.  But really, I'm pretty sure your the one looking at the picture.  Same with your thoughts.</description>

		<description>"Just a few days ago, my subconscious said, “You can only understand what you are.” It seemed random at the time, but it makes sense."

Just a few days ago, I said to my subconscious, "We need more money." And he said "Amen to that."</description>

		<description>actually i heard that 2 people died before the rampage started, a man and a woman, isn't it possible that the woman was his girlfriend? and possibly with another man? he would kill them, and then figure.. well.. im already going to hell, might as well kill everyone else who gave me dirty looks since i got here.

heh... might as well guess while i still can...
i apologize for this comment in advance</description>
