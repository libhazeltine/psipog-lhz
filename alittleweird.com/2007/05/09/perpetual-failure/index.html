			<div class="entry">
				<p>I have a friend who is Wiccan.  Her mother is Wiccan, and psychic abilities run in her family.  Every once in a while, I&#8217;ll go over to her house, and we might play with this thing called &#8220;<a href="http://www.museumoftalkingboards.com/circle.html" title="Psychic Circle Picture">Psychic Circle</a>&#8221; - basically, it&#8217;s a board like the Ouija board, but more stuff on it.</p>
<p>If you know me, then you know I&#8217;m don&#8217;t believe in these ritualistic silly games.  Nonetheless, I do believe it could be used to &#8220;channel&#8221; the subconscious mind - which <em>could</em> realistically produce psychic answers.  So it has potential, even though it seems a little strange at first.  (Of course, I could be wrong!  This is just how I reason it to myself.)</p>
<p>When you play &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221;, you need four people.  We all put our hands on the little plastic disk, ask &#8220;the spirits&#8221; something, and wait for the disk to hover over an answer.</p>
<p>When we do this, it&#8217;s clear that my friend (the one mentioned earlier) is the person moving the disk.  So she is either moving it consciously, subconsciously, or maybe a mixture between the two.</p>
<p>Now - the problem is that the answers we get are completely silly and worthless.  However, I want you to imagine this situation.  Four of us sitting down, with the lights off and candles lit, incense, and asking &#8220;the spirits&#8221; random questions.  My friend delivers the answers - but probably isn&#8217;t aware of her own hand movements.  We get responses that don&#8217;t make sense.  Now myself, and the other two participants, look at the answers and say things like, &#8220;Hmm, that doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;What the hell?&#8221;  Or, &#8220;Ooooooook.&#8221;</p>
<p>My friend, on the other hand, defends the cryptic responses and tries to make them work.  <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>You might think this entire story is stupid, but the essence of where the failure occurs is very important - and applies to anyone practicing psychic abilities.</p>
<p>My friend has a vested interest in the results of &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221; to be correct.  What does it mean to her if the cryptic responses are worthless?  Look at her belief system.</p>
<p>She is Wiccan.  Her mother is Wiccan.  Her mother taught her a lot about psychic abilities at a young age, from the perspective of rituals, spirits, s√©ances, channeling, threefold law, etc.  This is her religion.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221; fails, then look at what&#8217;s at stake.  It could force her to question her mother, her beliefs she&#8217;s held her entire life, past psychic experiences, past rituals, etc.  Socially, she would have to face myself and the other participants, and consider that she&#8217;s letting us down.  Letting her mother down, perhaps?  She has put so much energy into this belief system - and she has a lot of energy dedicated to &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221; being correct.</p>
<p>Now - I&#8217;m not saying the Wiccan religion is responsible for this.  What I&#8217;m saying is that my friends specific situation really puts a lot of pressure on her.</p>
<p>And now the kicker - think of what happens when we start a new &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221; session.  Subconsciously, she knows she&#8217;s the one moving the disk, and she knows she&#8217;s the one responsible for the answers.  She knows she&#8217;s generated answers in the past which didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.  Now she has to &#8220;perform&#8221; in front of three of her friends, and hope for the best - or her entire belief system is at stake.</p>
<p>Is she in a good state of mind to be receiving psychic answers?  Is she in a relaxed carefree mood?  Maybe consciously - but subconsciously?  Far from it.  So - because of all these fears, she&#8217;s put into a bad state of mind, and she can&#8217;t receive accurate psychic information.  Because she can&#8217;t receive accurate psychic information, she feels her belief system is under attack.  Because she&#8217;s put so much energy into her belief system, she decides (probably subconsciously) that it&#8217;s better to distort and force the cryptic responses to mean something, rather than admit they&#8217;re probably bogus.  Because of this, the other three participants (including myself) grow more cynical.  Because we grow more cynical, the next time we do &#8220;Psychic Circle&#8221; we&#8217;ll put even more emphasis on correct answers.  Because of the increased pressure, she is in a worse state of mind the next time - and she can&#8217;t accurately receive psychic information.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>As you can see, this produces a downward spiral of increasing pressure on her.  Which is bad news.</p>
<p>You might argue that this situation is unique to my friend.  In reality, this sort of perpetual failure can happen to anyone.  All it needs is a belief system that produces poor results, that we have a vested interest in maintaining.  And we know that those aren&#8217;t short on demand :-P.</p>
<p>If you think something like this is happening to yourself, it&#8217;s important to answer the following question: what do I fear?  What is the worst case scenario?  For my friend, she might fear that she&#8217;s letting her mother down.  Or she might fear that her mother is wrong.  Or she might fear that her friends will call her names :-P.  It&#8217;s important to deal with this root fear.</p>
<p>For my friend, let&#8217;s assume that she fears that her mother is wrong about Wicca, and she fears that the religion itself is incorrect.  What is the solution?</p>
<p>Well, one solution is to change religions.  However, let&#8217;s not go to that extreme just yet :-P.  There are better solutions.</p>
<p>A positive solution would be to study the Wiccan religion more.  Get some books - and not those &#8220;Teen Wiccan&#8221; ones <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> - actual legitimate books on the Wiccan religion.  Learn more details about it, and refocus on understanding the different perspectives inside the religion itself.  Educate yourself.  Become an expert on the religion.</p>
<p>Why does this solve the problem?  It removes the link between her mother and Wicca.  Right now, when she thinks of Wicca, she thinks of her mother teaching it to her.  If my friend later decides she doesn&#8217;t want to be Wiccan, then she feels she would be insulting her mother - i.e., rejecting Wicca is rejecting her mother.  However - if she educates herself on Wicca - then she can separate the religion from her mother.  She is free to reject the religion without insulting her mother.  Wicca is Wicca.  Her mother is her mother.</p>
<p>However, if she studies more, there is another path as well.  Perhaps she really falls in love with the religion.  Perhaps she reads somewhere about channeling spirits incorrectly, and learns new techniques to try.  This will give her a confidence boost, and free herself from all the pressure.  If she&#8217;s trying a new technique, and fails to get good results, then she can blame the technique (or her inexperience with the technique).  Not the religion.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you feel yourself slipping into perpetual failure, then ask yourself: what do I fear?  Then address that fear in a positive way.  Create an intelligent plan to remove the fear.  Sure, it takes effort - no one said growing as a person is always easy - but it will relieve the pressure and feel good :-P.  And when you finish this process, and look back in hindsight, you&#8217;ll notice that the worst case scenario you had imagined in your head never happened.</p>

			<p>I had the same problem your friend had when I was doing telepathy for some guys I met at school. Unfortunatly they were the type that, if you didn&#8217;t get 100% all the time then it doesn&#8217;t exist. My average was around 90 - 95% But it was probably all the pressure and me getting nervous that it didn&#8217;t work. I knew that the only reason my success rate was so low was because I was nervous. This is probably the same thing that happens to psions who try to perform in front of audiences (2 or more people).</p>
<p>As for the psychic circle game. Me and my bros bought a ouji board when I was like 16 and they were like 12. The lady that rang us up told my parents that the game was demonic (that really pissed me off). But when I got home to play it everything was pretty cool. I had already spoken to my sub-c many times. And when I asked the board who was talking it said &#8220;me&#8221;. So yeah, those things are really cool. Unfortunatly because the comment that the cashier made at the Toy&#8217;sR&#8217;Us store, my parents tossed the game the next day. (That was a well wasted 20$)</p>
