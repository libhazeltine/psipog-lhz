		<description>I had the same problem your friend had when I was doing telepathy for some guys I met at school. Unfortunatly they were the type that, if you didn't get 100% all the time then it doesn't exist. My average was around 90 - 95% But it was probably all the pressure and me getting nervous that it didn't work. I knew that the only reason my success rate was so low was because I was nervous. This is probably the same thing that happens to psions who try to perform in front of audiences (2 or more people).

As for the psychic circle game. Me and my bros bought a ouji board when I was like 16 and they were like 12. The lady that rang us up told my parents that the game was demonic (that really pissed me off). But when I got home to play it everything was pretty cool. I had already spoken to my sub-c many times. And when I asked the board who was talking it said "me". So yeah, those things are really cool. Unfortunatly because the comment that the cashier made at the Toy'sR'Us store, my parents tossed the game the next day. (That was a well wasted 20$)</description>
