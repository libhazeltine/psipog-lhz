			<div class="entry">
				<p>I like to think of beliefs as living organisms inside my head.  They aren&#8217;t ME&#8230; they are external to ME&#8230; but I choose to buy into some of them, for one reason or another. My beliefs aren&#8217;t me is because I can change my beliefs drastically, yet I still exist, right here, same old me :-).</p>
<p>I also like to think of beliefs as fighting inside of my head.  Beliefs that contradict each other battle it out in the desolate landscape of my brain :-P.  Beliefs that agree with each other team up.  When one belief-team beats another belief-team, it represents a shift in my personal beliefs - it means I no longer believe in the dead team, and I put more energy in believing the winning team.</p>
<p>Maybe the analogy is a little silly, but it&#8217;ll help to use it when understanding how beliefs become ingrained in our minds.</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; process in our minds.  The &#8220;strongest&#8221; will survive.  And there is an evolution in beliefs as well.  Over time, beliefs evolve towards stronger ideas.  If they don&#8217;t evolve, they usually die off.</p>
<p>Now to the point: A lot of times, the things we believe in are only believed in because that belief has navigated our mental landscape effectively.  Not because it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example to clear all this up.  Let&#8217;s examine the belief, &#8220;Psychic abilities don&#8217;t exist.&#8221; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   This one I have a lot of experience with.</p>
<p>At some point, the idea of psychic abilities enters your head.  It&#8217;s then divided into two beliefs - one, it exists, and two, it doesn&#8217;t exist.  Each side starts building an army.  Psychic abilities exist because&#8230; maybe&#8230; &#8220;My mom says they do, and my mom is smart.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;The world is a magical place.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes.&#8221;  Or, the classic, &#8220;They just do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Psychic abilities don&#8217;t exist because&#8230; maybe&#8230; &#8220;Science says they don&#8217;t.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;It&#8217;s silly.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen it.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t announced on the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the two beliefs battle it out.</p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;My mom says psychic abilities exist&#8230; my mom wouldn&#8217;t lie, and she&#8217;s smart.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;Yes, but, that doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t be wrong.  She&#8217;s human, maybe she&#8217;s made some mistakes.  Besides, science says psychic abilities don&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;What does science know anyway?  Who cares what science says.  If my mom could be wrong, then you have to admit science could be wrong as well.  If you think that psychic abilities don&#8217;t exist, then you are taking the magic out of the world.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;Science has a better track record than your mom.  How &#8216;magical&#8217; the world is really doesn&#8217;t play a factor into what&#8217;s true or false.  The world can still be a beautiful and amazing place without psychic abilities.  It&#8217;s just silly to believe in them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;Why is it silly?  That doesn&#8217;t make sense.  Besides, you can argue about this stuff all you want, but you have to remember that time when my mom knew Sally was pregnant before Sally told anyone.  If psychic abilities aren&#8217;t real, then how did mom do that?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;There could be a million explanations.  Listen, just because I can&#8217;t explain every little thing in the universe doesn&#8217;t mean that psychic abilities exist.  Maybe your mom just guessed and got lucky - who knows.  Or maybe Sally told your mom, but your mom didn&#8217;t tell you.  Maybe you&#8217;re just remembering the whole situation backwards.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now we hit one interesting point.  Both the 1 and 2 beliefs are debating about a memory.  What if a belief could rewrite memories?  Then that belief would be pretty strong.  A belief that could rewrite memories is more powerful than a belief that couldn&#8217;t - so, it&#8217;s natural for beliefs to evolve towards editing your memory.  Those that don&#8217;t edit your memory will die off.  Those that do edit your memory can literally <em>create</em> evidence in it&#8217;s favor.  Let&#8217;s suppose the #2 belief discovers how to edit memories :-).</p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;In fact, if you remember specifically what happened, your mom received a phone call right before she told you that Sally was pregnant.  I bet either someone told her, or someone hinted it to her over the phone.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;Hmmm.  I do remember that.  I don&#8217;t think the phone call was related though.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;Yes, it was related.  She told you right after she got off the phone.  I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t think of this before!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And now our #1 belief is about to die off&#8230; unless it also evolves.  So our clever #1 belief decides to get some help from surrounding beliefs - specifically, the belief that &#8220;My mother is honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;Wait a second.  If you&#8217;re telling me that my mother purposely lied to me, then that simply isn&#8217;t true.  My mother is an honorable person who would never deceive me.  She doesn&#8217;t lie.  If what you&#8217;re saying is true, then you also have to admit that my mother is a liar.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <em>&#8220;Well, your mother did lie.  You have to face the facts.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>1. <em>&#8220;Absolutely not.  The only fact here is that my mother is honest, and that if I don&#8217;t believe in psychic abilities, then I&#8217;m calling my mother a liar.  Since she isn&#8217;t a liar, then I must believe in psychic abilities.  Simple as that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>2. <strong>*Croak*</strong></p>
<p>Alrighty!  So our #1 belief lived to see another day (for all the wrong reasons!).</p>
<p>These mental tricks are performed all the time.  A belief will grow stronger and stronger, using tricks like altering your memory, aligning itself to other beliefs, name calling, social conditioning, altering your perception, &#8220;selective hearing&#8221;, becoming emotional, using pride and the ego, etc.  All these strategies are effective.</p>
<p>One way to stop these dirty tricks from occurring in your mind is to sit and listen to two beliefs battle it out.  A lot of times these battles will take place subconsciously.  Sit and listen.  Make these battles conscious.  For example, when our #2 belief tried to alter our memory, we could consciously see this happening, and intervene.  Perhaps you keep a diary or journal.  Look at the entry from that day, and force your beliefs to play by the rules.  Whatever your journal entry is, then decide that it must be the way it happened.  Tada - no more memory alteration.  (Of course, this still encourages beliefs to alter your perception of experiences, which would in turn alter how you would record it in your journal.)</p>
<p>Another example - notice how the #1 belief makes the statement: &#8220;If I don&#8217;t believe in psychic abilities, then I&#8217;m calling my mother a liar.&#8221;  Our beliefs do this ALL THE TIME (another example, &#8220;If you&#8217;re a republican, you&#8217;re not a democrat.  I&#8217;m a democrat, and I&#8217;m smart.  Therefore, if you&#8217;re a republican, you aren&#8217;t smart, and therefore stupid.&#8221; - sound familiar?)  When I notice a belief trying to do something like that, I always interject: &#8220;Surely we can have it both ways.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be one way or the other.  You can not believe in psychic abilities, and your mother can still be honest.  You can be a republican, and still be smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over time, the strongest beliefs in your mind are probably in that position because they have the dirtiest tricks.  Not because they hold any truth.  An even bigger problem is when you believe in something that&#8217;s true, yet you believe in it for all the wrong reasons.  In those cases, the belief can attach a lot of negative baggage to something you have to admit is true.  You&#8217;ll feel obligated to also believe in the negative baggage as well, and it will feel like you MUST believe in all the baggage, even though you don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Watch for these dirty tricks.  Your beliefs will only use them if you allow them to use them.  Hold your beliefs accountable, and force each one to make an honest case for itself.  And if you ever notice a belief become too ingrained, let that fact set off an alarm in your head.  If a belief is really strong, chances are it got that way by doing something dirty.  This is why the &#8220;Beginner&#8217;s Mind&#8221; is treasured in Zen &#8212; in the beginner&#8217;s mind, there are no overpowering beliefs that dominate the mental landscape.</p>

			<p>Nice entry! I think my Dream Journal may have found yet another purpose ^_^<br />
I&#8217;ve tried a few times to &#8216;talk&#8217; to my subconscious with the old psipog articles, but never has it crossed my mind to listen to my subconscious talk to itself!</p>

			<p>Interesting successor to your &#8220;Communicating With Your Subconscious&#8221; article back in the day. Beliefs are a big part in Chaos Magick and in everyday life. I notice that you linked to Stevepavlina.com, is he one of your influences? He was one of mine.</p>

			<p>That is a very interesting analogy on how beliefs work. When I read that I automatically realized that I can relate to that and the &#8220;battle&#8221; happens quite often these days. Also the obligation to believe seems to play a key role in society today through media and other sources, as some people will believe anything that they hear on television or in a movie.</p>

			<p>Wow!  That is some inspiring blog.  I love the analogy and think that the little debate concept will be useful.</p>
