		<description>That is a very interesting analogy on how beliefs work. When I read that I automatically realized that I can relate to that and the "battle" happens quite often these days. Also the obligation to believe seems to play a key role in society today through media and other sources, as some people will believe anything that they hear on television or in a movie.</description>

		<description>Interesting successor to your "Communicating With Your Subconscious" article back in the day. Beliefs are a big part in Chaos Magick and in everyday life. I notice that you linked to Stevepavlina.com, is he one of your influences? He was one of mine.</description>

		<description>Nice entry! I think my Dream Journal may have found yet another purpose ^_^
I've tried a few times to 'talk' to my subconscious with the old psipog articles, but never has it crossed my mind to listen to my subconscious talk to itself!</description>
