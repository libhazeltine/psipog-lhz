		<description>Lol. This blog reminds me a lot of myself. I've had the same problem too!! What I've rationalized is there are many things I can do and may ways for me to bring positivity in the world, so I've decided to just stay as conscious and present as I can with everything I do. I figured that may help people through example rather than just instruction. 
Maybe it's the same case for you. I don't know I'm not you but I guess it's something to think about. 
Nice post!</description>

to leave my name for ages to come

Lol. Now that you posted here, I believe you've left your mark :P.

To Sircubes:
Hey, me too. I was looking through my emails and noticed an email from alittleweird from a while ago and decided to check this place out.

BTW, Sean, if you need help with programming, I can help you with html, javascript, and php. Happy coding!</description>

		<description>Ah man, I'm glad I came accross this site ^_^.  A while ago someone I used to talk to from Psipog gave me the link to here.  I favorited it and eventually forgot about it since it was empty at the time.  I was looking for something through my favorites yesterday, I thought that this might be it.  It wasn't, but it was along the same lines of what I was looking for ^_^.  I've read most of the articles already.  I doubt many people will recognize me from Psipog though, I wasn't really active in the posting on Psipog.  On to the article.

I suppose this is what I'm going through right now.  It made me really sad to go through and feel like there is no point to absolutely anything in the long run.  I completely lost my purpose once I realized there isn't a full purpose to have a purpose other than for it to be for yourself.  But after going through a bunch of things, I realized that it really wasn't worth going through life the way I was.  So, just gotta live to live, like a few others are saying.  I still can't seem to grasp what I'm trying to do though, I mean I understand, its just that my feelings aren't consistent with it, I get really unmotivated to do things, while others its really easy.  It takes time I suppose...</description>

		<description>Oh my god, I can't believe I'm reading this. You are exactly, EXACTLY, describing what I'm going trough now and have been going trough the past years. I quote this, I could've written it myself, it is exactly what I experience: "For me, it wasn’t useful at all. All it did was make me feel forced to move in one direction, when what I really felt was that I wanted to move in all directions at once."

The point I am at now is what your friend says, just relax and don't think about it, (try to) enjoy life. Altough this varies with me from time to time, sometimes even from hour to hour, I hope I will stabilize in that direction, although I still have a feeling inside I NEED a purpose. I will try for myself the experience reality thing, see how it works out ;)
This is really a great blog, keep it up! Also in your previous blog you write a lot of things I can relate to and find in my head every day. I think we have in some sense a very similar way of thinking, a similar way of using consciousness. Would it be a coincidence I program too :p?</description>

		<description>Uh uh, that's a bad idea.  Keep up the daily blogs, the site can wait a little bit.  Or pull overtime and either get it done fast or die trying :P</description>

		<description>I agree with Sean to some extent.  Personal experience and enjoyment is a good portion of purpose.  For me though, being a Christian that is not my entire purpose, there is also emphasis on the well being and more importantly, their soul.  For me though the thing I enjoy the most in life (besides my girlfriend =D) is music.  I'm a percussionist and I love listening, playing, and writing/composing music.  So that is the life that I'm going to pursue, I'm 15 and am taking a music major next year in school.</description>

		<description>I had the same problem as you did. In the end I turned to the "lore of old" and decided on something I read in Greek liturature. My only purpose is life is to do something great so as to leave my name for ages to come. That and to learn about what ever interests me the most!</description>

		<description>Nice post! I was the same as well, feeling depressed and such. I zoomed out of it after I noticed that not everyone really needs a purpose to continue their lives. A friend of mine told me that she just lives. so I'm on that track now ^_^</description>
