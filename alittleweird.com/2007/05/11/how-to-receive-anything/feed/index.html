		<description>That's similar to the technique I use.. except I use kind of a computer thing instead. This would probably work better, though, so I will try this later.

I imagine that my brain is just one huge computer, and that any thoughts or emotions will bring up the CPU usage. When I want to receive something, I make myself clear all the thoughts except the monitoring device that shows my usage. When I get as low as I can, I shut off the monitor, and start.</description>

		<description>If anyone's ever heard of accessing the Akashic Library, this is what it's talking about.  The Zen Buddhists call it Satori, and apparently scientists have named the state "flow" for the natural, flawless flow athletes have when in this state of consciousness.  In a previous post Sean mentioned this question: "If you're observing your thoughts, then you are not them.  So what are you then?"  You are just consciousness, that which we all have in common.  You could call it God, or your soul, but it's the observer of the mind's busy thoughts and it has great power because of it's universiality.  Thus the "God" label coming up, because this state puts you in touch with everything because on a basic level you ARE everything.

I like the visualization of thinking of more and more discrete levels of existence.  The least discrete element of your being is obviously your physical body.  The next is the bioelectric field you give off due to the reactions going on in your body which expands slightly outside your physical body.  The next is your aura which is even larger.  And so on and so on, until you've expanded to include everything on the most discrete level.  Your "pond" at this level is EVERYTHING, so when you look for certain "drops", nothing is outside your reach and you can figure out things that your grosser levels are not expansive enough to give an accurate answer about.

I tend to get too "new-agey" for some people, I know :)  But hey that's me.  Hope this sparks something for you guys.</description>

		<description>I'll try and keep the ripples down for a minuet or two. I think quiting my mind has always been pretty easy.</description>

		<description>Interesting way of think about it.  I already do this, but you did put into some interesting words.  Good one.</description>

		<description>This is what is sometimes called the Gnostic State. Pretty useful actually. :)</description>

		<description>This is the kind of article I've been waiting for :-)
I already use a variation of this technique (by listening for anything that doesn't sound like my own mental voice) but I've been looking for something new to try. Thanks!</description>

		<description>I do that. I'll try to not think of stuff until I get an answer. And if I think I made it up it usually seems like a thought rather than that, so I know its not it.</description>
