		<description>I never heard of psipog until it was already archived. It was late 2006. I read a lot of the articles and learned a lot of cool stuff. I just feel really uncomfortable going to old web sites(and old places)that are no longer ever visited. Maybe psipog is still visited, but how would I know? Anyway, I was bored and I thought "Maybe A little weird is open now" and so I came here, expecting to see just the homepage and nothings else. I was suprised to see all this already done.</description>

		<description>Well PB/Sean.

I meant to write this to you on your old blog:

Aw man:(.
You were and still are such a great guy and I think that everyone could agree on that.
I am still young and want to experiment more with everything. I guess you have matured and found your place. Maybe thats what happens to all of us sooner or later.
I believe you are amazing at all parapsychology. 
You have helped tons of people achieve the goal that you wanted to, I'd just wish you would stick around with psipog.
Well good luck! 

Don't let psipog go! :)

		<description>Nice post, Sean. Its great to see ALW up and running, and I plan on resuming my mod-ness if you ever need it.

I had just a few notes on what you posted today. I would have to agree with a quote Anniesocks gave just before she left when she was asked what she would say when she left PsiPog:

"It was a hell of a ride. Bye." After which she proceeded to say "now shut up and leave me alone". In any case, I had an awesome time at Pog. Though, I do have to disagree with you in some aspects.

I personally think the "downfall" of the community actually occurred during your "Golden Age". I personally thought that the amount of intelligent content actually dropped during this time. Sure, the forums were propagated with questions and conversation, but how much of it was actually really, really interesting? I felt that the "stupid noob" questions were actually proliferating at very fast rates. It was after you started the "fair rules" thing that I felt the community shift, even more so perhaps than after PsiSoldier.

The "oldies" left and every week a flock of new people came in, usually one just as stupid as the other. All the friends I had made over the years either grew up or got tired of the new feel of the community. I'm not saying you did a poor job, I'm just saying the bond that the community shared ended up being kaput. 

But despite the fact that I felt the community was lacking near the end, I really think PsiPog did its job. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. PsiPog taught me how to start and run my own website, and now PsiOnline is actually becoming a well known name. I actually owe you a very large thanks, Sean. You've helped me out a lot, and I'm not sure how I could pay you back.

I'll be visiting ALW, lets hope this place is just as great a sucess, and its community just as warm and welcoming as I saw PsiPog's in the "good old days".

		<description>wow I have to say that reference to goldeneye 007 made my day haha. Even though I was only at psipog for a year until it was archived I think that I learned a lot about psionics and also many life lessons as well. Psipog helped me to understand that the world is a much more mysterious place then people have lead on. It was also great to hear about the beginnings of psipog before I even found it.</description>

		<description>There were some rules that definitly bugged me, but you know what?  I'm glad you had that "If you don't like the way my site is run, make your own".  I made my own, swearing to someday make my site worth something and I did.  I guess I thought I could get close to competing, and while I still haven't, I've come a long way.  So, in a strange turn around way, I thank you.  Plus, I completely understand some of the mistakes you made.  I've made a few myself.</description>

		<description>Personally, I wasn't around for the whole "agree, shut up, or leave the site" attitude. By the time I had joined, it was closer to "if you disagree, you had better have a good reason. Otherwise shut up or leave."

It's nice to see you've got your new site running, though.</description>

		<description>Wow, I really didn't know psipog was that bad in the beginning. Well, psipog was fun, and alittle weird works perfect as an "after site". Once you read the articles and try just about everything there really isn't much to turn to.</description>
