		<description>oh Oh i have had that happen before.  It was before we bought our land and put the house on it.  We moved out of our big place and into a townhouse.  we were signing the leaves and had both decided it was going to take us a while to find what we wanted and were going to sign a year long lease.  When we sat at the table I suddenly felt like we should be signing a six month one.  My husband argued and still signed the 12 month lease.  We ended up moving out and into our new place in 6 months anyway.</description>

		<description>I get my sub-c telling me those things too. But I'm also a genius when it comes to connecting things that don't make any sense. In this case Memorial Day would have been the first thing that popped into my head if someone had told me strange hours like that.</description>

		<description>The movie "Waking Life" is a great film on lucid dreaming. I'd encourage anyone trying to have a lucid dream to watch it; it really gets your mind thinking ;)</description>

		<description>I tried WILDing this morning, and I ended up having a False Awakening and thinking "Shoot! I better close my eyes and go back to trying to sleep/WILD!"
I don't like how ironic my life can get...</description>
