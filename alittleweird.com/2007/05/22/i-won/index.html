				<p>Hahaha!</p>
<p>So I went to the store today.  For no real reason&#8230; mainly because I wanted to walk outside, and walking to the store gives me an excuse to enjoy the sunny weather.</p>
<p>By the time I made it to the store, I had to pee, so I went to the bathroom.  I came out, and figured it&#8217;s time to go home.  While walking out the store, a lottery machine caught my eye :-).  I had $60 on me, all in $20 bills.  I was going to purchase one ticket for the fun of it, until I noticed a sign saying that the machine doesn&#8217;t give any change.  So it was either buy a bunch of tickets for $20, or walk.</p>
<p>After deliberation, I decided to put in a $20.  I got 9 tickets, at different price ranges ($1, $1, $2, $2, $2, $3, $3, $3, $3).  I walked home with them in my hands, partly thinking I&#8217;m a complete fool, and partly thinking this is going to be totally sweet.</p>
<p>About half way home, I decided to send out the intention.  I made the decision to make a profit.  I didn&#8217;t want to go for the jackpot, because it was too unbelievable for me at that point.  But I could realistically intend on making a profit, and not feel guilty about lying to myself :-P.  I also visualized myself making this post online, announcing that my intention came true.</p>
<p>When I got home, I laid out all the tickets, and told each one that it was a winner.  I also told the tickets that the total of all the prizes would be more than $20.  Then I started scratching, from cheapest to most expensive.</p>
<p>The first ticket I scratched, I won $3.  So I was feeling really awesome :-).</p>
<p>The second ticket was a dud.  And so were the next 4 tickets.</p>
<p>The 7th ticket I won $10.  So my prizes totaled $13, with 2 tickets left.</p>
<p>My 8th ticket won $24.  And my 9th was a dud.</p>
<p>So: I spent $20 on scratch off tickets, intended to make a profit, and post my success online.</p>
<p>I scratched the tickets, won $37, and am posting this online.</p>
<p>I hate being right sometimes &gt;:-D.</p>

			<p>How strange. So you made the intention AFTER you had bought the tickets, yet you still won.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s freaky because it could imply that there&#8217;s no free will and everything is determined: the universe (or whatever) &#8220;knew&#8221; you were going to make that intention, so you got the winning tickets.</p>
<p>Or maybe this was the result of the past intentions you made before buying the tickets?</p>
<p>Or, the numbers on the tickets didn&#8217;t even exist until you scratched it, and then it came to exist.</p>
<p>I dunno. How confusing.</p>
<p>But still, that&#8217;s freaking awesome! Congratulations Sean.<br />

			<p>Re:bobelly</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite possible that the state of the tickets (winning/ not winning) is not fixed until they are scratched. A bit like the Schroedinger&#8217;s Cat thing..</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m glad to hear about your success, Sean. I&#8217;ve been slowly, but surely getting used to success myself.

			<p>Very nice PeeBrain.<br />
Im very happy that you won.</p>
<p>I was thinking of how randomness doesn&#8217;t exist. Heres a way that I thought of it:<br />
If someone says &#8220;I will roll this die and see what random number will come up&#8221; thats not really so true. Rolling it isn&#8217;t really random, It&#8217;s not a random number at all. The die simply just rolls/bounces on the table.</p>
<p>This might not make any sense to anyone, but I thought about it and it did to me.</p>

			<p>To hotfoot982:<br />
I know what you&#8217;re saying.  It isn&#8217;t random, the number that is facing up is corresponded to the conditions of the table, the force you use on the die, the trajectory of it, the position of release of the die&#8230; etc&#8230; But if the conditions are EXACTLY the same, each time you roll the die with those EXACT conditions (impossible to do with a human, or even a machine maybe) the die will always land up on the same number.  It&#8217;s not random, it&#8217;s based on a &#8220;seed&#8221;, which is all of the said conditions bundled up together, just like a computer would make a &#8220;random&#8221; number.  If people couldn&#8217;t understand it from your explanation, I hope they understand mine :-P.</p>
<p>     - Derg</p>
<p>P.S. I almost forgot to congratulate you Sean!  Now I&#8217;ll really have to consider the law of attraction and everything like that&#8230; I&#8217;ve read stories and heard things from word of mouth about how it helped people I know, and I really have to try this out now :-).</p>

I had contemplated this argument.  The idea is that if you know every little particle inside the system, and know exactly where it&#8217;s moving, then you could calculate exactly where it&#8217;ll end up.  I.e., if you knew every piece of data, you could predict the dice roll.  However, there is a flaw in this logic:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very important, imho, that we recognize that we can&#8217;t MECHANICALLY predict dice rolls.  In fact, I believe prediction in itself is impossible.  I&#8217;ll post more on this idea the more I talk about randomness.</p>

			<p>YOU GUYS ARE MAKING TOO MUCH OUT OF NOTHING! HOLY COW!</p>
<p>Now on to business. Scratch off tickets are like going to slot machines, sometimes you win and sometimes you don&#8217;t. The reason more people win on scratch off tickets and slot machines is because the odds for winning smaller amounts are decidably lower than say the millions of the lottery, and the jackpot on slot machines. My dad is constantly going to the casino and he will win maybe 20 dollars one week, and then lose 30 the next, win 45, then lose 25. Are these winning significant? Not really, because they aren&#8217;t really enough to tip the scales in either direction. Congratulations on winning, but until you win the lottery or something stacked in odds of around 1.44 million to 13 million, than I think this would fall under the category of winnings just like all the other small wins.</p>
<p>As for this whole dice conversation. This video basically solves your whole argument, you can thank me later.</p>

			<p>Howdy Sean,</p>
<p>Hey buddy, It’s been a while. I haven’t spoken to you since the last night in the chat. I hope all is well. I like your blog. It contains some interesting ideas and perspectives. The last time we spoke, a lot of things have changed in my perception. This happens to be one of the topics that I’ve personally dwelled into for quite some time now :-}</p>
<p>The Law of Attraction! Basically, the law of attraction basically states that whatever you think, you attract into your life. In a sense, you manifest everything that you think. You’re the creator and bearer of your own reality due to your thoughts. Thoughts, ideas, emotions, intentions, wishes (etc) all apparently create your reality. </p>
<p>Quantum Physics is starting to expose this theory as well. One theory that Quantum physicists around the globe agree upon is that we can not have a universe without the mind. The mind is shaping the very thing being perceived from the perspective of the individual. We’re basically observers in a sense. But observers with the power to manifest what he/she perceives as believable. Now of course this is but a theory. One of many. But like the theory of entanglement, it’s being debated significantly. Each side sharing good points.</p>
<p>In your blog, you’re explaining your theory of intentions bringing upon manifestation. You’re also explaining your theory of randomness and how it doesn’t exist. You and I share similar ideas and theories. If you break a thought down, it’s rather interesting. It is now scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is 100 times more powerful than a negative one. What is a thought made of? Well, a thought is manifested by the individual perceiving and/or acknowledging something. A thought is carried through electrical frequencies throughout the brain. What is a frequency made up of? Energy. What is energy? Everything :-} </p>
<p>The theory of the law of attraction states that since everything is made up of energy, whatever emit, we’ll attract. This means, and I’ll use your lottery experiment for my example; that if you were to intend to profit from playing the lottery, and you fully believe it’s obtainable, you’ll manifest it. How is one doing that?  Hypothetically speaking, the law of attraction states that you’re like a magnet. If you’re intending something is specific, you’ll attract it. If you’re emitting positive thoughts, or negative thoughts, you’ll attract either positive or negative aspects into your reality. </p>
<p>I myself experimented with the Law of Attraction. To be quite blunt, I was extremely satisfied. I joined the Air Force. I singed up for the several jobs they offered me. I wanted a medical job. One of the recruiters at the processing center (MEPS) clearly stated that medial jobs were hard to obtain. When I started to research the Law of Attraction, I thought that getting my ideal job in the Air Force would be a grand manifestation. When I received my letter in the mail, not only did I get the job I wanted, I’m shipping out on the date I intended on leaving on as well. The recruiter called me later that week and wanted to congratulate me as well as tell me how lucky I was to obtain that job. :-} </p>
<p>I’ve used the law of attraction on many occasions. I am quite convinced that randomness doesn’t exist. I fully believe that if intended, any individual can manifest and structure his/her own reality. Everyone has their own reality, their own truth. The law of attraction concurs with that theory greatly. How one constructs his/her own reality is based on what the perceiver (The individual) believes is possible. If that individual believes that the lottery is impossible to win, then guess what? How likely is it that he/she is going to win? You’re manifesting that conclusion due to your thoughts that you’re not going to win. This goes for everything. Possibilities are in the grasp of the idealist. </p>
<p>I’ve read The Magic of Believing. Excellent book. I found it really intriguing. However, I would have to say that my research on the Law of attraction in specific benefited me the outmost. Sean, I recommend reading books based on the law of attraction. I also recommend greatly picking up the DVD “The Secret”. It’s very intriguing and I fully believe that you‘ll enjoy it.</p>
<p>Of course we can not scientifically preach “This is how it works”, but it certainly is something that is being researched and gossiped upon currently by the scientific community. I recommend experimenting more, Sean. It certainly is an interesting subject to dwell upon. I’ll continue to do so as well. My apologies if I got all philosophical on you. I share a lot of enthusiasm when discussing this topic <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>&#8220;All that we are is a result of what we have thought&#8221; - Buddha</p>
<p>Talk to you later buddy,</p>
<p>~ JoeT</p>

			<p>This sounds all well and good right now, but I just can&#8217;t see cause and effect applying to your intentions and winnings. The tickets were already in your hand. The tickets already have numbers on them which are either winners or losers. We know this because there are machines which chew out these tickets, and they probably have to have their ink refilled now and again for example. So these tickets with these numbers are already in your hand, which already makes them winners or losers. I can&#8217;t believe that any amount of intention will manifest a manipulation of the very ink on those tickets so that a series of numbers change to another series of numbers. This just doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, if you see a roll of tickets and you have the intention of buying a winning ticket, but every time somebody purchases a ticket it comes off the very end of the roll; then still I can&#8217;t see your intention being able to affect a change. If there is a possibility for randomness (or, if you prefer, perceived randomnes) then perhaps. Ie - if there were a number of tickets in a hat, and you drew one out &#8216;at random&#8217; after projecting the intention of getting a winning ticket. In this case, some force could create a &#8216;magnetic&#8217; attraction between your hand and a winning ticket already in that hat and voila! However, this also presupposes there *is* a winning ticket in that hat as well.</p>
<p>I dunno, I just can&#8217;t get my mind around the idea that you can get a winning ticket due to intention when there is already a fixed physicality - ie, the ticket is already in your hand, or you are only able to get the next ticket on a roll or some such. Does anybody have any non-fluffy answers?</p>
<p>Well, irrelevant of all that - congratulations on your winnings (small as they may be =P)</p>

<p>thats true. but, considering me and (I&#8217;m sure) many other people here have seen the future now and then, it could very well be that time isn&#8217;t the way most people think of it, thus using attraction to change the past may somehow be possible.</p>
<p>or, it may also be that such energy-based things aren&#8217;t limited by the boundaries of time, and that an attraction created now may be able to exist in another time.<br />
(while these two points may sound the same, the are actually different ideas. it&#8217;s just that I suck at explaining stuff&#8230;)</p>
<p>course, we&#8217;re here to talk about randomness, not time :P. I just thought I&#8217;d throw out the idea that attraction may still work even when you already have the cards.</p>
<p>oh, and congrats on your slight winnings. though I agree that, at this point, they shouldn&#8217;t be taken to heart.</p>

			<p>And last month I made $560 at the casino off a single $20 bill off of a single slot-machine in a single spin.  The old lady sitting next to me said &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen that happen, and I&#8217;ve been playing this game for years!&#8221; than I stood up and said &#8220;My work here is done&#8221; and went to the ticket counter to cash-out.  I walked-in, sat-down, won, stood-up, cashed-out and then left.</p>
<p>I should go back and try again.  ^__^</p>

     Hey it&#8217;s no problem, even though I personally would say I made it 89% better <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>To Sean:<br />
     That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  I should delve more into the quantum mechanics, they&#8217;re interesting reading.  Hmm&#8230;  I don&#8217;t see the flaw, my proposal was purely hypothetical.  I see how it would be completely impossible to build a machine to throw the dice the same exact way every time, or even measure the exact dimensions.  I was just proposing that if it was possible to know exactly everything about the die throw and replicate it, the same exact result would happen.  Same number, same location.</p>
<p>To Tsumaru:<br />
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger%27s_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger%27s_cat</a> would help explain it.  Shrodinger&#8217;s cat basically says that if you don&#8217;t know the outcome of something supposedly &#8220;random&#8221; like the numbers on a lottery ticket or whether the cat is alive or dead, it exists in both states (winning/non winning, alive/dead) until an observation is made.</p>
<p>*phew* now I&#8217;m gonna go read the new post and see what I can&#8217;t get out of that.</p>

			<p>[&#8230;] also like to note that I haven&#8217;t bought any lottery tickets since my last winning, so this isn&#8217;t a case of playing a whole lot to win a few times  - I&#8217;m making a [&#8230;]</p>
