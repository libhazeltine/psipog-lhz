		<description>Oneta - 
Thanks for the video, thats exactly what I mean.

		<description>To hotfoot:
     Hey it's no problem, even though I personally would say I made it 89% better :-P

To Sean:
     That's an interesting idea.  I should delve more into the quantum mechanics, they're interesting reading.  Hmm...  I don't see the flaw, my proposal was purely hypothetical.  I see how it would be completely impossible to build a machine to throw the dice the same exact way every time, or even measure the exact dimensions.  I was just proposing that if it was possible to know exactly everything about the die throw and replicate it, the same exact result would happen.  Same number, same location.

To Tsumaru:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger%27s_cat would help explain it.  Shrodinger's cat basically says that if you don't know the outcome of something supposedly "random" like the numbers on a lottery ticket or whether the cat is alive or dead, it exists in both states (winning/non winning, alive/dead) until an observation is made.

*phew* now I'm gonna go read the new post and see what I can't get out of that.</description>

		<description>And last month I made $560 at the casino off a single $20 bill off of a single slot-machine in a single spin.  The old lady sitting next to me said "I've never seen that happen, and I've been playing this game for years!" than I stood up and said "My work here is done" and went to the ticket counter to cash-out.  I walked-in, sat-down, won, stood-up, cashed-out and then left.

I should go back and try again.  ^__^</description>

		<description>"but I just can’t see cause and effect applying to your intentions and winnings. The tickets were already in your hand. The tickets already have numbers on them which are either winners or losers."


thats true. but, considering me and (I'm sure) many other people here have seen the future now and then, it could very well be that time isn't the way most people think of it, thus using attraction to change the past may somehow be possible.

or, it may also be that such energy-based things aren't limited by the boundaries of time, and that an attraction created now may be able to exist in another time.
(while these two points may sound the same, the are actually different ideas. it's just that I suck at explaining stuff...)

course, we're here to talk about randomness, not time :P. I just thought I'd throw out the idea that attraction may still work even when you already have the cards.


oh, and congrats on your slight winnings. though I agree that, at this point, they shouldn't be taken to heart.</description>

		<description>This sounds all well and good right now, but I just can't see cause and effect applying to your intentions and winnings. The tickets were already in your hand. The tickets already have numbers on them which are either winners or losers. We know this because there are machines which chew out these tickets, and they probably have to have their ink refilled now and again for example. So these tickets with these numbers are already in your hand, which already makes them winners or losers. I can't believe that any amount of intention will manifest a manipulation of the very ink on those tickets so that a series of numbers change to another series of numbers. This just doesn't make sense to me.

In a similar vein, if you see a roll of tickets and you have the intention of buying a winning ticket, but every time somebody purchases a ticket it comes off the very end of the roll; then still I can't see your intention being able to affect a change. If there is a possibility for randomness (or, if you prefer, perceived randomnes) then perhaps. Ie - if there were a number of tickets in a hat, and you drew one out 'at random' after projecting the intention of getting a winning ticket. In this case, some force could create a 'magnetic' attraction between your hand and a winning ticket already in that hat and voila! However, this also presupposes there *is* a winning ticket in that hat as well.

I dunno, I just can't get my mind around the idea that you can get a winning ticket due to intention when there is already a fixed physicality - ie, the ticket is already in your hand, or you are only able to get the next ticket on a roll or some such. Does anybody have any non-fluffy answers?


Well, irrelevant of all that - congratulations on your winnings (small as they may be =P)</description>

		<description>Howdy Sean,

Hey buddy, It’s been a while. I haven’t spoken to you since the last night in the chat. I hope all is well. I like your blog. It contains some interesting ideas and perspectives. The last time we spoke, a lot of things have changed in my perception. This happens to be one of the topics that I’ve personally dwelled into for quite some time now :-}

The Law of Attraction! Basically, the law of attraction basically states that whatever you think, you attract into your life. In a sense, you manifest everything that you think. You’re the creator and bearer of your own reality due to your thoughts. Thoughts, ideas, emotions, intentions, wishes (etc) all apparently create your reality. 

Quantum Physics is starting to expose this theory as well. One theory that Quantum physicists around the globe agree upon is that we can not have a universe without the mind. The mind is shaping the very thing being perceived from the perspective of the individual. We’re basically observers in a sense. But observers with the power to manifest what he/she perceives as believable. Now of course this is but a theory. One of many. But like the theory of entanglement, it’s being debated significantly. Each side sharing good points.

In your blog, you’re explaining your theory of intentions bringing upon manifestation. You’re also explaining your theory of randomness and how it doesn’t exist. You and I share similar ideas and theories. If you break a thought down, it’s rather interesting. It is now scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is 100 times more powerful than a negative one. What is a thought made of? Well, a thought is manifested by the individual perceiving and/or acknowledging something. A thought is carried through electrical frequencies throughout the brain. What is a frequency made up of? Energy. What is energy? Everything :-} 

The theory of the law of attraction states that since everything is made up of energy, whatever emit, we’ll attract. This means, and I’ll use your lottery experiment for my example; that if you were to intend to profit from playing the lottery, and you fully believe it’s obtainable, you’ll manifest it. How is one doing that?  Hypothetically speaking, the law of attraction states that you’re like a magnet. If you’re intending something is specific, you’ll attract it. If you’re emitting positive thoughts, or negative thoughts, you’ll attract either positive or negative aspects into your reality. 

I myself experimented with the Law of Attraction. To be quite blunt, I was extremely satisfied. I joined the Air Force. I singed up for the several jobs they offered me. I wanted a medical job. One of the recruiters at the processing center (MEPS) clearly stated that medial jobs were hard to obtain. When I started to research the Law of Attraction, I thought that getting my ideal job in the Air Force would be a grand manifestation. When I received my letter in the mail, not only did I get the job I wanted, I’m shipping out on the date I intended on leaving on as well. The recruiter called me later that week and wanted to congratulate me as well as tell me how lucky I was to obtain that job. :-} 

I’ve used the law of attraction on many occasions. I am quite convinced that randomness doesn’t exist. I fully believe that if intended, any individual can manifest and structure his/her own reality. Everyone has their own reality, their own truth. The law of attraction concurs with that theory greatly. How one constructs his/her own reality is based on what the perceiver (The individual) believes is possible. If that individual believes that the lottery is impossible to win, then guess what? How likely is it that he/she is going to win? You’re manifesting that conclusion due to your thoughts that you’re not going to win. This goes for everything. Possibilities are in the grasp of the idealist. 

I’ve read The Magic of Believing. Excellent book. I found it really intriguing. However, I would have to say that my research on the Law of attraction in specific benefited me the outmost. Sean, I recommend reading books based on the law of attraction. I also recommend greatly picking up the DVD “The Secret”. It’s very intriguing and I fully believe that you‘ll enjoy it.

Of course we can not scientifically preach “This is how it works”, but it certainly is something that is being researched and gossiped upon currently by the scientific community. I recommend experimenting more, Sean. It certainly is an interesting subject to dwell upon. I’ll continue to do so as well. My apologies if I got all philosophical on you. I share a lot of enthusiasm when discussing this topic :-)

		<description>YOU GUYS ARE MAKING TOO MUCH OUT OF NOTHING! HOLY COW!

Now on to business. Scratch off tickets are like going to slot machines, sometimes you win and sometimes you don't. The reason more people win on scratch off tickets and slot machines is because the odds for winning smaller amounts are decidably lower than say the millions of the lottery, and the jackpot on slot machines. My dad is constantly going to the casino and he will win maybe 20 dollars one week, and then lose 30 the next, win 45, then lose 25. Are these winning significant? Not really, because they aren't really enough to tip the scales in either direction. Congratulations on winning, but until you win the lottery or something stacked in odds of around 1.44 million to 13 million, than I think this would fall under the category of winnings just like all the other small wins.

As for this whole dice conversation. This video basically solves your whole argument, you can thank me later.

		<description>WHOA!
when I saw the post say "I won" I thought it was the millions ^_^
still, you got the profit as you had intended for in these scrath-off tickets.
Congrats 8)</description>
