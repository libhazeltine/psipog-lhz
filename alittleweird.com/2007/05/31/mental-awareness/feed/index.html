		<description>I find that when I wake up, I hear very random things, a voice that seem to talk about what I just dreamed about. I just walk to the bathroom listening to it like a radio station. Oh, and the voice is very loud in the morning. At night, I hear the voice again. This time, it's more like answers to random questions I ask in my head about the day. I wish I wrote down what it said one night because it wasn't my own thought at all. It was a beautiful answer about friendship and how it's best to be different from everyone else. I forgot it and I regret not writing it down.

Sometimes I write lyrics at night before I sleep. I find this very helpful. The better lines are the one I give least thought about. The ones that turn out icky are the ones that I count syllables and timing and think about too much. I think this may enhanced my inner voice a lot, but I don't want to say something cheesy like "it comes from the inner soul". No, I think it's the subconcious. Now, I could say random things in my head in a day and it seems to argue back or say something. It's so hard to tell whether it's my own thoughts or my inner voice. It never sounds like what I'd ever think of. I never tell anyone this because I'm still not sure myself what this all means. I've a weird reputation with my family alreay. 

I wonder, could the subconcious be more effective after waking up and the time before sleep comes?</description>

		<description>Thank you for all of your answers everyone. :)

h4ckluserr: Ahh, the old "first answer." That really annoys me sometimes. By the fact that I don't listen to it. I would need an answer to something and I just feel the answer immediately, but then, my mind says otherwise. It tells me that it is another answer. And the mind's answer is wrong, while the subconscious answer is right. 
I guess I just trust the thing that is always with me, thought. Perhaps if one would break down the thought process, one would trust his/her subconscious? 

(Well, today is final exams for me, I guess it's time to give it a test run. :) )</description>

		<description>After reading Bentinho's comment, something hit me.  My old physics teacher in high school always said "go with your first response, otherwise you will get it wrong." now at the time, he was a cookey Physics teacher who just said weird things.  With a little hindsight and thinking, i came to realize, this was an allusion to the suboncious, as Bentinho said "it comes back to you immediately..."  I tested this theory by pulling out an old physics exam from high school (a solid one years worth of dust) and low and behold when i took it and saw the result, it was a 98% that was one question wrong.  Just another two bits to process I thought I should share.</description>

		<description>Hello Sean,

Good to see your new website. This one suits you much better now in my opinion.

Very good explanation and very essential it is to witness the mind when it is active. 

If I may be so free to give my opinion to Somefatguy: in my experience the subconscious is allknowing. It memorizes everything as well and is not bound by time. As Sean said, it is a matter of listening. The subconscious doesn't need to be refined. It is our conscious mental field that needs the fine-tuning. 

When you are doing a test for example, just intend to remember what you learned and then let it go... it comes back to you immediately, most of the times. It won't help you if you try very hard to remember, it will only narrow the tunnel through which the subconscious sends out its knowledge to you. All you need is the intention to receive the answer or memory, and then immediately let it flow. It will flow back, you will 'remember' the answer to your question suddenly. Just listen carefully without forcing anything. The tunnel of information becomes much wider if you are relaxed.

I don't know what Sean's experience is with making tests and remembering, but this is how remembering works for me. Making tests correctly without consciously remembering the answer? Just say you want to fill in the right answer, and start filling in the answer. Don't think about what would be the right answer according to your cubsconscious, because it doesn't matter which answer you decide to give or choose, it will be the right one, if that was your intention and if the tunnel was solid-wide. After doing this some times, you will get a clear feeling of what is the right answer. So then the doubt will start to dissolve and trust in your ability to listen will grow. In my experience you will even start to know things suddenly that you cannot possibly know through the normal means of cause and effect. You just know.

Sorry if it is inappropriate to answer your question SFG, as it was aimed at Sean. 

Nice blog/website Sean, keep the good info coming,

		<description>6 - 8 months before you felt you could personify a person from you sub-c?? Wow, it took me about a week to be in full sync with my sub-c. I mostly ask it to remember things which, by the way, works great. A few times I would say "sub-c remember this paper is due at x/x/x". It would then tell me either very early or just before the due date so that I have enough time to work on it.</description>

		<description>somefatguy:

I don't know about blunt memorization, but in my experience, if I teach myself a little trick to remember something, I can have my subconscious memorize the *process.* 

example: I parked in spot #1082,  and 8+2=10, which I remember because the sum of all the digits comes down to 2. I tell my sub-C to remind me to use the "sum process," as I call it, later in the day.

I don't know if this works with everyone, and I'm particularly math-logic oriented, but it's worth trying. Also, I grew up in Florida's theme parks, so maybe this is just a natural part of my sub-C.</description>

		<description>somefatguy: 
Lol. I think I remember Sean saying something like he took a highlighter, than let his sub-c highlight the answer. I wish I could do that, and hope I will learn ;).

But that would be cool if the subc could memorize things, quickly too...

		<description>Sean, I recall you saying that the subconscious is useful for school. 
If so, I would mainly like it for memorization, can the subconscious memorize things well? 
(such as 60 definitions word for word? :))</description>

		<description>Quieting my mind can be difficult, so I think I'll try this method. 

Sort of reminds me of something. I once read that if you have positive thoughts, you can tell by your emotions (which should be positive too). However I felt like I always had positive thoughts but always felt apathetic or depressed. Then, I started focusing on my thoughts more and realized that all the positive thoughts I have are the ones I'm aware of, but if I focus more, there's about a million negative thoughts in the background that's constantly flowing in my head throughout the day. It was strange because I'd never really noticed them before, since they became such an ingrained part of me. But yeah, I've been happier since I became aware of that. :) Well, this was sort of random but I thought it was related.</description>
