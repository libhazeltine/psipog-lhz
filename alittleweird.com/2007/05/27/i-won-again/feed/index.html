		<description>My subc doesn't seem to like giving me money, he only seems to help me find shortcuts and more scenic routes to specific areas that I walk to from time to time. lol</description>

		<description>dayummm....
But yeah, i could probably show this to a lot more people if you had a "censored" edition where you had someone else say a nicer word "heck, really, etc." in a voice-over.

		<description>So basically...you are my new hero. I've been trying to listen and communicate with my subconscious and it seems to be working...I'm not so good at it yet, but I'm working on it. Plus, this video made me laugh because 1. You were listening to lostprophets which makes me smile, 2. You cuss like a sailor and that makes me smile, and 3. My mom would give me lottery tickets to scratch when I was like 7 and if I won she'd cash them for me and give me the money, and I almost always won simply because I already knew I would. Child's minds are wonderful things.</description>

		<description>"Next time, I’ll try and use it to find a winner."

Pretty good theory, just go to a store. If your subc tells you you're not winning here, then walk out of the store and find a new one. REPEAT UNTIL WIN. :P</description>
