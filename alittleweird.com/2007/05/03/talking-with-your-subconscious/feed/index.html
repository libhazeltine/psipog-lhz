		<description>Wonderful guide... I've tried this out once before, but I couldn't get it to work.  Maybe it's time to revisit talking to my subconscious.</description>

		<description>Thanks for writing this, I'll definitely be trying this out tonight.

I have a question though -- when you say emotion, is it an emotion like any other emotion we feel on a day-to-day basis, or does it have a slightly different quality? Is this emotion also located in the chest area?</description>

		<description>A very thorough guide. I wonder if this could be the cause of a sudden   random moment of pure joy and happiness (i think it may be called euphoria). I will definitely try this and hopefully ill be able to listen clearly in this distracting world now-a-days. :)</description>

		<description>I think this may be the same for telepathy. When I'm receiving and I quickly give an answer to just get it over with, I'm usually not right. If I really try to not make it up and just sit and wait for it, I either get nothing or it pops up.</description>

		<description>Nice How to.
I've tried this some time before, after having read that book about OBEs by Robert Peterson, but I should probably spend more time to get things going.

I'm glad you're writing again. :)</description>
