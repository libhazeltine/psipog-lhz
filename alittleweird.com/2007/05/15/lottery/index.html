			<div class="entry">
				<p>I&#8217;ve become convinced I can win the lottery :-).</p>
<p>My obsession started at the beginning of March.  I had heard on the news that the <a href="http://megamillions.com/">MegaMillions</a> jackpot was at a record <a href="http://megamillions.com/winningpicks/draw_details.asp?date=3/6/2007">$390 million</a>.  I was visiting my father in Georgia, and he asked me what I would do if I won that much money.  I&#8217;m sure his question was just an innocent way to talk about something for a little bit.  I think I may have taken the question a little too seriously :-).</p>
<p>I started to really think about what I would do with that much money.  What would I <em>really</em> do.  It dominated my thoughts for quite a while.</p>
<p>Then I remembered talking to my friend about the lottery, a few months prior to my Georgia visit.  We were talking about how reality is not some machine, and that modern science doesn&#8217;t give it enough credit.  I had told him about a news article I had read, where<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fstories%2F2005%2F06%2F15%2Fearlyshow%2Fliving%2Fmain701972.shtml&amp;ei=6rRJRuqcMpOuwQKDstmKCw&amp;usg=AFrqEzci6mfWoumbDvg2buS-LfZBLBieTA&amp;sig2=a1owr2d7dCNMS7is3hnT9A"> a lady won the lottery twice</a>.  I tried to get my friend to understand that this simply should NEVER REALISTICALLY HAPPEN - according to statistics and probability.  The fact that it has happened is evidence that things aren&#8217;t what they seem.</p>
<p>Thinking about the lady winning twice, and thinking about the question of what I would do with $390 million dollars&#8230; I became convinced that if someone else can do it - then so can I.  I started playing MegaMillions, and made a goal to figure out how others have won, and how I could win myself.</p>
<p>All this thinking led me to a realization.  I realized that randomness doesn&#8217;t truly exist.  I may post on this idea later, but the general idea is that nothing in this world is truly random.  Where the modern worlds sees random occurrences, what they&#8217;re really witnessing is a subconscious choice - but they can&#8217;t figure it out, so they just simplify it to this idea of &#8220;random&#8221;, so they don&#8217;t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Once I had made this realization, the next time I played the lottery I won.  $3 to be exact (odds 1 in 141).  I was pretty happy, and I kept thinking about this idea of randomness - and won again the next drawing.  $7 this time (odds 1 in 306).  Back to back, the &#8220;odds&#8221; of winning twice is 1 in 43,146.  You may disagree with the math, but the fact still remains that I had only played 5 tickets at that point, and 2 of them had been winners.</p>
<p>That sealed the deal.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve continued to play the lottery, but haven&#8217;t won yet.  I&#8217;m convinced that I can win.  If someone can win twice, I can win once.  And if I can win once, I can win a hundred times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very interesting to me.  I&#8217;ll post on it later :-).</p>

			<p>Nice point of view and I think you&#8217;re quite right, even though one should not generalize.<br />
In a book by Paulo Coelho is stated that if a thing happens once to someone, there is no reason why it should not happen again. furthermore if something happens twice to someone it will almost certainly occur a 3rd time.<br />
In fact, the boy was robbed 3 times. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
I feel that this way of thinking can easily be adopted and make us more positive. I&#8217;ll watch out the next days and tell you, if I can influence things that happen to me. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Sounds like a great idea to me. I&#8217;ve read about intention manifestation, and if that has any sense to it at all, you should be able to win in the long run. Good luck! (If there is such a thing)</p>

<p>You made me think about randomness, and you seem to be right, there is no such thing as randomness.<br />
Wow&#8230;it&#8217;s got me thinking.</p>

			<p>haha, nice job. </p>
<p>and i defiantly agree about the randomness thing. i&#8217;ve felt that way for some time now, though my feelings on the matter have strengthened as of late.<br />
randomly: sometimes, out of boredom, i&#8217;ll grab my calculator and start playing around with the random number generator. i&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s notably common for it to throw out &#8216;cool&#8217; sorta numbers (88.888, 42.42, 37.73, 15.151, 16). probably about 1/5 of my numbers are this sort of thing (yea, i know. i&#8217;m strange :P)</p>
<p>anyway, good job with what you&#8217;ve done so far. though, even if it isn&#8217;t really random, i&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s morally right to try winning this way, but thats just me &gt;.&gt;</p>

			<p>Great Idea with the intention manifestation, just be sure to actually buy the tickets when a number comes to mind. I won the lottery once, but the ticket ws never purchased, I could have sworn I had bought it!!<br />
oh well, as you say, it can happen again <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif' alt='8)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>This reminds me of when i was younger. It was the 90&#8217;s and coke was giving away free bottles of cola if you got lucky with there caps (this was before everyone had internet so it wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;enter this code online&#8221; crap either) and i would walk to a pizzeria down the street with my mom a couple times a month. Everytime i would go i would stand in front of the big glass doors where the sodas were kept and without thinking i would just pick one. At first i thought i was just realy lucky cuz i would always win another bottle of coke. Heh it realy wasn&#8217;t too unbelievable either cuz it was something like 1/20 which isn&#8217;t too hard to get. Well&#8230; i&#8217;ll never forget after a while i would walk in and i could garantee my mother that if she baught me a bottle of coke i would get her one for free and it never failed. The guy behind the counter always said it was cute how lucky i was and i remember this because i was an evil little two faced brat who would always smile and look cute but then when i was alone with my mom i would tell her how stupid people were. Anyways heh.. eventualy this just faded out. I never realy thought anything of it untill i read this post and it came back like some sort of cheesy movie flashback.</p>

			<p>some perple say the more you play the better your chances of winning</p>
<p>i know people who puy one ticket at raffles and win the biggest basket<br />
my mom plays about 4 sheets of bingo cards at once and she still gets beat by the older women with 1 sheet<br />
chance and luck are all beliefs</p>

			<p>delimew, to be fair, the weird &#8216;random&#8217; numbers on a calculator aren&#8217;t really an indication of anything.  Same for computers in general.  They aren&#8217;t able to generate &#8216;random&#8217; numbers, all it is a long non-rational number with no pattern, so it appears to be random enough for most purposes.  To randomize it a bit more some most computers will also use seed values such as the current time to jump in at a differnet point in the number to change things up.  But actually, if you figure out what the seed value a computer uses to generate random numbers, you can get the same one time and time again.</p>
<p>Until we go to quantum computing, random numbers are just an illusion.</p>

			<p>well, i suppose that is true. though, all things considered, i still believe there&#8217;s something else to it. and it&#8217;s not like i&#8217;ve got repeats of the same number, but i suppose your point does still stand.</p>
<p>btw, it&#8217;s not like i don&#8217;t know of any other times that show how un-random things really are.</p>
<p>like this story i heard on the news a year or so ago. some trucker&#8217;s truck broke down in the middle of the open road, and when he stopped to do whatever with it, he noticed a car that had crashed some way off-road (you&#8217;d never notice it if you just passed straight by) turns out that said car still had live people in it, but they were too severely injured to do anything. if the truck hadn&#8217;t broke down where it had, they&#8217;d have almost certain died. now, of all the places for the truck to break down, what are the odds it would be right where/when it would save someones life? <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>or, a less important example, there was a time when there was something on TV later on that night that i really wanted to watch, so i turned the TV on and just left it muted. i then spent my time doing stuff on the computer. thing is, i got so into that that i completely forgot about the TV. then, less than a min before my movie started, my TV turned itself off than back on (it does that very rarely), which caused it to unmute. this of course reminded me that i wanted to watch something. the timing of this was just too perfect to be considered chance</p>
<p>heh, it&#8217;s kinda cool when you think about how much this sorta thing must happen. these are, of course, just a few examples that i can think of. and theres bound to be many many more things just as weird <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>I think that&#8217;s called synchronicity. Ever since my dad started meditating, he&#8217;s had a synchronistic event almost once a day (such as, his car breaks down, a tow truck shows up, he ignores it, another one shows up). For some people, practically everything that happens to them is synchronistic (or so I hear).</p>
<p>By the way, there&#8217;s a good book by Michael Talbot called the Holographic Universe.</p>

			<p>When I fully get myself to believe something &#8220;random&#8221; or much of anything will happen, it does, which is pretty much following what you described.  It usually fails though when I give it a second thought, I don&#8217;t noramlly think in the manner of that it will definetly happen, maybe just not now, and when I do, it gives a lot of time for doubt, which would tends to cause it not to happen.  BELIEVE IT!</p>
