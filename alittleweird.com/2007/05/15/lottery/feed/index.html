		<description>"Until we go to quantum computing, random numbers are just an illusion."

The only reason Quantum physics seems random is because they don't understand it enough yet to decipher set patterns.</description>

		<description>When I fully get myself to believe something "random" or much of anything will happen, it does, which is pretty much following what you described.  It usually fails though when I give it a second thought, I don't noramlly think in the manner of that it will definetly happen, maybe just not now, and when I do, it gives a lot of time for doubt, which would tends to cause it not to happen.  BELIEVE IT!</description>

		<description>I think that's called synchronicity. Ever since my dad started meditating, he's had a synchronistic event almost once a day (such as, his car breaks down, a tow truck shows up, he ignores it, another one shows up). For some people, practically everything that happens to them is synchronistic (or so I hear).

By the way, there's a good book by Michael Talbot called the Holographic Universe.</description>

		<description>well, i suppose that is true. though, all things considered, i still believe there's something else to it. and it's not like i've got repeats of the same number, but i suppose your point does still stand.


btw, it's not like i don't know of any other times that show how un-random things really are.

like this story i heard on the news a year or so ago. some trucker's truck broke down in the middle of the open road, and when he stopped to do whatever with it, he noticed a car that had crashed some way off-road (you'd never notice it if you just passed straight by) turns out that said car still had live people in it, but they were too severely injured to do anything. if the truck hadn't broke down where it had, they'd have almost certain died. now, of all the places for the truck to break down, what are the odds it would be right where/when it would save someones life? :P


or, a less important example, there was a time when there was something on TV later on that night that i really wanted to watch, so i turned the TV on and just left it muted. i then spent my time doing stuff on the computer. thing is, i got so into that that i completely forgot about the TV. then, less than a min before my movie started, my TV turned itself off than back on (it does that very rarely), which caused it to unmute. this of course reminded me that i wanted to watch something. the timing of this was just too perfect to be considered chance



heh, it's kinda cool when you think about how much this sorta thing must happen. these are, of course, just a few examples that i can think of. and theres bound to be many many more things just as weird :P</description>

		<description>delimew, to be fair, the weird 'random' numbers on a calculator aren't really an indication of anything.  Same for computers in general.  They aren't able to generate 'random' numbers, all it is a long non-rational number with no pattern, so it appears to be random enough for most purposes.  To randomize it a bit more some most computers will also use seed values such as the current time to jump in at a differnet point in the number to change things up.  But actually, if you figure out what the seed value a computer uses to generate random numbers, you can get the same one time and time again.

Until we go to quantum computing, random numbers are just an illusion.</description>

		<description>some perple say the more you play the better your chances of winning

i know people who puy one ticket at raffles and win the biggest basket
my mom plays about 4 sheets of bingo cards at once and she still gets beat by the older women with 1 sheet 
chance and luck are all beliefs</description>

		<description>This reminds me of when i was younger. It was the 90's and coke was giving away free bottles of cola if you got lucky with there caps (this was before everyone had internet so it wasn't the "enter this code online" crap either) and i would walk to a pizzeria down the street with my mom a couple times a month. Everytime i would go i would stand in front of the big glass doors where the sodas were kept and without thinking i would just pick one. At first i thought i was just realy lucky cuz i would always win another bottle of coke. Heh it realy wasn't too unbelievable either cuz it was something like 1/20 which isn't too hard to get. Well... i'll never forget after a while i would walk in and i could garantee my mother that if she baught me a bottle of coke i would get her one for free and it never failed. The guy behind the counter always said it was cute how lucky i was and i remember this because i was an evil little two faced brat who would always smile and look cute but then when i was alone with my mom i would tell her how stupid people were. Anyways heh.. eventualy this just faded out. I never realy thought anything of it untill i read this post and it came back like some sort of cheesy movie flashback.</description>

		<description>Great Idea with the intention manifestation, just be sure to actually buy the tickets when a number comes to mind. I won the lottery once, but the ticket ws never purchased, I could have sworn I had bought it!!
oh well, as you say, it can happen again 8)</description>
