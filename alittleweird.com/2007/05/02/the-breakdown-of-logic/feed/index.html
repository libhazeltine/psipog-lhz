		<description>I agree with your point, but not with the last example. I offcourse don't know how well you are able to get inside your friend's head, but I think it is just as possible he was fully conscious about the irreality of his reason not to work on the project. He created an excuse (while being conscious of the fact it's an excuse, so not feeling it as being reality), and offcourse it should be a logical excuse by the way he thinks.</description>

		<description>I once read a text in class about the scientific approach to problems, where the solution must be found by an unbiased way of thinking.
One sentence I remember from that text was that we actually use our mind not to make up an opinion, but to support an opinion we've made up before really thinking about it. (influenced by our environment, beliefs, media, etc.) 

I think the same reasoning can be applied here. We should ergo try to detect, when we use logic to support a preconceived opinion.</description>

		<description>Good Article, you really know how to get a guy's brain working.  If you could put some stuff about speaking with your subconscious mind up, that would be greatly appreciated.</description>

		<description>Yet again, another great and thought provoking article :)
I can easily relate to that laziness belief; it's made me give up a number of things for a subconscious fear of criticism.

Keep up the good work!</description>
