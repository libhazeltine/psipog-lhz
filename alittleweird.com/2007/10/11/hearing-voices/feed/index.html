		<description>I've had similar things as well. Most of the time it's a stream of thought that has nothing to do with what I'm currently thinking of, but it interjects loudly. The next thing I think is always: "I didn't think that... or did I?"

The interjections seem much like a voice cutting in across my train of thought, but was it really another voice, or me? One thing is plain: it always affects me profoundly... for the time being.

Rarely will I actually hear voices, though. Mostly it's (as your experience was) waking in the morning. Occasionally it's when I'm getting dazey in the afternoons (melatonin spike!). :-)</description>

		<description>I was awoken by my little dog the other night, she whines when she's thirsty or needs to go outside.  It usually takes a while for the whining to wake me, though I'm not sure how long since I'm barely conscious at best.

The last time she woke me, I had what I think was an acronym resonating in my mind.  It was either "T.C.F." or "T.C.R." or something like that.  I was aware of it when I woke up, but didn't really understand.  I never thought it was something external, rather probably something subconscious, but it was definitely the first time I experienced something like that.

Maybe I was thinking "TFSU" directed at my dog :)

		<description>I forget the exact wording of this, but the idea was that eventually inaction makes the action for you. Example: If you're unsure whether to go to the gym or to go go to a movie that's playing in 20 minutes, and you deliberate for too long and miss the movie, then you just indirectly chose not to go to the movie. Doesn't mean you have to go to the gym, but you certainly can't see that particular showing anymore. 

The quote actually explains it better, but I can't find it.

I've had this experience in a sort of different light before. The "urgent message" certainly has happened though.

		<description>This morning, I heard some voices giving me messages as well. But, it wasn't very clear. It was something similar to what you were talking about, to take action. But, before I went to sleep, I was thinking about leaving my body. All I remember after that was having a hallucination. 

I guess thats a little weird.</description>
