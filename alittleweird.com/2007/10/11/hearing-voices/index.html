				<p>Ah, hearing voices :-).  Is there anything more creepy and weirder than that :-P.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are psychotic people in the world who claim to hear voices, but are really just insane in the membrane.  I honestly don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m one of those people :-P.  But talking about voices in your head is a good way to get people to question your sanity, which can really spice up a conversation :-).</p>
<p>The types of experiences I have - I believe - are somewhat normal, just slightly more frequent and extreme.  Everyone hears a tiny voice in their head they call a conscience.  Everyone gets gut feelings.  Everyone has dreams.  When I talk about voices in my head, I&#8217;m talking about the same exact phenomenon - only more frequent, and more clear.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been putting emphasis on paying attention to my dreams.  I&#8217;ve been going to bed earlier (due to new work hours), and this has altered my dreaming experience.  I&#8217;m having longer lucid dreams, with different feels to them.  Nothing drastic&#8230; just a slightly different vibe.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m talking about all this is because this morning, I had a weird experience :-).  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had an experience quite like it in the past.  It wasn&#8217;t mind blowing, but it did strike me as interesting and unique.</p>
<p>I went to bed with a lot of life-problems on my mind, trying to sort them all out.  I tossed for about an hour and a half, just thinking about life.  When I finally went to bed, I had some cool lucid dreams, that consisted of flying around, and teaching my dream characters how to alter their dreams.  This is a common theme for my lucid dreams.</p>
<p>I woke up about 15 minutes before my alarm.  I came back slowly on purpose, playing around with my mental state, like I normally do.  I was fading in and out, and all of the sudden, a clear message started getting transmitted to me, out of the blue.  It started to form a dream, but I was on a border-line state, so the dream didn&#8217;t take hold.  The message repeated itself two or three times, and it felt like it was urgently trying to be sent to me before I woke up.</p>
<p>The message was basically that solutions arise from action.  I have a tendency to think about things too much (gee, ya think?), and over-analyze things.  Sometimes my thoughts paralyze me, and stop me from acting, because I don&#8217;t see any correct paths.  So I don&#8217;t take any path.  The message that repeated to me was basically: when there are no correct paths, just take action, and the correct path will reveal itself.  Then you can hop over to that path.  There&#8217;s no need to see the correct path before taking action.</p>
<p>Pretty basic lesson, which I&#8217;ve certainly learned and studied in the past.  But it was interesting to receive it in a border-line state of mind.  It felt like the message was coming from outside of myself, being urgently sent to me, and repeated on purpose.  Just to ensure I would get it before waking up.  I would like to think that there are &#8220;spirits&#8221; out there watching my back, and this definitely gives me that feel.  Maybe some day I&#8217;ll be able to figure out the validity of the experience.  Until that day arrives, it will have to be cataloged as: &#8220;Important message received from unknown source, by questionable means.&#8221; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>This morning, I heard some voices giving me messages as well. But, it wasn&#8217;t very clear. It was something similar to what you were talking about, to take action. But, before I went to sleep, I was thinking about leaving my body. All I remember after that was having a hallucination. </p>
<p>I guess thats a little weird.</p>

			<p>I forget the exact wording of this, but the idea was that eventually inaction makes the action for you. Example: If you&#8217;re unsure whether to go to the gym or to go go to a movie that&#8217;s playing in 20 minutes, and you deliberate for too long and miss the movie, then you just indirectly chose not to go to the movie. Doesn&#8217;t mean you have to go to the gym, but you certainly can&#8217;t see that particular showing anymore. </p>
<p>The quote actually explains it better, but I can&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this experience in a sort of different light before. The &#8220;urgent message&#8221; certainly has happened though.</p>

			<p>I was awoken by my little dog the other night, she whines when she&#8217;s thirsty or needs to go outside.  It usually takes a while for the whining to wake me, though I&#8217;m not sure how long since I&#8217;m barely conscious at best.</p>
<p>The last time she woke me, I had what I think was an acronym resonating in my mind.  It was either &#8220;T.C.F.&#8221; or &#8220;T.C.R.&#8221; or something like that.  I was aware of it when I woke up, but didn&#8217;t really understand.  I never thought it was something external, rather probably something subconscious, but it was definitely the first time I experienced something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe I was thinking &#8220;TFSU&#8221; directed at my dog <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve had similar things as well. Most of the time it&#8217;s a stream of thought that has nothing to do with what I&#8217;m currently thinking of, but it interjects loudly. The next thing I think is always: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that&#8230; or did I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The interjections seem much like a voice cutting in across my train of thought, but was it really another voice, or me? One thing is plain: it always affects me profoundly&#8230; for the time being.</p>
<p>Rarely will I actually hear voices, though. Mostly it&#8217;s (as your experience was) waking in the morning. Occasionally it&#8217;s when I&#8217;m getting dazey in the afternoons (melatonin spike!). <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
