		<description>Thats a good idea Antisankari =)

Last night I was able to make a very clear and visible psi ball with an electric charge, The lights in my room flickered for a moment and I think it might have something to do with the Psi Ball.

I am currently trying to learn a bit more about electrokinesis and umbrakinesis, but I suspect manipulating shadows must be very difficult and require an immense amount of concentration, I will however try to learn it =)</description>

		<description>Wow. This could end up extremely interesting. We would actually have some clue regarding the energy output of the psiballs.

Btw psimaster, If you want to just know the temperature, simply fetch an IR-thermometer. They are cheap and cheery. Cheapest go from low 50$ to high 200$. The camera would actually be able to "prove" theory behind constructs though.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the video, Its really cool.

I will try to get a thermal camera to see how much heat is emanated from making a Psi Ball. =)</description>

		<description>Well, Im actually at the moment in the university in faculty of science  buy its interesting to see how is it like in the other countries.

It seems like the lectures are lectures, no matter what country you are  in. =P</description>

		<description>Now I don't have to go to college!
I also now have a craving to go out and buy that thermal imaging camera.

Thanks for the vid.</description>
