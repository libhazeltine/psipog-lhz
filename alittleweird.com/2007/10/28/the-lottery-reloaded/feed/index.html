		<description>Don't try to participate with the lottery for too long. It increases your chances to actually win, even if it's a trivial gain.</description>

		<description>ClearVision forgets....Sean is super human!  I am rather curious as to how a feat like this could be put into an exact workable method.  Also ClearVision's comment got me thinking, if there are so many important intention controlled factors in the lottery winning process, could it be that you would have to consider each one of them while trying to manifest a win?  I mean, I know that there are many factors in even the smallest things that can be manifested by the method we have now, but could it be that other people's strong feelings going into the same event could change this?  That's honestly the only way I can get my head around it.</description>

		<description>well, yes. that is true. but it's pretty much impossible to throw exactly the same. especially if you only half know what you're doing.

even if you're trying to throw the same, there is always going to be some level of difference. and that may be what keeps it from going in. granted, there's nothing wrong with going for a completely different approach. fact, it "may" serve you a lot better. but that doesn't mean that the first way was wrong. or at least thats the way i see it. &#62;.&#62;


and i agree with ClearVision. i believe there are too many factors in the lottery that are beyond control (most notably every other person that wants to win)</description>

		<description>oh and about that "ball" comment : it can be done, but only because something changed, if you throw a ball from the exact same place with the exact same throw you'll fail.. unless you get lucky and the wind blows the right way.. 
but you have to change your pitch, and thats what i was getting at..</description>

		<description>Intention manifestation? False? I can't quite get there. I'm sure it still applies, however it is more complicated than simply believing in something. There are external factors, something that requires a look at the whole system. From both the perspectives of reality in general, and the involved parties in making the intention become reality. With the lottery, it's quite hard - there are tons of people involved - the people buying tickets, the managers, the people who sell the ticket, etc. You have to overcome all that. All of it. Somehow, your mind needs to find out/manipulate that system to get the right ticket. An extremely difficult task. 
And just because it's not working, you're taking the risk of throwing away a good model that just needs a bit of refinement? 
I think you just need some more people to help intend that you win. Alone, only a superhuman could accomplish this. It's a wonder you've actually won something after all.</description>

		<description>So does that mean you no longer believe in intention manifestation? (I'm so confused!) I thought the video of you winning some money on a lottery ticket helped prove its success.</description>

		<description>I remember that your earlier successes are made by utilizing your connection with your subconscious and basically sussing the winner out with your keen senses. Since I don't think I saw it fail you yet, maybe you can try that again.</description>

		<description>though, at the same time, just because a person fails at throwing a ball through a hoop doesn't mean it can't be done. *shrugs*</description>
