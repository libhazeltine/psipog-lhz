		<description>That sounds so fun.. Hmm Im not completely sure if it was an OBE but I have experienced that floating feeling several times while attempting to project but the only problem is I see only blackness. Am I doing things right? If so Im guessing OBE sight is an aqcuired ability just like the OBE itself... maybe?</description>

		<description>You're OBEs seem firmly set in reality. A lot of the writers on the subject go into very hard to believe - and even unsettling - things, like Monroe's confusing journeys related with some unfamiliar terms like Sector 8 and such. Have you ever had one like that?</description>
