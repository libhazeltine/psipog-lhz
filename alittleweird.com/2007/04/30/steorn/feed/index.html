		<description>I have been doing some reading on zero point energy, and I now consider it possible this device somehow "taps" into it. There are some great video's about it on google video.
By the way, you might find this interesting:

		<description>wow, 'twas just 3 days ago i was thinking about the possibility of using magnets to create free energy (coincidence?). i tossed about a few ideas on how it could actually be done, some of which seemed possible, but i didn't bother with it too much at the time.

still, it's nice to know others are working on such a thing. personally, i have good faith in this idea. i can't wait to see how this ends up ^-^</description>

		<description>If it's not a hoax, I (almost) can't believe it's a "true" perpetuum mobile, in the sense it creates more energy than you put into it. What is possible though (and that doesn't matter in practice as long as it works) it is some very clever way of using the earth magnetic field, or something along that line.</description>

		<description>A perpetual motion machine is pointless though unless the ouput force is greater then the used force by enough of an amount to create usable energy</description>

		<description>That would be pretty awesome. Steorn, the Orion quantum computer, we're in the middle of a technological revolution waiting to happen!</description>

		<description>Wow! This was interesting..
I bet the device is at the end something anyone can build in their home with couple of magnets and a metal ball :D</description>
