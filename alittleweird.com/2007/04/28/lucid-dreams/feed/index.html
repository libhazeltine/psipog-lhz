		<description>I lucid dreaming about one time per month... But I had 3 lucid dreams at July... And this month I had 3 lucid dreams too. I hope that all my dreams will be lucid soon. Besides, it's strange that I have lucid dreams when I forget to practise...
I remember dreams almost everyday... Dreams journal helped me to do so. I begun to write it at 2006 02 25... Then I could remember dreams only few times per month. Now I remember few dreams per day!</description>

		<description>I have been practicing lucid dreams for a while, and it works every now and then. I've actually been able to force myself to dream. Or, at least I think I am. It's always late at night and I'm tired. A lot of the times I don't remember my dreams, but everyone dreams EVERY time they go to sleep. You may or may not remember a dream, but you always do.</description>

		<description>i have been trying to have a lucid dream for almost a year now on and off and i have a dream log and have dreams that i can remember in detail every night. I also do several reality checks everyday that i can remember. I am still determined but and I guess i was wrong to think that just because i am a fast learner that this would be just like everything else in life and psionics but i was wrong and continue to practice</description>

		<description>I have the same thing going that Sean's friend did.  I sleep for about 3 hours a night and the rest is spent sitting there wishing I was asleep.  Luckily with a little focused will (and a cup of coffee) I'm still able to go from day to day on those 3 hours of sleep a night.  I try to go to bed the same time every night but I just can't make it work.  I can't remember having a dream since... well it's been a very long time.  I do daydream a lot though, does this affect how much my mind wanders at night?  Or maybe it's just stopping me from realizing I'm asleep at all since there is really no change.</description>

		<description>Let me clear up some of the things you guys have wrong.
First of all, everyone dreams, every night. The real thing you have to focus on is remembering dreams (or even getting a good night's sleep if you haven't gotten to that step). The best way to increase dream recall is with a dream journal as mentioned. Just remember dreams naturally. If you force it, you'll soon forget.
I've been trying to Lucid Dream since January, and I've only been purposely successful once: when I tried going to sleep with a trance induction mp3 playing. After a while I looked at the clock, then again, and the time had changed. It was a False Awakening!

I would recommend learning this skill to EVERYONE. It truly is amazing when you finally get it (especially if you're like me and have no skill to start with :P)</description>

		<description>To King Mickey and Freak Master (same person? :-P)...

Not sure.  I personally have never had trouble.  I've read a few different things to help.  One is to keep a dream journal - the point being to try and remember something... ANYTHING... once you wake up.  Write it down.  Over time, this will exercise your "dream memory", and it will get better.  My friend also had a problem with not dreaming... upon further investigation, I found out he only sleeps about 4 hours a night, and goes to sleep at random times.  My suggestion to him was to sleep at least 6 hours, preferable 7.5 hours, and do so on a schedule (i.e., always go to bed at the same time every night).  He said that helped him.</description>
