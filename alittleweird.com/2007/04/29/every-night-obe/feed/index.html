		<description>I doubt it that you leave your body every night. After all, just like you said, only the conscious mind leaves the body. The subconscious remains. If someone tries to "steal" your body by possessing it, your subconscious will be like a guard dog. Even if someone does possess your body, then you will be able to gain it back when they fall asleep, if they really do leave their body every night. I've come close to having an OBE 2 times  (I've tried twice :P) and I wonder how it feels to use psi while in OBE state.</description>

		<description>I've been practing OBE's for about a month now. I always feel like I'm almost out, but then I lose focus. When I try, my body starts twitching and I feel tingly all over. Is this the right feeling?</description>

		<description>I've seen this idea in a lot of places before. Robert Bruce is a supporter of it. Anyways, it seems reasonable to me, seeing as science is still stumped by most of sleep. We are obviously not controlling our body, and we are most certainly not dreaming the entire time. So where does our consciousness go? OBE's seem just as likely as anything else to me.

		<description>commenting on what sfg said:

maybe its a form of release or unwinding. some psychologists believe that you dream because your brain is actually trying to organize all the information you've learned throughout the day. maybe it has something to do with that. i don't know or have a personal opinion, but its just something to think about i guess.</description>

		<description>as with lucid dreams this is another thing i have been trying and maybe i should just focus more on one every night but anyways that made me think a lot and gave me a whole new perspective on the idea of sleep and OBE's. I look forward to futher entries to the site.</description>

		<description>Interesting, but if we all truly do leave our bodies at night, why? Why would we unconsciously be knocked out of our bodies? There has to be a reason. It's not like our subconscious mind just wants to have a little fun. ;)</description>

		<description>Very interesting concept. I'm trying to induce an OBE now for the purposes of browsing the Akashic Records and practicing PK. This should help me get even more motivated. Thanks Peebr- erm, Sean!</description>
