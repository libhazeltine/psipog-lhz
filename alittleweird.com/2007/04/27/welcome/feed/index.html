		<description>Hey Sean, it's good to see you're still out there, my friend. This is PantsParty- I decided to change my name to what I used to use. I'm glad there's something new now. I kept checking back here every 2 weeks or so, but was disappointed to find nothing. Thanks to somefatguy for letting me know it's up!

As always Sean I offer my full support for anything you may need. I've really had a spike in interest lately in dreaming and OBE's- I had my first lucid dream about 2 weeks ago and it was RIGHTEOUS. If you need to contact me, you can ALWAYS reach me at TerdFerguson07@hotmail.com. I'll be checking back here every day now.</description>
