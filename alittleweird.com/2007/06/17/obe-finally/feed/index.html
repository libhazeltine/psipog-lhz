		<description>I did try to have one, multiple times, except i feel like my eyes start focusing on my eyelids and it hurts them :(. However, it did feel like i was almost going into rem or something, because it looked like reality was going in + out + in + out over and over rapidly (i had my eyes closed, so not much reality to see). What do you recommend?</description>

		<description>Nice post Sean.
Thats a great story. I really do want to have OBE's, I just never seem to get to it (reading about them, practicing them, etc.). I'm hoping this summer will be a psionic summer :).

		<description>"I have no doubt that I’m more than my physical body, and that I’m going to survive the death of my body."

Aha, but remember what Monroe said in Journeys Out of the Body about this? To paraphrase: 

"Just because we are outside of our bodies does not mean that our body is not somehow responsible for the experience"

Essentially, an OBE might be something that the body produces, and is required to have an OBE. Granted I'm more in line with you, but OBE's aren't absolute proof for something completely independent of the body, just evidence.

		<description>"I would recommend everyone train for OBEs."

There are hundreds of techniques and methods out there, and everyone responds differently to each method - but just for interest's sake; how did you first learn to OBE? Did you find that some things really didn't work at all for you, or discover something that was a huge help?

I personally have never dedicated much time to OBEs though it's a huge interest for me anyway. I believe that I'm too grounded in reality and myself at the moment to pull it off though - it's hard for me to "get outside of" my physical body. I struggle even to imagine it. However, I want to work on them in the future at some point as I believe they can be a very valuable tool.</description>

		<description>I am delighted to hear that you once more had an OBE. I wish to give you a piece to think on:
According to Yoga science, philosophies and practices, astral projection is still a very surface level of reality. Beyond the astral level, there are more subtle experiences. 

They roughly state that there is the physical body, then there is the astral body, and that is where most websites and knowledge stops, since there are very few human beings that go beyond. But beyond the physical, emotional and astral, there is what they call the level of the causal body, and beyond, there is the level of the buddhic body. Then eventually, at the core of all bodies, there is Atman, the absolute center of the individual soul.

Maybe a suggestion Sean, to try and go beyond the astral. It may give you a motivation, or a new point of perspective, of focus. Something to experiement with and practice for.

Here is the technique how I understand it: You do exactly the same what you do when trying to AP, only difference is, that you apply it to yourself when in Astral. So don't go and look outward when AP-ing, instead, keep your focus one-pointed, keep it inside. Keep your mind completely empty, in focus, with the intention of moving your experience to the even subtler realms, bodies of your being. Try to pierce the astral with your consicousness so to say. 

I believe it is much like going in an elevator that's in the center of a building with multiple floors: You go in on ground level, you enter the elevator (meaning that you focus inside) then the elevator starts to rise and the doors open to a new level, this is the first floor (astral). You can choose to exit the elevator and explore the astral floor, but why not enter the elevator again, or stay in it in the first place. Let the doors to the astral open, but don't let that disturb your focus. Instead you keep focussed inside, you stay in the elevator. And then the elevator will rise again, to a higher floor. 

According to yoga science and to the people who practice this stuff or have practiced it, the second floor is called the causal realm/body. The third floor starts to become interesting to me, that is the body which is often identified as the direct expression from the human soul. It is called the Buddhic body. It fills you with absolute bliss and happiness. It is of a very subtle energy.

Move beyond that into the center of your soul itself, and enlightenment will be the result. This is according to my experience so far, my intuition and the ancient teachings of 'masters'.

I've been meaning to tell you this when I heard you were focussed on AP's alot and that you wanted to achieve instant AP-capabilities. There is more beyond the astral level. I personally make use of these levels without leaving my physical body. But it can be done in your way as well. Maybe it gives you a new perspective, hopefully.

		<description>I've been trying to have an OBE for a while, but I have problems making my head fall asleep, especially the are around my mouth, and for my body to fall completely asleep would take longer than the estimated 10-20 mins. Could someone tell me about some good relaxation methods please? I've tried counting backwards, but it didn't work to well.</description>

		<description>Well I a radom OBE A little over a year ago (Before I knew what they were), and it scared the hell outta me. But once I was able to figure out what happened I've been trying to do it again. Only been sucessful once so far. But I've had alot of periods when I was busy that I wans't reall trying. My problem now is that I can't keep the vibrations going when I finally do get them.</description>

		<description>Have you ever read "The Silva Mind Control Method" by Jose Silva.  He has some great methods for meditation.  I used them and would set my intention to get out of my body while in the alpha state.  It worked liked a charm.  Got so I would get up and realize I wasn't "really" awake and that I was out of my body.  Every night for a while.  Then I had to set my intention not to get out all the time.  If you have read it already, try using the active meditation. If you haven't get your hands on a copy and read it.  It is really great!</description>
