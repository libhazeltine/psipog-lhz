		<description>No...its not in your life according to the consequences and that's why the profit will never be too huge. Bottom line, you don't have what it takes in your life. To really win the Jackpot, you'll have to do a lot of things for others at no cost to make up for the fortune you will get, or else it wont happen because you did nothing to make up for it. 

You must understand that PK cannot help you to such a degree, because whatever is written in your life can not be easily altered. Otherwise all the huge winners would most likely to be masters at psionics. And all the psionic masters would just go Las Vegas to gamble and became billionaires at no effort.

No, reality is much more complicated, you must realize.

Sorry for being so dense, that is only what I believe, don't take my words for it because the reality could be something else, that will be a slap in my face though.</description>

		<description>I win every time too.  This time we did it again, another 2 dollar win.  And the time before that and the time before that.  Yet still no jackpot.  Do you think maybe we are blocking ourselves somehow.  Its very frustrating and it makes me mad and I get depressed about it.  Then I have to put all of this effort into getting happy about my present circumstances again. 

I wonder sometimes if we are approaching this the wrong way.  Maybe we need to concentrate on the dollar figure itself.  Silver Raven Wolf would say concentrate on the minimum you want and then visualize the amount plus more.  My magic number is 30 million cashout.</description>

		<description>hey Sean, I was reading your lucid dream you had, searching for answers to the lottery numbers.  I myself took this very same venture.. though regrettably in my upbringing I put myself into some situations.. so my dreams are much more macabre.  when I arrived in this Den, reminiscient of something seen in some poe fiction. I summoned my subc to me.  who is invariably a djinni, regardless to setting.  I requested to know how to win the lottery and he gave this advice.  "if you want your friend to win, tell him to dream of buying a random pick lotto ticket, it will give him a page of numbers (not a lottery guy, so i guess you get multiple rows?)  Once he has this, he can discern his winning lottery numbers from it" at this I forced out of lucidity and just said thanks

now, I'd also like to bring up, that my entire life, even into my childhood memories, I've sensed a creature, such as an imp or djinni and to look back at memories, there was always someone there.  in dreams when I call my subconcious it is this creature that shows up.  So presumably I've personified my subconcious into a state of manifestation, something I've done my entire life.  After reading further into it, it is kind of neat.

Back to my point, I used a lucid dream and my ever faithful subc so hopefully, I can help you get some result.  Please let me know your result, either here or through email.

Thanks</description>
