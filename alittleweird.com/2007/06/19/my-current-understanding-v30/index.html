				<p><em>READ: This is a huge post.  I&#8217;m sorry - I can&#8217;t help myself - my thoughts must move! I realize that most people probably won&#8217;t read it all - that&#8217;s fine, I don&#8217;t expect anyone to.  This post is more for my own documentation than it is to share my ideas with everyone.  In a future post, I will condense this down into a more readable format.  Until then, I need to document my thoughts before the next lottery drawing&#8230;</em></p>
<p>So anyways&#8230; I lost the lottery on June 15th, and it really pissed me off, and got me thinking.  Look - there&#8217;s an important lesson here that needs to be learned by the majority of people on this planet.  When you&#8217;re wrong, you&#8217;re wrong.  It&#8217;s not reality&#8217;s fault - it&#8217;s mine.  When your model of reality is incorrect, you DO NOT force reality to fit into your arbitrary mold.  You change your model, and learn from your mistakes.  That&#8217;s what this post is about.</p>
<p>I was wrong about intention manifestation.  I believe intention manifestation is a very nice model of reality, but there are some flaws, and these flaws are holding me back.  All models of reality have partial truths in them, so I must take what is true out of the intention manifestation model of reality, and create a new model that can help me win the lottery.</p>
<p>I was breaking the news to a friend of mine, and he responded that first I rejected randomness, and now I&#8217;m rejecting intention manifestation&#8230; what next?  Perhaps I enjoy rejecting models of reality a little too much :-).  Either way, I have an updated understanding (which will someday be replaced by yet another, I&#8217;m sure).  On to version 3.0&#8230;</p>
<p>The realization I made originated in my second lottery adventure, which <a href="../../../05/27/i-won-again/index.html">is documented in text and video</a>.  What sparked that experience was that I went to the store, and tried to <em>force</em> a win from the scratch off machine.  And I failed.  Being pissed, I decided to listen instead of forcing things, and documented one of my biggest wins on video as a result.</p>
<p>Where intention manifestation fails is that it gives you the sense that you can accomplish anything, as long as you believe it through and through.  This is false.  I hate to be a downer, and I hate to sound negative&#8230; but I have to conclude it&#8217;s false based on the evidence.  Belief can help by filtering and aligning your perspective on reality - but belief alone can not create.  All it does is change the filter, which can help you in finding opportunities, and things of that nature.  With an open belief system, your eyes are more open to success.  Belief is important - but belief alone does not do the creation.</p>
<p>Intention manifestation agrees with this mostly.  Intention manifestation states that you have to have belief, but you also have to have feelings - you have to visualize and feel as though your goal is true in this moment.  Intention manifestation states it&#8217;s more than just positive thinking&#8230; it&#8217;s more than just filtering your perspective.  Adding emotions into the mix, and really FEELING it, will produce results.  This is false.</p>
<p>Now you might jump out of your seat and yell - &#8220;Wait a second, you&#8217;ve been using intention manifestation to do all sorts of things, and you&#8217;ve gotten results!  How can you say that intention manifestation is false?!  You&#8217;ve used it and seen it with your own eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>True enough.  I have used intention manifestation to produce results that can&#8217;t be explained by simply altering your beliefs, and changing your filter.  On the surface, it seems as though intention manifestation is true, and that&#8217;s whats so tricky about it.  But we have to dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>The truth is that sometimes intentions come true, and sometimes they don&#8217;t.  The truth is that sometimes we go through all the steps, and it just doesn&#8217;t work.  Sometimes it does!  And it&#8217;s awesome!  But sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.  So obviously we&#8217;re missing something in the equation.  Some other factor that plays an important role, or some other understanding.</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven&#8217;t lost you just yet.  Let me review everything, from the beginning, to clear up what I&#8217;m about to do.</p>
<p>Ok.  So we have these models for reality.  Everyone has models for reality in their own minds&#8230; we might call them &#8220;belief systems&#8221;, or &#8220;the way things are&#8221;, or &#8220;how things work&#8221;, or &#8220;religion&#8221; &#8230; etc.  We all have an internal model of reality that we use in our minds.</p>
<p>Now there are some popular models that a lot of people share.  For example, the skeptical/cynical model of reality (version 1.0).  If I were to tell a skeptic that I plan on winning the lottery, they might respond that it is POSSIBLE for me to win&#8230; but in all likelihood, I won&#8217;t.  They might use concepts found in statistics and probability to talk about how the world works, and how the lottery is designed to make a profit for the government.  They might say that the lottery is the tax for the stupid.  Stuff like that.  This is all in their model of reality.  Now the skeptic usually has trouble telling the difference between actual reality, and the model of reality in their head.  They think they see reality perfectly clear, and usually have a hard time admitting that they just <em>might</em> be wrong.  They haven&#8217;t made the distinction that it&#8217;s simply a model in their own mind.  But that&#8217;s ok, we can forgive them for now.</p>
<p>In the New Age and Personal Development circles, we have the intention manifestation model of reality (version 2.0).  If I tell people who subscribe to this model that I plan on winning the lottery, most would probably cheer me on saying that it&#8217;s certainly possible if I do what intention manifestation tells me to do.  Some people might argue that because I&#8217;m getting &#8220;something for nothing&#8221;, that I will fail, because I don&#8217;t have a noble cause.  But most would probably admit that it&#8217;s possible.  They would tell me that I have to really <strong>believe</strong> that I can win, and that I have to meditate and visualize myself winning, and feel all the emotions associated with that.  Really put myself in the moment and feel like a winner.  Feel like I just won.  See it in my mind so clearly that it becomes superimposed on my subconscious mind, and transmitted out to the universe to attract it using &#8220;vibrations&#8221; and such.  Ok.</p>
<p>Now, those are just two models of reality.  Sure, they are each interesting in their own right, and they each have a body of literature and history.  They each have truths that can&#8217;t be denied.  But both of them are still just models of reality made by humans&#8230; they inherently have faults in them.  The trick is to separate yourself from the model you hold in your mind.  Don&#8217;t become attached to the model - become attached to reality.  Reality is the judge.  Not the model in your mind.  Reality determines what is possible, and what isn&#8217;t possible.  Not your human understanding.  So we must constantly evolve our own internal models based on what we observe in reality.  We might not be able to create a 100% perfect model, but that&#8217;s ok.  We just need to be flexible enough to modify our model when the situation calls for it.  We need to be willing to change.</p>
<p>So&#8230; my interest in the lottery was sparked by internalizing the realization that the skeptical/cynical model of reality (version 1.0, dealing with probability and statistics) isn&#8217;t entirely true.  There is a vital flaw in this model.  I outline the flaw in three posts on this website, <a href="../../../05/19/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-1/index.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="../../../05/21/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-2/index.html">Part 2</a>, and <a href="../../../05/23/randomness-doesnt-exist-part-3/index.html">Part 3</a>.  If you don&#8217;t want to read all those, I will summarize the flaw briefly here.</p>
<p>The flaw with the skeptical/cynical model of reality is that it can&#8217;t explain how people win the lottery twice.  It simply can&#8217;t.  Now, if you think that it can explain it, then I encourage you to take classes in probability and statistics to truly understand what our modern views of reality tell us about someone winning the lottery twice.  If you grasp probability and statistics correctly, then there is only one conclusion to make: people should never win the lottery twice.  Yet, people do.  So we must admit that the skeptical/cynical model is incorrect.</p>
<p>Now we reach another crossroad.  Reality is not behaving as the intention manifestation model states that it should.  Just like reality doesn&#8217;t behave like the skeptical/cynical model says it should.  What is our response?  Modify our model of reality.  We are forced to reject intention manifestation, the same way we were forced to reject modern ideas of probability and statistics.</p>
<p>When we rejected probability and statistics, we didn&#8217;t reject everything.  We can&#8217;t.  A lot of probability and statistics is completely correct and accurate!  I would say probably 99% of it :-).  But there is a vital flaw.  Probability and statistics rely on the existence of the concept of randomness.  However, it is my understanding that randomness does not exist.  Therefore, while probability and statistics are great tools, we have to realize what they are doing.  They are not modeling random numbers.  They are modeling choice.  Making that simple correction does not undermine all the work that&#8217;s gone into the fields of probability and statistics.  It simply tweaks it slightly to more accurately fit reality - and it works.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re rejecting intention manifestation, we have to realize that a lot of intention manifestation is completely correct.  But we need to tweak again.  We need to observe reality, and realize where the holes are in our model.  Then we need to patch the holes, and use this modified model of reality to accomplish our goals.  If reality throws experiences at us that contradict our modified model (which will certainly happen at some point), then we will be forced to tweak again.</p>
<p>So - where does intention manifestation fail?</p>
<p>It fails when we try to manifest something, following the instructions correctly, and it doesn&#8217;t work.  Our goal isn&#8217;t accomplished.  We experienced the feelings, we did the visualization, we focused, felt good, believed&#8230; and then nothing.  No results.  Instead of beating ourselves up, let&#8217;s beat up intention manifestation :-).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try to understand how humans created intention manifestation to begin with.  We were pretty smart about it&#8230; What we did was go around, and interview and talk to all these successful people.  We asked them, &#8220;How did you do it?  What is your story?  What made you succeed where everyone else failed?&#8221;  This is a great idea!  Asking questions is a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Successful people responded with their stories.  And a lot of these stories had things in common.  So, being the smart human race that we are, we looked at the patterns.  We noticed that a lot of successful people had a burning desire to succeed.  And this desire consumed their thoughts.  We noticed that a lot of successful people believed they would succeed before they did - even when they logically shouldn&#8217;t have believed it.  We noticed that this burning desire and belief were the very things that made them succeed.  Story after story, we noticed that it was this burning desire and belief that got these people through the tough times, and allowed them to create opportunities for them, that led to success.  Amazing!</p>
<p>So, after we noticed this, we proclaimed: Successful people had a burning desire and unwavering belief before they were successful.  If you want to be successful, you need a burning desire and unwavering belief.  Tada!</p>
<p>This idea is outlined in hundreds of books, the most popular of which is undoubtedly Napoleon Hill&#8217;s, <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-3226097-7024607?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=think+and+grow+rich&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go"><em>Think and Grow Rich</em></a>, published in 1937.  A lot of books influenced the creation of the intention manifestation model of reality, but it is my opinion that this book is one of the major ones.</p>
<p>Over time, the intention manifestation model has evolved into what we see presented today, by programs like &#8220;<a href="http://thesecret.tv/">The Secret</a>&#8220;, and all the other ripoffs.  It has evolved from this idea of burning desire and belief, into visualization and feeling your goal is already achieved.</p>
<p>So where is the mistake?  Where is the flaw?</p>
<p>I will tell you.  It&#8217;s very clear to me now that I have hindsight.  The flaw is that we think belief, expectation, and feelings <em>cause</em> our goal to be accomplished.  This is incorrect.</p>
<p>This is the mistake that we made.  We saw that successful people have strong beliefs, and having this sense of &#8220;knowing&#8221; that they would succeed, before they actually succeeded.  This sense of &#8220;knowing&#8221; is very important - and anyone who has applied intention manifestation knows specifically what it is.  This sense of simply knowing that your goal WILL be accomplished.  You just know.  The mistake that we made is thinking that this sense of knowing <em>caused</em> the goal to be accomplished.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually a pretty normal mistake that we make all the time.  The cynics have solved this problem already for us (hey, what can I say, I owe you a beer :-P).  It&#8217;s a logical fallacy, called <a href="http://skepdic.com/posthoc.html">Post Hoc</a>.  We noticed that this sense of knowing came before the success, so we assumed this sense of knowing caused the success.  Incorrect.  Just because it came before does not mean that it caused it.</p>
<p>Our techniques for intention manifestation are based on the idea that we need to induce this sense of knowing.  We need to alter our beliefs.  We need to create a burning desire.  We need to make ourselves believe.  We need to convince ourselves that our goal is accomplished.  Once we do that, we will have our sense of knowing.  And once we have this sense of knowing, then success will follow.</p>
<p>But now we have to reconcile the fact that people can brainwash a sense of knowing in themselves, and the goal still isn&#8217;t accomplished.  How do you reconcile that?  All you intention manifestation people out there reading this&#8230; how do you explain how a person can believe 100%, feel it, visualize it, get into it&#8230; and then fail?  You can&#8217;t.  Not with the intention manifestation model.  It&#8217;s time for a new model.</p>
<p>We run into some tension here, because some people might fear that if intention manifestation is incorrect, then we must downgrade to the skeptical/cynical model of reality.  Hey, don&#8217;t beat yourself up too bad.  We don&#8217;t have to move in that direction.  We can create a new model that incorporates everything we&#8217;ve learned.  And since our new model is going to be based on personal experience and open mindedness, we&#8217;ll be sure to include everything we possibly can, which will in turn help us to accomplish our goals even faster than before.</p>
<p>So now that we know the history of all this bullshit, what is our new model going to be?  I propose version 3.0, the choice model :-).  Please be aware that I didn&#8217;t come up with this all on my own.  My current understanding is a result of reading, experimenting, discussing, and stealing ideas from other smart people (one good location for that is <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/intention-manifestation/">Steve&#8217;s forum on intention manifestation</a>).</p>
<p>(This is a long post, I&#8217;m sorry.  I want to get this down on paper before the next lottery drawing, even if that means no one will read the entire post :-P.)</p>
<p>My current understanding is that choice is the root to achieving a goal.  This choice is made before the goal is actually manifested, ranging anywhere from a few microseconds, to decades.  When this choice is made, we feel a sense of knowing that the goal will be accomplished.  Perhaps this sense of knowing comes from a precognitive facility in our minds that actually sees the goal being accomplished - I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>What I want to point out is that this choice has a supernatural quality about it that creates the reality we will someday experience.  This isn&#8217;t simply a normal decision that we experience all the time&#8230; this choice is on a different level.  English doesn&#8217;t have the vocabulary for it.</p>
<p>Ok, look.  This isn&#8217;t your normal decision.  I&#8217;m not sure if I can explain it to someone whose never made a decision like this before.  To people who have used intention manifestation, you&#8217;ve already done it, and you can probably understand what I&#8217;m getting at.  There comes a point when you say to yourself, &#8220;I AM going to do this.  Period.&#8221;  And that sentence alone isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s so powerful about it.  It&#8217;s all the emotion&#8230; it&#8217;s every cell in your body saying &#8220;YES&#8221; to this.  It is a true decision, a real choice.  Not the wishy-washy crap that we do daily.  It&#8217;s the type of choice that makes you slam your fist down on the table, stand up tall, and stare reality in it&#8217;s eye.  It&#8217;s not anger, it&#8217;s not fear, it&#8217;s not happiness, it&#8217;s not joyfulness.  It&#8217;s the raw emotion of &#8220;am&#8221;.  &#8220;To be&#8221;.  I AM going to do this.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the power is.  It&#8217;s not about good or bad, or noble, or evil.  It&#8217;s raw &#8220;YES&#8221;.  It&#8217;s raw &#8220;GO&#8221;.  This is the emotion that is the root to the burning desire.  This is the emotion that is the root to belief.  To the sense of knowing.  This emotion - this choice - is the origin.  Maybe you&#8217;ve never made a decision like this before, but you&#8217;ve probably seen someone make this decision.  To look in their eye, and see their resolve.  It&#8217;s almost like their decision convinces you.  You don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re going to accomplish their goal, but just by looking at them you know they are going to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not stubbornness, though it might look a little similar.  It&#8217;s different.  Stubbornness is forceful in nature&#8230; this type of decision that I&#8217;m describing really isn&#8217;t forceful.  It&#8217;s self-evident.  It&#8217;s true because it&#8217;s true.  Stubbornness shuts down your mind&#8230; this type of decision opens your mind up.  That&#8217;s one way to tell the difference.</p>
<p>When you make a decision like this, the world moves.  Shit that&#8217;s in your way gets out of your way.  Shit you need to experience starts to bee-line in your direction.</p>
<p>Now - there are different degrees, which is important to realize.  It&#8217;s not all about emotion, even though that&#8217;s the picture I painted above.  Emotion does help though.  We can throw all the emotion out the window, and still be left with this choice.  However, if you want to make the choice consciously, it would probably be in your best interest to use emotion to help you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about existence.  It&#8217;s about being.  It&#8217;s not inducing a sense of knowing&#8230; it&#8217;s behind that.  Once you hit it, you feel a sense of knowing.  Don&#8217;t identify it as the sense of knowing - that&#8217;s where intention manifestation made it&#8217;s mistake.  It&#8217;s behind the sense of knowing.  It&#8217;s the root.</p>
<p>Intention manifestation points us in the right direction, which is why it&#8217;s successful.  But it fails because it&#8217;s not precise.  It gets us in the right area, but it misses the exact location.  We may stumble upon the exact location while using intention manifestation, but only because it&#8217;s in such close proximity.  These are the times when we succeed.  Other times, we are still in the same ballpark, but we fail because we didn&#8217;t precisely hit where we need to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m explaining it correctly.  Sometimes my mind gets carried away&#8230; let me try again :-P.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is a choice.  Wash away the extra bullshit, and you&#8217;re left with a choice.  Now, in reality, we have a real hard time washing away the extra bullshit :-P.  So we have to deal with the bullshit instead.  That&#8217;s where things start getting hard to understand.  Everyone has different stuff piled on their consciousness, so we all have different things to deal with when it comes to making this choice.  It&#8217;s tough to get through and make the choice, because there&#8217;s so much crap.  That&#8217;s why we have techniques, methods, exercises, models, ideas, discussions, growth, etc.</p>
<p>Look, if you believe that you can&#8217;t win the lottery, then that is extra bullshit piled on your consciousness that needs to be dealt with before you can win the lottery.  But it&#8217;s not even that simple.  If that&#8217;s all you had to deal with, then that would be easy!  In reality, we have miles of shit to wade through.  A simple belief that you can&#8217;t win is just an ounce.</p>
<p>Here, let me draw a picture:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/06/bullshit.png" alt="Bullshit" /></p>
<p>Alrighty! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>All hope is not lost&#8230; yet :-P.</p>
<p>My point is that we have a lot of stuff that goes on inside of our head that stops us from making these powerful choices all the time.  The intention manifestation model does a pretty good job of cutting through a lot of that shit, but it&#8217;s not good enough.  We can accomplish a lot of wonderful things with intention manifestation, but it falls short when it comes to winning the lottery.  We <em>might</em> be able to use intention manifestation to win the lottery, but there is a better way.</p>
<p>I failed to win the lottery this past time because I focused on inducing a sense of knowing, assuming that it was the sense of knowing that created the success.  This is false, hence I failed.</p>
<p>Now that I see that this supernatural choice is my goal, I know where to aim.  And I&#8217;ll know when I get it, because I&#8217;ll feel a sense of knowing.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah blah blah.</p>
<p>What does it all mean?!</p>
<p>It means I&#8217;m changing my strategy for picking lottery numbers.  In the past, I just picked random numbers while filling out the lottery sheet.  This method may produce a win, but I want to be smarter about it.  My new method is to write down lottery numbers on paper, and examine my &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; about them.  Then tweak the numbers over and over again, until I find my maximum &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221;.  Then play those numbers.</p>
<p>This &#8220;sense of knowing&#8221; is something that needs to be polled.  It needs to be examined and used.  NOT FORCED.  Not induced.  It&#8217;s already in us, so let&#8217;s <em>use</em> it!  I&#8217;m much more confident with this strategy than my strategy in the past, and it feels much more correct.</p>
<p>We shall see where it leads.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, amazing.  I really didn&#8217;t expect anyone to read this entire post.  You must be bored :-).  Like I said at the start, I intend on making a much more smaller version of this post in the future.  I simply didn&#8217;t have the time, and I wanted to get my ideas out before the next lottery drawing.  If you&#8217;ve skipped to the end, then you&#8217;re a lousy cheater! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  JERK! :-P.  Anyways&#8230; this post took three days to write.  And my thoughts are still bouncing around.  They will eventually settle down.  Thanks!  See ya.</p>

			<p>Ok read it. Nice piece of Text there Sean.</p>
<p>I have some good ammount of experience with the intention manifestation and I have some good ammount of experience with personal and spiritual development. I have read your ideas and I understand them very well. I had the same thoughts about the intention manifestation phenomena. However, I think you discard the idea of intention manifestation too briefly. You see, there are flaws, but they are not in the intention manifestation itself. The flaws exist in the explanation given by people who preach this principle of attraction. They either don&#8217;t know everything or they won&#8217;t tell you.</p>
<p>So basically, what you were saying is, the intention manifestation phenomenon is flawed, because when I follow the exact instructions: Feel my intention; belief I already have it; and visualize it with all my senses every day, I don&#8217;t get exactly what I want. So it is flawed.</p>
<p>Well no, I disagree. It is not flawed. What is flawed, is you. Or me, or anyone using the principle of attraction. What you said about the bullshit that is in between us and the conscious choice/intention manifestation comes close to what I believe to be the flaw. You see, you can visualize all you want, you can try to feel it all you want, you can use all the rules you like, apply them to your image, your intention&#8230; but it won&#8217;t do you any good if your subconscious mind is not in line with what you want. You can pretend to believe it to the point of actually consciously believing it&#8230; But still there is the subconscious doubt, which is beyond your conscious mental experience at that moment. You have convinced yourself now that you believe it, but you have only pulled up a new cover. Underneath there is tons of doubt, fear and distrust. Because we have conditioned ourselves for many many years. our minds are shaped into certain patterns, certain models. It is not about adjusting the contents, it is about adjusting or annihilating the structure of these models that bring forth the content.</p>
<p>You may want something, but if your subconscious disagrees, you are not going to get it. You will need effective techniques to rastically change your entire emotional/mental structure (http://www.yoga-mind-control.com/the-mind-structure.html). Your subconscious mind has to be congruent for the full 100% with your conscious intention, or else it wont work at all, or maybe just a little. </p>
<p>This is important to realize: You will get exactly as much as is acceptable to your subconscious mind. It is not only about communicating with the subconsicous, it is about re-shaping its entire structure, or even better: destroy or transcend all structure&#8230; but this is a difficult task. If you manage to accomplish the latter, you are free from the mind&#8217;s bondage and everything you intend, WILL happen. The principle itself is completely flawless, I am absolutely certain of that. The flaw is our own mind, as it is the flaw in everything. It is the obstacle for everything we want to be.</p>
<p>You said:<br />
&#8220;Don’t become attached to the model - become attached to reality. Reality is the judge. Not the model in your mind. Reality determines what is possible, and what isn’t possible. Not your human understanding. So we must constantly evolve our own internal models based on what we observe in reality. We might not be able to create a 100% perfect model, but that’s ok. We just need to be flexible enough to modify our model when the situation calls for it. We need to be willing to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>-There are some contradictions in this piece of text that shows bondage to the mind. You say Not to be attached to your mental model, but to let reality be the judge. But reality does not judge, only the mind judges. Reality does not determine, it is the field of teh subconscious mind that determines. So in this perspective of what you call reality, you are basically still within the mind, for there is judgement, there is a model. Perhaps in a more conscious level, but still in the mind. Also, we should not bother about creating a better model, we should try to move beyond all models. And stay that way! The latter is the tricky part, but staying beyond all models, beyond the mind, will gradually and relatively fast, dissolve all structure and models that has formed in your mind due to past experience. Time will cease, models will die, and you and your intentions will be free.. </p>
<p>Now the principle will be perfect, because you are now perfect.</p>

			<p>From the way I understood this, what you wrote reminds me of what Joe Vitale wrote in his book The Attractor Factor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s step 3 of his 5 step process to intention manifestation. He calls this step &#8220;Getting Clear.&#8221; basically you make sure that all of you wants your goal and is in alignment, and there&#8217;s no emotional or mental blocks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;it won’t do you any good if your subconscious mind is not in line with what you want&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree&#8230; somewhat.  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree.  It is true.  There is a problem though.  What if my subconscious mind is 100% in line, and my goal still doesn&#8217;t manifest?  Is that a possibility in your model?</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re both talking about the same thing, just from a different angle.  My complaint about intention manifestation is that they claim that feelings will create success.  I disagree with this idea.  They claim the feelings will send out vibrations that attract your goal.  I disagree.  There are no vibrations, and you don&#8217;t need feelings.</p>
<p>The only reason intention manifestation succeeds is because it&#8217;s in the right ballpark of what&#8217;s really going on.  What we need to do is get that choice, and then the feelings will flow naturally from that choice.  We don&#8217;t need to induce the feelings by force.  But we can use the existence of the feelings to see if we have made the choice, if we notice the feelings flowing through us freely.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m so glad people are starting to realize that &#8220;The Secret&#8221; is watered-down shit. </p>
<p>You can visualize and think positive thoughts all you want and sure it will work some of the time and maybe even a lot of the time but like you said peebrain its missing the big picture. </p>
<p>If your intentions are not aligned with your beliefs it not going to work. You can intention and intention but its not going to work if you have a conflicting belief. </p>
<p>The powerful choice that peebrain is describing is the act of changing your beliefs or inserting a belief that is less limiting.</p>
<p>In life fear and doubt is what holds you back, stunting your will to act. Your beliefs are manifested faithfully and your experience becomes limited. You have to rid yourself of those beliefs (or strong ideas about reality, btw reailty is ideas). </p>
<p>When you release internal resistance intentions manifest much easier.</p>

			<p>He will take the money and make his life happier.  Which is exactly what I will do.   This whole concept of manifestation is used in witchcraft.  I&#8217;ve been using it for years and never really knew what it was called. When performing a spell we visualize the results.  Without that the &#8220;magic&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work. </p>
<p>I think maybe you are trying to speed things up a little to much.  Its been explained to me that &#8220;the universe&#8221; works on &#8220;universal time&#8221;.  Our thoughts, dreams, desires and all the rest do cause changes in this universe but our concept of time is not on a universal scale.  A day for the universe is like the blinking of an eye for us.</p>
<p>I can raise my hands and face west and mentally summon a thunderstorm when these mountains need rain and within 3 days I will have my storm, but it usually takes three days.  I don&#8217;t just snap my fingers and create it.  Now I have had my moments, lol.  I have raised my hands and summoned rain and the thunderhead directly over me will rain on me for a minute or two, but it takes a little while for the real rain to get here.  This is just an example.  By the way if you have never done that you may want to give it a shot. Its really cool :).  My little section of the Ozarks has not had a drought in years!!!!</p>
<p>Some other examples.  I wanted a house in the country.  It took six months to find one but I got it.  Maybe you just need to allow more time for the energy to manifest itself in the right direction.</p>

<p>No, cause then your subconscious mind is not 100% in line with your intention. That&#8217;s the only reason for the lack of manifestation. We might think we are completely in line with our intention, but if it doesn&#8217;t manifest, there is some subconscious/emotional/mental obstacle in our self.</p>
<p>Induced feelings don&#8217;t create any substantial succes I agree unless you are truly good at it. And even then, if you are very out of line with your subconscious, it will have little effect on the physical world.</p>

We might think we are completely in line with our intention, but if it doesn’t manifest, there is some subconscious/emotional/mental obstacle in our self.&#8221;</p>
<p>You could argue this point all day long, but basically since you don&#8217;t have anything to measure how much your subsconscious is &#8220;in line&#8221; with your intention, you can not say whether it is or not when your intention manifests. Now sure you can say, &#8220;Well isn&#8217;t it only logical, that something would only manifest if you believed 100% consciously and subconsciously?&#8221; But of course there are many cases where people will say they weren&#8217;t sure if it was all going to work out in the end, but it still ended up working out. Now as I said before you can&#8217;t measure, but if you can go off logic, than I can too, and wouldn&#8217;t it seem logical that if someone wasn&#8217;t sure it would even work out in the end, that they had some sort of doubt, and their subconscious was not 100% in line? I think so.</p>
<p>So while you can argue it all day long, until you can actually show some sort of proof that things don&#8217;t work out in the end until you fully believe them, than the arguement is kinda pointless. And as I said before, there are plenty of cases saying otherwise.</p>

			<p>Proof for that is everywhere IMO. Your entire life is hard evidence for this principle of your subconscious being in line with you.</p>
<p>You said:<br />
&#8220;You could argue this point all day long, but basically since you don’t have anything to measure how much your subsconscious is “in line” with your intention, you can not say whether it is or not when your intention manifests.&#8221;</p>
<p>-The measure device you have, is the quality of your manifestations in life. If the manifestation sucks or there doesn&#8217;t seem to be one at all, you got a perfect reflection of how well your cubsconscious mind is in line with what you consciously want; appaerently it doesn&#8217;t agree with you in such cases.</p>
<p>You also said: &#8220;So while you can argue it all day long, until you can actually show some sort of proof that things don’t work out in the end until you fully believe them, than the arguement is kinda pointless.&#8221;</p>
<p>-My proof is the fact that when I do feel that I consciously and subconsciously believe something can and will happen for me, it does.</p>
<p>I know for 100% sure right now that I am going to move my arm up and down a bit. * Moves away from keyboard to move arm up and down a bit* &#8230; There was my proof, right there. My subconscious mind believes that i can do it, I consciously know that I can do it, so all that I needed now was the intention and the will to bring forth the manifestation. You may say that this is something entirely else of an example than manifesting for example winning the lottery, but if you say so, it is only in your mind that there is a difference between moving an arm up and down and winning the lottery. In reality, there is non. Reality does not judge, it does not calculate which intention is more difficult, or bigger&#8230; That difference exists only in the mind. Hence: You will be able to move your arm up and down and you won&#8217;t be able to win the lottery: simply because you believe those two things require something entirely else, or much more power, or whatever you may think.</p>
<p>The thing is, everything that happens is a manifestation and non of them are more difficult or &#8216;bigger&#8217; than other manifestations. Every manifestation comes from the same dance of energy, there is no substantial difference but your mindset! Proof is everywhere, your life is your proof. Your life is your perfect mirror.</p>

			<p>I didn&#8217;t really bother to read all of these comments&#8230; there are too many of them. But I read in the one right above mine the thing about your arm having to do with conscious / subconscious action. </p>
<p>I think it brings up an interesting point. Intending to move your arm does absolutely nothing. I can sit here all day and think &#8220;Darn, it sure would be nice to move my arm.&#8221; And nothing would happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I could actually move my arm. And it would move.</p>
<p>I think the problem with all of this is that we try to use our conscious thought processes to change things. The part of your mind that you think with is more like a diary. It thinks about things and writes them down and thinks about how nice things would be. You need to find some part of yourself that is actually able to make these things happen. </p>
<p>From previous experiences many of us are convinced that it must exist / be possible. The problem then becomes figuring out how exactly to control that process in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>right?</p>

			<p>War1025, i agree with you so much. That was the only method that worked for me 100% of the time (for psychokinesis) and felt like it was still draining me if i didnt have much energy (tired, 11:00 and all i wanna do is sleep <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> ).</p>
<p>Sean, i also agree with that &#8220;choice&#8221;, and it goes for everything in life, not just psionics. When i get up on the blocks (swimming), and i really want to win deep down&#8230; I&#8217;m warming up by the blocks, loosening up, and something just clicks (its more of a snap type think, think of a light-switch), where i go &#8220;I <i>will</i> win this race. I <i>will</i> go a best time,&#8221;. And then things just go the way i know they will.</p>

			<p>Sean: Should not be a big deal no, although I have no such intention. There is doubt in my mind as well on various areas, and I didnt claim any achievement in specific, but I have had my share of proof to know that for me it always works for the perfect 100% when all levels of my being are congruent, aligned. My contribution was only to say that in my experience the principle itself, works perfectly fine. Its just the polluted and scattered mind that is not capable of using that perfection. </p>
<p>So I would suggest not to discard the principle or suggest it is flawed; that is a hasty misassumption in my experience. The law is pure; we are not. Hence the lack of results. There is no blaim on the outside world, or on &#8216;reality&#8217;, or on the law of attraction, or on the secret. They are not incorrect per se; the teachings are often incomplete, but the law they refer to is pure and flawless. Again: in my experience/opinion.</p>

			<p>In response to war1025:</p>
<p>Yes, it was harder reading all the comments than reading the whole post. But beyond that. I agree with you completely. A personal experience: Last month I was trying to teach myself to wiggle my ears. (Silly, I know, but I was procrastinating for my AP exams.) I read every article on WikiHow.com but nothing helped. One day I was just sitting around, thinking about something else, when I made a certain face and I finally &#8211;felt&#8211; the muscle I was suppose to use.</p>
<p>The point of this far-fetched metaphor: sometimes things just &#8216;click&#8217; and you need to &#8211;learn&#8211; how to &#8216;just do it.&#8217; </p>
<p>In response to Sean:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my opinion that change is good and natural. Even changing viewpoints keep our minds flexible, that is, until you learn to abolish all structure, but I&#8217;ve never met anyone who&#8217;s accomplished that.</p>

			<p>The post I ended up typing in response to the responses to my post were longer than I wanted to post(as usual). So I&#8217;m just going to say : If it works for you go with it, don&#8217;t expect though because you feel that it is right you, that it will be right for everyone else(yes, as peebs has said before). Feeling the need to convince others of the correctness of what you believe only shows you don&#8217;t fully believe in it enough yourself, and you need others to fill that lack of belief for you. With that said, I think it is clear that I don&#8217;t believe the way you do, and I&#8217;m not simply going to take it into consideration just because one guy on the internet says he believes in it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Feeling the need to convince others of the correctness of what you believe only shows you don’t fully believe in it enough yourself, and you need others to fill that lack of belief for you.&#8221; &#8212; Oneta</p>
<p>Belief, at least as I understand it, is by definition something that is not certain.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in ghosts. I believe you are telling the truth. etc.</p>
<p>In each of these statements there is no direct proof of truth. There is room for doubt. That is what makes them &#8220;beliefs.&#8221; </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that I am 18 years old. I know that I am. It is a quantifiable, provable fact.</p>
<p>Knowing things is great as far as certain things are concerned. But sometimes its better to just  believe. Belief, in my mind, means that you are still searching. You are still trying to find solid ground. As soon as you *know* something, it ceases to change. You are no longer accepting alternate possibilities.</p>
<p>And that is what we are trying to do here, we are trying to find something to *believe* with a greater degree of certainty. We still don&#8217;t really know anything for certain, but we would really like to get closer to that end.</p>
<p>So, this isn&#8217;t so much everyone trying to get others to believe what they do, but us simply laying our cards out on the table and asking each other &#8220;What among this is plausible?&#8221; No, I don&#8217;t fully believe any of this. I am uncertain, I have doubts. I&#8217;m just searching for something to put some faith into.</p>

			<p>Heh. I didn&#8217;t really say anything about what belief is, or anything of the sort. I just brought up the fact of not fully believing in your own beliefs enough. Just because a belief is something you are uncertain of being real, doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have enough faith in it to not care what others think on the subject. Any time I talk to my friend about such matters on Religion, this is what he tells me : &#8220;I&#8217;m open minded on what others believe, but closed on what I believe.&#8221; Which is basically his way of saying &#8220;You can talk all you want, I don&#8217;t care either way.&#8221; The fact of saying that everyone is just here to slap ideas on the table just for the fun of it, or even to come up with something solid to believe in, well it just verifies what I said to begin with. It shows that you don&#8217;t feel what you currently believe is accurate enough. Therefore you don&#8217;t fully believe in it. If you did fully believe in it, then that is where you would end it, and you wouldn&#8217;t need any more ideas to complete it, because you&#8217;d feel it was complete as is. </p>
<p>As for if you are here to just share perspectives..what is the point?  To show how you believe in this, not that it matters, because so and so believes in this? Anyways this is not the case. We have peebs posting his thoughts and beliefs, and then people who support Intention manifestation telling him not to give up just yet on the idea. Sounds like a bit more than just sharing perspective. A conversation of shared perspectives would go like this</p>
<p>Tom: Hey bob, you know&#8230;I&#8217;ve been eating a lot of string cheese lately, and I just don&#8217;t think I enjoy the taste of it anymore.<br />
Bob: That&#8217;s cool, Tom, personally I enjoy string cheese myself on Ritz crackers.<br />
Tom: Yeah, me too, that&#8217;s always been good for an easy snack when I&#8217;m too lazy to fix something.</p>
<p>Not this:</p>
<p>Tom: Hey bob, you know&#8230;I&#8217;ve been eating a lot of string cheese lately, and I just don&#8217;t think I enjoy the taste of it anymore.<br />
Bob: Well that is strange, string cheese is so awesome, you shouldn&#8217;t give up on it just yet, maybe your taste buds are just odd right now, because string cheese taste awesome to me, so it must be something wrong on your side.<br />
Tom: Yeah, well what about Onions, I like them, and you don&#8217;t, so maybe your taste buds are the ones that are a bit off!</p>
<p>Examples of the following conversation from this part of the blog:<br />
&#8220;However, I think you discard the idea of intention manifestation too briefly. You see, there are flaws, but they are not in the intention manifestation itself. The flaws exist in the explanation given by people who preach this principle of attraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, cause then your subconscious mind is not 100% in line with your intention. That’s the only reason for the lack of manifestation. We might think we are completely in line with our intention, but if it doesn’t manifest, there is some subconscious/emotional/mental obstacle in our self.&#8221; (said in response to Peebs implying that the problem here for sure was that things were not in line 100%, yet has no way of verification.)</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some contradictions in this piece of text that shows bondage to the mind. You say Not to be attached to your mental model, but to let reality be the judge. But reality does not judge, only the mind judges.&#8221;(This was said in response to a quote of Peebs)</p>
<p>Then I chime in with the &#8220;you can argue all day&#8221; comment. Which I don&#8217;t find to imposing, just trying to get some realization that arguements could seem valid from both points of view, depending on how you approach it. But apparently it was imposing, because it provoked a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I would suggest not to discard the principle or suggest it is flawed; that is a hasty misassumption in my experience. The law is pure; we are not. Hence the lack of results.&#8221;(sure you say in your experience, but anything anyone says is from their experience, you can&#8217;t experience something for someone else.)</p>
<p>Other similar things were said, but these were just the best examples and mainly because it is coming from the same one who was saying we are just sharing perspectives. To share perspectives is not to tell each other what we think they are doing wrong, or what we think they should do. Even if you present such as opinions, it is still debating. And in debates you try and convince others that what you are saying is right, and the other party is wrong.</p>

			<p>Well I read the entire piece and my motives were not boredom. Though my journey started with your claim &#8220;randomness does not exists&#8221; I find it ironic the closer you get to your goal the more randomness (by definition) plays into your explanations. This I believe is due to MY reality I helped to create. (Damn that blender of bullshit)<br />

			<p>&#8220;Reality determines what is possible, and what isn’t possible. Not your human understanding. So we must constantly evolve our own internal models based on what we observe in reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where I struggle lately. I think the whole intention manifestation theory is closely related to the idea of &#8216;you create your own reality&#8217;. And if you buy into that for a second, then you are basically unable to do any further &#8216;observation&#8217;. Because what good is it to observe a reality that has been created based on your own assumptions about reality? Also you can not disprove it, because any proof why you don&#8217;t create your own reality, can be understood as an created proof resulting from the belief that you don&#8217;t create your own reality. Soo.. how do get out of this loop?</p>

			<p>I had some time to spare so I wrote here some of my thoughts aswell. All&#8217;s made up by me. Would help me if you could find some flaws. I must add english is not my first language but I hope its understandable. Also, I must add I love all your pics.</p>
<p>Then there is no probability, just cause and fact. The causes are fact of other causes and thats how the world &#8220;works&#8221;. Just there are uncountable amount of causes in reality. Only way for your subconcious to predict something is to analyze the reality. For example while predicting the dice roll it has to analyse the current psychical state of roller to predict how will he roll and then how will the dice bounce and where will it stop and some more. If that is right, decision is just an illusion. In fact we chose everything because of a reason, and that reason has its causes, those causes their own causes etc. For example, I saw a Dragon Ball anime when I was young and then 10 years later when I first time read about energy manipulation I &#8220;decide&#8221; to learn it. The cause was anime I&#8217;ve seen but I dont even remember it, I just felt like it would be cool to manipulate energy. Then the choice is illusion. And if we push that forward, all is alredy decided. And if we push it backward, there had to be a &#8220;first cause&#8221;</p>

			<p>Now I&#8217;ve read the entire post and all the comments. Cheers! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I agree with everything you said Sean except for those things that contradicted what Bentinho had to say. I felt convinced by him, but I&#8217;m not sure. I guess I need an experience myself to get my standpoint clear.</p>
<p>Also what war1025 had to say made a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>However, I also agree with Oneta about that it&#8217;s hard to measure whether the conscious and the subc. is aligned or not, and thus it&#8217;s hard to determine what makes intention manifestation work. And again it&#8217;s hard to argue without any experience.</p>
