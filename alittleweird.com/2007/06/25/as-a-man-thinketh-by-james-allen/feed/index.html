		<description>"Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound."

This line is my favorite, as it really hits home.  I have always felt an underlying connection between my wealth and my health.  As I strive to improve myself financially, I often become focused on losing weight and eating right.  There is a very real correlation between interior development and exterior development, even if it is not always obvious and visible.</description>

		<description>A good book by the looks of it. A bit old, but it seems to touch on reality more than going into a senseless metaphysical slurr of thoughts. The only thing I don't like is, that it tries to put good over evil. They're both the same to me, in terms of power. Good, evil, one builds society, the other tries to destroy it. They have both the same power. Just, one is more positive. We all know which one.</description>

		<description>The information in Personal Reality is useful and logically consistent so I'm not complaining :). I think it is possible to verify the phenomena of channelling but I agree that you shouldn't believe everything you hear without any kind of reason too.</description>

		<description>YoYo - I don't remember exactly, but I think I stumbled on it in the Amazon.com recommendations, and read somewhere that it was an old book on intention manifestation.

Hey_you - I've read that book.  I have a few others by Jane Roberts and "Seth" as well.  I think they're interesting, but a lot of it can't be confirmed one way or another, so to me it felt a little cheap.  Still interesting though.

		<description>This is good stuff but the book I just finished reading: The Nature of Personal Reality by Jane Roberts. It talks about the same things except more detailed, less convoluted and talks a lot more about beliefs and how they effect you personal reality. It also reads less like airy-fairy metaphysics even though it is channelled. fgs</description>

		<description>Humm...another book to look into when I get some form of access to a library or bookshop...maybe I'll just use amazon when I turn 18 next year...who knows?

I like the quotes, I mean, nothing new to me. Something I followed by the age of 6(have no friends, you can only do but think and improve)...for a while.</description>
