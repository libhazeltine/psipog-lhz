		<description>Wow yeah,
I really believe that this is true too.
I try not to steal or anything like that.
Well that was mean how those 2 girls didn't see their father :(

I just hope not to get caught up in wrong things ;).

		<description>Yes sad story, unfortunately sad stories like these are very common.

I understand your line of perspective and I agree with the cause and effect phenomenon. I also think that it is good to purify your habits and become more conscious of your behaviour. Not only will it allow more control over yourself in every-day life, but it will also improve your overall quality of life tremendously.

"You reap what you sow"  - Yes very true. However, the more conscious your causes will be made, the less powerfull the bondage to unconscious effects will become. That is a gradual and relatively slow way to create a life build around happy circumstances. But I agree, it is good to choose to make pure decisions. 

Ultimately we (I) would want thought, speech and action to be congruent in total purity. I used to be very strict about that, very disciplined, which was pleasant in a way, but also caused my mind to be disturbed, obsessed and frustrated. I realized this was not the way to perfection for me. Well not by only purifying my deeds.

I realized that being totally pure in thought, speech and action is a result of perfection. It can be a way to perfection, but perfection is not gained through this quickly. IMO the way of living in purity is the result from being fully awake, conscious, in everything we do.

		<description>Sad. Very sad. I always thought most lessons were more subtle than that... 


"My ex-step-dad lied to everyone he knew his entire life.  He cheated on his multiple wives.  He managed to borrow time from Reality for quite a while... but now Reality is cashing in."

Somehow I doubt he'll see it that way. Objectively it makes sense though. Heh, maybe the lesson is for us.</description>

		<description>That is a sad story... I try not to cheat or anything bad like that, just because I believe in karma. If this is true, my brother is going to live a very hard life. =(</description>
