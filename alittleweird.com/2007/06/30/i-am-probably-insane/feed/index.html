		<description>Not to make you get into Buddhism, but your feeling are explained exactly in the fundamental laws of Buddhism.

Everything happens for a reason, and for whatever you do, there will be a relation to it, there will be results.

I can't live my life so freely as to do anything, I also care about everyone, even the ones I "hate", but I do hate them don't get me wrong, I just feel that there's nothing so intense that I can't forgive and calm down(yes I get excited at times too and get carried away). Life always work that way, for every thought there is a response, no matter what you are thinking, for every action there will be a consequence, whether you realize it or not. Based on these, we can predict our future easily based on what we do, and the deeper you can realize your role in this world, the further you can predict.

Maybe you might think "thoughts" can't have any consequences, but isn't psi thoughts? Or aren't there things just based on our thoughts(things happen right?) Even though you don't see it, there will be something happening.


Not to pressure everyone so you don't really have to believe a word I said, Its only my belief anyways.</description>

		<description>Very good read, Sean. (Remember, this is PantsParty... I have a different screenname now... )

See, this is what I enjoy. Generally, 90% of what you said I can understand and agree with. The other 10% is up for debate, really. I think that the way you have things set up here makes for such a debate to occur. I really hope to read more. I really do enjoy reading what you have to say.</description>

		<description>Excellent insight Sean.  I wouldn't say it's original, but that's not as important as the fact that you realized this unoriginal truth of life and had an epiphany.  That's real progress.  What you're summing up I've heard many times in the form of "The World is Your Mirror".

If you get pissed off every time someone acts a certain way/everytime a certain something happens/etc. , it's because you resent whatever that symbolizes in yourself.</description>

		<description>Are we really finding out anything new here? Isn't this stuff that people have known for a long time? "What you do echoes in eternity" or something like that. 

Who you are affects what you do in life. What you do in life affects your views on the world. Your views of the world affect who you are. 

I don't really know if that means anything or matters at all... I just wanted to say it.</description>

		<description>Haha, thisis just the beginning Sean. But it opens up so many doors.

But you're on the right track. Keep it up.

		<description>I know this is going to be a horible twist on what you said but... well... XD

so, are you saying that if I am deciding to leave my girlfriend... I should shit on her? take my emotional dump before she leaves??

...

ok, I am sorry about that, but I had to let that out.  If I may manipulate your comment section to give my 2 cents of input in.

I had a dream like this.  I went lucid shortly, then decided I wanted a dream that would be more fun, so i relinquished my control.  Well with this I ended up tomb raiding... an egyption tomb no less *hah*  Well there was a looking glass, similar to design like the one in LOTR 1, where Frodo looks into the water and see's the future.  Except I saw previous events in my waking life.  and was thinking, maybe I did &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; because of... whatever it may have been.  I woke up thinking, *wow* Life on the inside, is as backwards at life on the outside.  I however exlained this to myself with things you say during sex.  As sex is the most primal things we do.  reaction comes to our own personal instincts, what I say during sex is not what you would say, and visa versa.  but WHY we say it is the difference, the reasoning is different(to relate it to your rain example)

I hope this makes sense.  I did not intend to write out a full blurb.
Sean, if you still have my email, Joshuat......@...il.com  Please email me, I'd like to start a dialogue on this.</description>

		<description>I think everyone of "us" has questioned our own sanity many times. This questioning takes me to the same place every time; I always end up coming to the conclusion that reality is the one thats insane and I'm just sane enough to realize it :D.</description>

		<description>I made this realization a while back. It wasn't a big emotional "wow" type realization. It was more an intellectual: "well if this true than reality must be like this", sort of thing. I also think you can explain it a little better than you did but hey you were tired.</description>
