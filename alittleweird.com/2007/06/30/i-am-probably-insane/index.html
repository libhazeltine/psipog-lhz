			<div class="entry">
				<p>You&#8217;ll have to forgive me.</p>
<p>I was lying in bed, about to fall asleep, when suddenly a bolt of lightning struck me.</p>
<p>My subconscious made a comment to me.  A very calm and seemingly innocent comment.  Perhaps I&#8217;m just insane :-).  That&#8217;s a much more comforting explanation at this point, it seems :-).</p>
<p>My subconscious revealed the metaphor guiding me these past months.  And now I can come to no other conclusion than this reality is a form of dream.  This idea is so overplayed in religion that it leaves a bad taste on my mouth to say it, but now I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> it with my eyes&#8230; so I have no other choice but to admit it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Ok whoa whoa whoa.  Hehehe.  I am insane :-).  Or maybe I just mind-fucked myself.  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>There is a deeper meaning behind our personal realities.  Everything <em>does</em> happen for a reason.</p>
<p>Look&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to go into the realization I made, because it&#8217;s pretty personal, and I don&#8217;t feel like spilling my heart all over the internet for everyone to see :-P.  I mean, I like you guys and everything, but not that much :-P.  But I can break it down from another perspective that is understandable, now that I have some hindsight.</p>
<p>When I say that &#8220;reality is a form of dream&#8221;, what I&#8217;m talking about is how dreams have deeper meaning when looked at from a metaphorical perspective.  So does this reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very interesting to analyze your own dreams and see how things manifest.  For example, dreaming of taking a shit can represent unloading emotional waste that&#8217;s built up inside of yourself, and be a sign of growth and psychological cleansing.  So in real life, perhaps you are dealing with old problems that you feel need to be taken care of for you to move on, and tying up loose ends.  As a result, one night you dream of taking a massive shit in a bathroom.  You wake up thinking, &#8220;Now where did that come from?  Very bizarre!&#8221;  But there is an underlying meaning.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.</p>
<p>So, what I&#8217;m saying is that this reality also has this same <em>exact</em> sort of deeper meaning.  What we manifest in this reality is a reflection of who we are and what we are dealing with - just like in dreams.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  This is what intention manifestation tries to talk about (but fails, I believe).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that this reality uses the <em>exact same</em> metaphor function that dreams use.  The exact same function.  This is why this reality is a form of dream.  This is also why intention manifestation actually produces results.  It hijacks and focuses this metaphorical function of reality to produce an outcome.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m explaining this correctly or not.  Maybe I&#8217;m not giving enough examples.  Let me try again.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re walking outside, what do you do if it suddenly starts to rain?  Do you run for shelter?  Do you pause and enjoy the sprinkles?  Depending on your personal reality, this reaction means different things.  If you run for shelter, perhaps you do this because you feel you need to run from your problems.  Other problems you experience in life, you run from.  Do you curse the weather?  This might mean you feel you&#8217;re being treated unjustly by &#8220;God&#8221;.  The weather could represent a system that is out of man&#8217;s control, and therefore only under the control of &#8220;God&#8221;.  If it rains on you, you feel that &#8220;God&#8221; is unjustly making your life miserable, so you curse the rain.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  Do you see how this is the same function as dreaming as well?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all connected.  All the ideas in your head, all the beliefs you hold, all the emotions you feel, all the experiences you have in this reality&#8230; it&#8217;s all connected.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that if you run from the rain, that you run from your problems.  It depends on who you are as a person.  Just like your dreams&#8230; if you dream about being in the bathroom, it might represent a time period where you need to do some psychological cleansing.  But if you are a janitor for a living, then the idea of being in a bathroom would have a completely different meaning to you, since you probably clean a lot of bathrooms for a living.  Perhaps it means it&#8217;s time to clean up someone else&#8217;s mess?</p>
<p>Ok&#8230; so anyways.  The important part about this is that reality does this.  The experiences you&#8217;ve had in your life have meaning.  They happened for a reason.  Think of it like a dream.  What is the metaphor?  What does it emotionally mean to you?  Decode it like you would decode waking up from a bizarre dream.</p>
<p>Now I really do need to get to sleep.  This realization has interrupted me :-P.  I&#8217;ll probably read this in the morning and face-palm :-P.</p>

			<p>I think this is what they try and teach with psychology, but no one ever listens. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> So while it is a better way of explaining for the people who can&#8217;t come to grips with what the field of psychology has to offer, I think you basically summed up the study of psychology in this post.</p>

			<p>Hello Peebs. I&#8217;m Brandon. I&#8217;m not really replying to your post. I am merely using the only method I know of to contact you. I have so much to say and yet, it seems that these days you probably don&#8217;t want to hear it. I cannot thank you enough for showing me the vocabulary of this craft. I spent most of my life not knowing what I was doing and believing that everyone could do it as well. If you remember, then you know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>Through your previous site I was able to shape what I was going through into logical realizations. At first I believed us to all be insane&#8230; that is, until our practices. What a sight! Should any skeptic had seen that, they&#8217;d probably shit themselves. </p>
<p>I remember the first article that I requested to be published. You made me prove it to you. You said that you have never felt a &#8220;ping&#8221; like mine. Now I know why, but that isn&#8217;t the most important part.</p>
<p>I love and hate you for bringing such a conduit for what I was/am going through into my life. I honestly wish I never found your site&#8230;. but at the same time, I can&#8217;t say that. It was great! It&#8217;s just that the reality of it all (after you surpass the &#8220;whoa&#8221; factor) really scares the shit outta me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at the point where the &#8216;parlor tricks&#8217; are over. I can&#8217;t float a swiss army knife in my hand, but I can tell you what demons look like - what they feel like - what they are like. I&#8217;ve ran out of guidance. Everything is so &#8220;fluffy&#8221; on the web, and I&#8217;m lost yet again. As close to the truth as I may be, I still want PsiPog back.</p>
<p>Revive the community and you will revive the collective consciousness of our practice.</p>
<p>PS: No, I&#8217;m not crazy. Email me if you like: <a href="mailto:minty_mental_floss@yahoo.com.">minty_mental_floss@yahoo.com.</a> I&#8217;d love to hear from ya.</p>

			<p>I made this realization a while back. It wasn&#8217;t a big emotional &#8220;wow&#8221; type realization. It was more an intellectual: &#8220;well if this true than reality must be like this&#8221;, sort of thing. I also think you can explain it a little better than you did but hey you were tired.</p>

			<p>I think everyone of &#8220;us&#8221; has questioned our own sanity many times. This questioning takes me to the same place every time; I always end up coming to the conclusion that reality is the one thats insane and I&#8217;m just sane enough to realize it :D.</p>

			<p>I know this is going to be a horible twist on what you said but&#8230; well&#8230; XD</p>
<p>so, are you saying that if I am deciding to leave my girlfriend&#8230; I should shit on her? take my emotional dump before she leaves??</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>ok, I am sorry about that, but I had to let that out.  If I may manipulate your comment section to give my 2 cents of input in.</p>
<p>I had a dream like this.  I went lucid shortly, then decided I wanted a dream that would be more fun, so i relinquished my control.  Well with this I ended up tomb raiding&#8230; an egyption tomb no less *hah*  Well there was a looking glass, similar to design like the one in LOTR 1, where Frodo looks into the water and see&#8217;s the future.  Except I saw previous events in my waking life.  and was thinking, maybe I did <i>that</i> because of&#8230; whatever it may have been.  I woke up thinking, *wow* Life on the inside, is as backwards at life on the outside.  I however exlained this to myself with things you say during sex.  As sex is the most primal things we do.  reaction comes to our own personal instincts, what I say during sex is not what you would say, and visa versa.  but WHY we say it is the difference, the reasoning is different(to relate it to your rain example)</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense.  I did not intend to write out a full blurb.<br />
Sean, if you still have my email, <a href="mailto:Joshuat......@...il.com">Joshuat&#8230;&#8230;@&#8230;il.com</a>  Please email me, I&#8217;d like to start a dialogue on this.</p>

			<p>Are we really finding out anything new here? Isn&#8217;t this stuff that people have known for a long time? &#8220;What you do echoes in eternity&#8221; or something like that. </p>
<p>Who you are affects what you do in life. What you do in life affects your views on the world. Your views of the world affect who you are. </p>

			<p>Excellent insight Sean.  I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s original, but that&#8217;s not as important as the fact that you realized this unoriginal truth of life and had an epiphany.  That&#8217;s real progress.  What you&#8217;re summing up I&#8217;ve heard many times in the form of &#8220;The World is Your Mirror&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you get pissed off every time someone acts a certain way/everytime a certain something happens/etc. , it&#8217;s because you resent whatever that symbolizes in yourself.</p>

			<p>Very good read, Sean. (Remember, this is PantsParty&#8230; I have a different screenname now&#8230; )</p>
<p>See, this is what I enjoy. Generally, 90% of what you said I can understand and agree with. The other 10% is up for debate, really. I think that the way you have things set up here makes for such a debate to occur. I really hope to read more. I really do enjoy reading what you have to say.</p>

			<p>Not to make you get into Buddhism, but your feeling are explained exactly in the fundamental laws of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason, and for whatever you do, there will be a relation to it, there will be results.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t live my life so freely as to do anything, I also care about everyone, even the ones I &#8220;hate&#8221;, but I do hate them don&#8217;t get me wrong, I just feel that there&#8217;s nothing so intense that I can&#8217;t forgive and calm down(yes I get excited at times too and get carried away). Life always work that way, for every thought there is a response, no matter what you are thinking, for every action there will be a consequence, whether you realize it or not. Based on these, we can predict our future easily based on what we do, and the deeper you can realize your role in this world, the further you can predict.</p>
<p>Maybe you might think &#8220;thoughts&#8221; can&#8217;t have any consequences, but isn&#8217;t psi thoughts? Or aren&#8217;t there things just based on our thoughts(things happen right?) Even though you don&#8217;t see it, there will be something happening.</p>
<p>Not to pressure everyone so you don&#8217;t really have to believe a word I said, Its only my belief anyways.</p>
