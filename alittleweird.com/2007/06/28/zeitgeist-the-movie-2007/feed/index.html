		<description>Interesting movie, ever since I first watched it about 6 months ago I have been curious about it ever since.

I can see how 9/11 "could" have been a set up, and I am fairly certain that sometime soon we will have a world government, but Christianity being false... now that is just bull shit.

1. What is the point of living if there is no hope for an afterlife? Why not just die off?

2. In Zeitgeist it says there will be a world government, all the religions in the world are the same, and all religions are stories created by the government to control the plebeians. First of all in the book of Revelations it does predict that there would be a world government with a world ruler, and a world religion run by some type of government appointed religious leader. According to Zeitgeist all religions in the world are the same, so would it not be very easy, with all of the tolerance in the world today, to create a world religion? Now if that were to happen, what does that mean for the Bible? And what about statements put forth by Zeitgeist? Also why would so many governments over the past thousands of years want to destroy the bible?

There are probably more things that should come into mind, but until then I hope you understand what I am saying...

		<description>I really don't see what the whole first section has to do with the rest of the movie..I mean, it's interesting, but I don't see what it has to do with the banks/WTC.

Oh well, interesting movie...I'm a bit skeptical of several points, but I think they're onto something--America and the world needs to wake up and take responsibility for its own future, or these "social elite" will do it for us. But for some reason I don't see the McDonalds society of today getting off its ass fast enough to do anything about it, or giving a damn at all...

It would appear the future IS hopeless...oh well, I guess I should go watch reruns of "Lost" while I still can.</description>

		<description>Hello to everyone.
About the first part, I think it's total bull shit because, at first, How can anybody know when Jesus was born.The date can't be true because of two major things, one is that there has been many changes in the calendars and two, as I know the hebrews were counting the years backwards in that time(I'm not familiar about counting days,months but surely it had an effect on the dates).Second, how can religion be an tool for mass manipulation when most religions don't get along with the material world government.Jesus himself was some kind of a rebel his days.About the WTC incident, the first time i saw the falling of the towers i thought that it's weird how they fall like they were made of paper, and almost comletely vertical to the ground.The part three, I always knew that they are controling us with money, but I didn't know how.I was suspicious to the government a long time before I saw these movie, and I have decided to, somehow, dodge the banks and not to work for any company(if i must work then be it for me, like a private company or alone standing worker).Besides, I hate materialism and I try to free myself from it.
Nice blog Sean, I've been reading your posts since psipog and I recently started visiting the codetank webpage and think that your writing is ill.Sorry for the grammar(if I had mistakes), but I don't use English outside my English classes in school.</description>

		<description>I realise this topic has been long dead, but I just thought that I should point out that several of its facts - especially in part one - are questionable at best, and some are dead wrong.  Certainly, so far as I can tell Orion is always in the west, setting at dawn on Christmas Day.

You can tell that the movie has been pieced together from other ones - I think I saw some "Loose Change" in there.  As far as conspiracy theory movies go, it's certainly not the best I've seen.  As for the conspiracy itself, well, I am no physicist and can offer no professional opinion on 911 and the collapse and why it happened the way it did.  I don't know why there was no debris on the lawn of the Pentagon or why the surveillance tapes were seized.  I do, however, know that it has raised a lot of questions and if it were as simple a matter as the official story, then there wouldn't still be questions - or as many, at least.  And it's healthy to question your government - and it's a little scary to see all these new government measures being put up "for your protection".</description>

		<description>So that's why the people in my college class in England are with lesser intelect then I am.
A classmate 19years old canot ad a fraction 21/22+22/23. Not of the speaking of the teachers who don't know how to spell a words.
And when I asked to help me with maths she sed that she doesin't has a level in it so she will not explain me.
With anger a few days after I pastes the 1km to 1.000.000mm wich is simple 3grade maths. The clas mates didn't even knew the dm one and I can cari on with that stuff..........................
Talking about the bogus stuff Thanks Sean for showing me the Zeitgeist.
Now my hands are trembling because of the realising the truth wich is SHOCKING.

		<description>Do you realize on the website it doesn't show who the documentary was created by or sponsored by? 

It doesn't seem to me like it's not legit on the surface. I think I want to dig deeper first.

I mean, if we blindly accept all of what the documentary says, we'll be doing the same thing we did with 9/11, which the documentary illustrates and warns us against.</description>

		<description>"1. Very few scholars question the historical existence of Jesus. Jesus was a real person, no matter what theological details you believe, He led a real movement. There are myths surrounding him but to claim he didn’t exist is ludicrous. Note: I’m not strictly what you would call christian."

I agree with you hey_you, Jesus probably was a real person. But on the other hand I don't believe he did half the stuff they said he did. Anyways I think these videos are always so interesting.</description>

2. The 9/11 conspiracy theory has been debunked numerous times. These people are very selective of information. I don't want to write an essay, so, if you believe it please do some real research. 

3. I don't know about this banker conspiracy theory. To a degree I think it is true. I knew that the government knew about pearl harbor before it happened before I saw this movie. To a far more moderate degree I think there is some truth to this.</description>
