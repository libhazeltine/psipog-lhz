			<p>i always knew that the bible wasnt speaking of TRUE events, although.. i was under the belief that they made up the idea of &#8220;divine retribution&#8221; because so many can take so much, they had to instill fear in the followers to both keep them in line and make them think before they act. half of me wanted to say that, the other half wanted me to be quiet.. because if you think about it.. if there is no concequince for your actions.. then you would probly live free, kill, rape, steal,<br />
and i always wonder.. why people want the truth so much, that they are willing to put life as we know it on the line. if people didnt believe in divine retribution.. there would be a young punk climbing through my window right now!</p>
<p>but i suppose i could be wrong.. we all have our own beliefs</p>

			<p>i just thought of something:</p>
<p>if the sun is the son of god,<br />
does that mean that god is the universe?<br />
and if the &#8220;big bang&#8221; created the sun and planets<br />
then that means that we are the sons of god too right?<br />
god is our grandfather <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>let me try to clear that up:</p>
<p>universe &gt; big bang = birth of planets &gt; planets give birth to life forms (humans plants animals)</p>

			<p>This film contains many of the most controversial conspiracy theory movies, which are around today on the net and deals with an interesting conclusion of how the last dramatic changes in history of the last decades could lead us to a world government.</p>
<p>As with every conspiracy theory you have to deal with them very careful but in my opinion they are an important appearance of our societies as they reflect concerns and worries of people who want us to look further behind the superficial aspects in our lives. And I totally agree with the movie that this<br />
time we are living in is really worrying and all of this is initiated by the will of all of *us* people and can also be stopped by us IF we decide to do that.</p>
<p>We live in a time where the internet provides us a global platform to express our freedom of speech and where a shift in user created contend, like broadcasting or own made television programs, allows us to spread controversial ideas without fearing censorship and construct a public opinion made *by* the public and not by some few people with hidden personal/economical interests.</p>
<p>This movie is a wakeup call and as long as we can broadcast such information as seen in this film on a platform like Google-video, which is a new form of media feed by the user and watched by an rapidly growing user base and probably changing the way we will watch television in the future, more people will hopefully wake just up <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>And when the time comes, when companies like Google will start censoring our content, we know we have said something profound true and I am pretty sure censorship is arriving soon <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Damn, super interesting movie. </p>
<p>Under the assumption that it&#8217;s all true; What can anyone do about it? Not get a job? Not help the system? Not join the military? Speak out?</p>
<p>Is a world-government that bad of a thing? I suppose it is when the means of propagating it are full of lies, deceit, greed, and pain. When the end goal is not for everyone to be living a happy life full of enjoyment and the fruits of their own labors&#8230; But that they be mere pawns in the games of some elite ruling class. </p>
<p>So, what does someone do who knows this kind of information?</p>

			<p>&#8220;So, what does someone do who knows this kind of information?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this issue.  And I believe I have a solution, in a theoretical sense.  And this solution doesn&#8217;t depend on the validity of this particular movie.</p>
<p>I believe the solution is to create a new form of government.  Our current system is corrupt, so we need to create something new in it&#8217;s place.  This movie makes us think of revolution and stuff like that&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think we need to do anything extreme.  We can be smart about it.  We have political scientists who have been studying systems of government for a long time.  I think it&#8217;s time we start putting their knowledge to use.</p>
<p>While I did find this movie interesting, ultimately it doesn&#8217;t provide any answers.  It just points out huge problems that exist.  I believe the next step is to create a solution, and make a movie of it :-).  A better form of government that fixes the problems of our current one, and hopefully doesn&#8217;t create too many new problems :-P.</p>
<p>I mean - ultimately, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening according to this movie.  Some sneaky guys in a smoke filled room are trying to change our form of government to a Oligarchy.  And since no one in their right mind would willing choose to live in an Oligarchy, they have to manipulate the population slowly over time to transition into one.</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s change.  But instead of an Oligarchy, let&#8217;s make a new form of government that isn&#8217;t susceptible to corruption in it&#8217;s current form.  Now sure - we can&#8217;t make a perfect system that is incapable of corruption&#8230; but we don&#8217;t have to.  We just need to change the system, and do the best we can at this moment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my take on it.  Check this out: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy</a></p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, let’s change. But instead of an Oligarchy, let’s make a new form of government that isn’t susceptible to corruption in it’s current form. Now sure - we can’t make a perfect system that is incapable of corruption… but we don’t have to. We just need to change the system, and do the best we can at this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think a lot of different forms of government have been &#8220;thought up&#8221; to resist this happening, our country was supposed to resist this. I do  not necessarily believe that we have to make even a &#8220;drastic&#8221; change to our system. But do not get me wrong, a big change would be needed.</p>
<p>That change would have to be in the people. According to philosophy that I currently prescribe to&#8230; You can&#8217;t put blame only on one source. For example, a car &#8220;accident&#8221; lies in the responsibility of multiple parties. The guy infront of you shouldn&#8217;t have suddenly braked, but you shouldn&#8217;t have been tail-gating. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Talking with my brother and friend who constantly say how much they hate and distrust the governmnet, I always respond with &#8220;The government is supposed to be an extension of the people, not only is it their fault for screwing us over, it is our fault for letting it happen. It is our responsibility to make sure the government does not over-step its boundries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not the movie portrays the &#8220;truth&#8221; about what is going on in our government and it&#8217;s take over by the few&#8230; The system is still incredibly flawed as long as people make it a fact to know what  Paris Hilton feels about marijuana, instead of knowing why we subsidies huge farms and destroy large portions of food-stuffs to balance out the &#8220;market&#8221; for agribusiness :-p.</p>
<p>Priorities need to be arranged.</p>

			<p>But people DON&#8217;T want to know what Paris Hilton feels about marijuana.  The vast majority of people are disgusted with the extent at which the media covers Paris Hilton - including Paris herself!  Including the reporters themselves! <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ul3zgUfSgqY" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ul3zgUfSgqY</a></p>
<p>I do agree with your logic though.  It&#8217;s pointless to blame the ambiguous label &#8220;government&#8221; for things.  We are human, and we created this.  We&#8217;re all in it together, and collectively reap both praise and blame.</p>
<p>The change does have to originate in the people - I agree.  I bet the internet will play an important role in that.  We shall see! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Man&#8230;what the heck&#8230;I get all interested in the Religious stuff, and then it springs war propaganda on me. So I just turned the movie off. I don&#8217;t care what the government does as I said many times before. I&#8217;m only living like 75 years at most, and I don&#8217;t even care to live past 40 really. In those 40 years if debt and the war on terror attribute to my discomfort, than I might. But by then, I&#8217;d probably just move from America. I&#8217;ve got so much more in my life to worry about than what the government is doing. Sure you can say it might eventually lead to reigns of terrorism, or something, but it isn&#8217;t like the people who matter most to me aren&#8217;t already dead or dying. So I think I&#8217;ll worry about that first before I worry about what the government is doing to some 3rd world country.</p>

			<p>I thought I might point this out a little. The solution to the situation, as I personally believe, lies in knowledge. Knowledge has always managed to elevate humanity, or indeed, any species at all, from the oppressor of their time and space. Be it natural predator, habitat, or corrupted government. </p>
<p>In my opinion, if isn&#8217;t for knowledge, Europe would still be in the Dark Ages, thumping their bible and sprouting their gospel. It is then without surprise, that most power-mad government seek to marginalize the out-spread of knowledge among it&#8217;s populace. Some of the more sectarian parts of Middle-East, for an example, which restricts the dispensation of mainstream education. </p>
<p>As suggested by the movie, the manipulators in the background seem to opt for that option as well, seeking to &#8216;dumbify&#8217; those who they control. They know that knowledge can be a powerful tool, it prevents people from being limited to what you want them to know and to think and consequently, to act. </p>
<p>That said, I believe the movie did address this issue towards the end, implying that the very purpose they made this movie was for the very sake of edging people on to find out for themselves, and to practice critical thinking, which is implied (at least in my opinion) in the movie and further enforced with the following quote in their statement on their website &#8220;It is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth, but find out for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I do believe that whether or not the shadowy machiavellian manipulators do exist or not, the potential for this exploit is simply too great. But I do believe that no plan is perfect, even theirs, and a perfect plan becomes a heap of trash over the course and ravage of time as no one can accurately predict the exact sequence that the future might turn out (.. unless they can.). The movie and the sometimes free dispensation of knowledge over the internet seem to be a testament for this train of thought, suggesting that we might, afterall, stand a chance in escaping the iron grip on freedom. </p>
<p>Anyway, straying a little from the topic I was relating: &#8220;I’ve got so much more in my life to worry about than what the government is doing. Sure you can say it might eventually lead to reigns of terrorism, or something, but it isn’t like the people who matter most to me aren’t already dead or dying. So I think I’ll worry about that first before I worry about what the government is doing to some 3rd world country.&#8221; Which I find to be what would exactly make me happy if I am one of those manipulative fellas who smoke too much cigar. This way of thinking, I feel, is actually quite popular, and is perhaps the very reason why I feel that the conspiracy suggested in the Zeitgeist movie just might be true.</p>

			<p>I watched the entire film and have had a couple of days to digest.</p>
<p>All right bare with me here…<br />
Astrology is the interpretation of the stars that have always been there correct? Or at the very least whether you believe in God, a creator or not a very long time. Would that “long time” be BEFORE the interpretation of them? Of course. No one found a book or cave drawings or Egyptian tablets of Toris the Bull and concluded they needed to wait for night fall and look up to see what whom ever was depicting.<br />
So explain to me how it is that we are passing through “ages” or someone’s interpretations of stars that have been there and THIS holds more truth than a book of letters, prophecies and recorded events that took place? (I.E. the bible)<br />
Forty plus authors, sixty six letters &amp; books spanning hundreds of years of time that some of the most powerful influential rulers and kings of the entire world tried to destroy, abolish and stamp out. Yet it survives as the number one published and distributed piece of literature EVER in the history of civilization and one of the characters (whether you believe he existed or not) predicted that there would be deceivers and false prophets.<br />
What then I ask is a greater leap of faith? Interpreting the stars and decoding the bibles words to fit? Or trusting what was written through faith and simply asking (praying) for wisdom and truth?<br />
I&#8217;ll take my chances with Jesus fella&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>1. Very few scholars question the historical existence of Jesus. Jesus was a real person, no matter what theological details you believe, He led a real movement. There are myths surrounding him but to claim he didn&#8217;t exist is ludicrous. Note: I&#8217;m not strictly what you would call christian. </p>
<p>2. The 9/11 conspiracy theory has been debunked numerous times. These people are very selective of information. I don&#8217;t want to write an essay, so, if you believe it please do some real research. </p>
<p>3. I don&#8217;t know about this banker conspiracy theory. To a degree I think it is true. I knew that the government knew about pearl harbor before it happened before I saw this movie. To a far more moderate degree I think there is some truth to this.</p>

<p>I agree with you hey_you, Jesus probably was a real person. But on the other hand I don&#8217;t believe he did half the stuff they said he did. Anyways I think these videos are always so interesting.</p>

			<p>Do you realize on the website it doesn&#8217;t show who the documentary was created by or sponsored by? </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to me like it&#8217;s not legit on the surface. I think I want to dig deeper first.</p>
<p>I mean, if we blindly accept all of what the documentary says, we&#8217;ll be doing the same thing we did with 9/11, which the documentary illustrates and warns us against.</p>

			<p>I realise this topic has been long dead, but I just thought that I should point out that several of its facts - especially in part one - are questionable at best, and some are dead wrong.  Certainly, so far as I can tell Orion is always in the west, setting at dawn on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>You can tell that the movie has been pieced together from other ones - I think I saw some &#8220;Loose Change&#8221; in there.  As far as conspiracy theory movies go, it&#8217;s certainly not the best I&#8217;ve seen.  As for the conspiracy itself, well, I am no physicist and can offer no professional opinion on 911 and the collapse and why it happened the way it did.  I don&#8217;t know why there was no debris on the lawn of the Pentagon or why the surveillance tapes were seized.  I do, however, know that it has raised a lot of questions and if it were as simple a matter as the official story, then there wouldn&#8217;t still be questions - or as many, at least.  And it&#8217;s healthy to question your government - and it&#8217;s a little scary to see all these new government measures being put up &#8220;for your protection&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Hello to everyone.<br />
About the first part, I think it&#8217;s total bull shit because, at first, How can anybody know when Jesus was born.The date can&#8217;t be true because of two major things, one is that there has been many changes in the calendars and two, as I know the hebrews were counting the years backwards in that time(I&#8217;m not familiar about counting days,months but surely it had an effect on the dates).Second, how can religion be an tool for mass manipulation when most religions don&#8217;t get along with the material world government.Jesus himself was some kind of a rebel his days.About the WTC incident, the first time i saw the falling of the towers i thought that it&#8217;s weird how they fall like they were made of paper, and almost comletely vertical to the ground.The part three, I always knew that they are controling us with money, but I didn&#8217;t know how.I was suspicious to the government a long time before I saw these movie, and I have decided to, somehow, dodge the banks and not to work for any company(if i must work then be it for me, like a private company or alone standing worker).Besides, I hate materialism and I try to free myself from it.<br />
Nice blog Sean, I&#8217;ve been reading your posts since psipog and I recently started visiting the codetank webpage and think that your writing is ill.Sorry for the grammar(if I had mistakes), but I don&#8217;t use English outside my English classes in school.</p>

			<p>I really don&#8217;t see what the whole first section has to do with the rest of the movie..I mean, it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t see what it has to do with the banks/WTC.</p>
<p>Oh well, interesting movie&#8230;I&#8217;m a bit skeptical of several points, but I think they&#8217;re onto something&#8211;America and the world needs to wake up and take responsibility for its own future, or these &#8220;social elite&#8221; will do it for us. But for some reason I don&#8217;t see the McDonalds society of today getting off its ass fast enough to do anything about it, or giving a damn at all&#8230;</p>
<p>It would appear the future IS hopeless&#8230;oh well, I guess I should go watch reruns of &#8220;Lost&#8221; while I still can.</p>

			<p>Interesting movie, ever since I first watched it about 6 months ago I have been curious about it ever since.</p>
<p>I can see how 9/11 &#8220;could&#8221; have been a set up, and I am fairly certain that sometime soon we will have a world government, but Christianity being false&#8230; now that is just bull shit.</p>
<p>1. What is the point of living if there is no hope for an afterlife? Why not just die off?</p>
<p>2. In Zeitgeist it says there will be a world government, all the religions in the world are the same, and all religions are stories created by the government to control the plebeians. First of all in the book of Revelations it does predict that there would be a world government with a world ruler, and a world religion run by some type of government appointed religious leader. According to Zeitgeist all religions in the world are the same, so would it not be very easy, with all of the tolerance in the world today, to create a world religion? Now if that were to happen, what does that mean for the Bible? And what about statements put forth by Zeitgeist? Also why would so many governments over the past thousands of years want to destroy the bible?</p>
<p>There are probably more things that should come into mind, but until then I hope you understand what I am saying&#8230;</p>
<p>FOR YOUR SAKES!!!</p>
