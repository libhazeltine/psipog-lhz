		<description>I am new here so please excuse the late post.  I have to tell you that in addition to loving this site, I love words.  Sean, I hope you don't mind but I took what you said "Reality is a blur, how do you draw a line in fluid?" and actually printed it out so I could post above my computer.  Wow, I love that!</description>

		<description>Argh! I'll cut myself! Sorry about triple post. Won't happen again.
To Felix the Cat:
Knowing you're a psion, that changes everything! Me too, lol. I agree with you that the term psychic is misused and with Sean that it's been loaded full of crap by people pretending and ruining the real thing. I don't think there is a real definition for subconscious. For some people it's inner voice plus subconscious. For others its separated. Like the SP justice said, we don't know how to define it, but we know it when we feel it.</description>

		<description>As far as terms go, I don't think it matters too much so long as everyone's consistant. Or at least know what someone's talking about.

		<description>Everyone is constantly trying to understand the world, with the possible exceptions of enlightened religious figures such as the Lord Buddha, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Jesus Christ (PBUH), etc.

I'm not skeptical in the sense that I don't believe in psychic abilities - I am a natural empath, work with energy on a regular basis, do OBE-related practice nearly nightly, and have in the past had some success with RV and micro-PK. I'm quite the opposite of a skeptic when it comes to psi!

I think I can express what I was trying to say more coherently and succinctly tonight.

Sean says that we shouldn't differentiate between "psychic" and "non-psychic". That's fine; it's a perfectly valid point of view, and one that works when interacting with fellow psions. One natural effect of rejecting that difference is that "psychic" loses its meaning.

Then he goes on to describe how he uses his psychic abilities on a daily basis. This contradicts his other statement, since if there is no functional difference between "psychic" and "non-psychic" actions, then there is no basis on which to discriminate between (to borrow NeoPsychic's turn of phrase) OBE and taking a crap.

Sean is indeed (probably) correct that there is no theoretical, physical, unversal distinction between "psychic" and "non-psychic" stuff. However, there's certainly a socially defined one, and one that he uses in the second half of his post.

Personally, I'm not bothered by the distinction between "psychic" and "non-psychic". I feel the same way about "psionics" that a certain Supreme Court justice felt about "pornography" - "I can't define it, but I know it when I see it." As long as my "know it when I see it" mostly overlaps with yours and everyone else's, then we're fine.

While I'm clarifying, I might as well give an example of what I feel the difference between your "subconscious" and your "inner voice" is.

Your subconscious is what makes you want to chuckle when someone introduces himself as "Dick Cox". Your inner voice is what tells you that you shouldn't, and that you're a sophomoric fool for even subconsciously considering it.

...that's enough about my thoughts - I try not to use others' blog comments sections as places to share my own thoughts on things, but rather as places to react to the blog. Then again, this is sort of filling a void left by the demise of the PsiPog forums. (Simply put: there's nowhere else to discuss psionics, dangit!)</description>

		<description>Sorry for double post, but I had to say something in this discussion. I think Felix the Cat is going through the stage where he is trying to understand the world. The whole thing about being 'magical' or mechanical, as Sean posted in his last blog on psipog. He is skeptic and the idea of psychic abilities is conflicting with mechanical reality. The thing is, as Felix said, we have to draw lines between psychic and non-psychic, but not to put too much stress on them, like Sean said. First, we have to define psychic. Sorry to be the guy who takes words out of the dictionary, but as I said in my previous post, people use the same words to define different things. Here is the definition of psychic from the Cambridge dictionary: "having to do with the mind and the emotions rather than with the body". Technically, what Sean mentions in his post would be correct. Gotta cut this short because I have to go. Sorry for what I just did (dictionary definition), because I always hate it when people do it to me. I agree mostly with Sean but also with Felix.</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;However, terming a certain phenomenon “psychic” or “non-psychic” isn’t a question of its bearing on, effect on, or relation to “reality”. It’s a social question.&lt;/em&gt;

On the surface it's a social question.  But how many people internally think of it as a reality question?  Just stating something like, "Psychic abilities don't exist", or "Psychic abilities do exist", now turn it into a question about reality.

&lt;em&gt;Similarly, I wouldn’t consider communicating with what you call your subconscious to be psychic, either.&lt;/em&gt;

And if I get psychic information from my subconscious?  Like the location of winning lottery tickets?  Or if I get help leaving my body from what I label my subconscious?

&lt;em&gt;Perhaps something that you could consider in a future post, if you would find it of interest, would be exactly what constitutes “psychic”.&lt;/em&gt;

I'm trying to do the opposite with this post.  I think it's better if we release the label, and just accept reality as reality.  Our label has acquired too much crap, so I recommend individuals just let it go.</description>

		<description>If someone where to ask me "how I use psychic abilities on a daily basis.." I also would have a hard time answering it. I just use them so much that it's like trying to remember the exact time I took a crap. (Yeah bad example). I guess, if anyone can answer the question the same way I did then the will be psychic for life. Which would be interesting, because most psions nowadays are young with the oldest ones being about 30-35. (Didn't include Sean's dad, who's probably older.)</description>
