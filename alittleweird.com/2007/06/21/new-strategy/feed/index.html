		<description>THe law of attraction is a lot different to me. This is focusing on what you want. This is more dedicated to me. The law of attraction just says: "I if you wish for it you shall recieve" That to me is hogwash.</description>

		<description>I have been following all your posts on this topic, and I have a question.. I know of something that a lot call the 'law of attraction', and this sounds a lot like this. How is this different, or is it different?</description>

		<description>This reminds me of a Bulgarian joke:

There once was a lazy man. He was very poor and had nothing to eat. One day, he went to church to pray to God. He kneels and prays, "Please, dear God, in the heavens above, help me win the lottery." Surprisingly, God comes down and tells the poor man, "Ok. You will win the lottery!" Happy, the man goes back home and waits to win the lottery. After two weeks, he still hasn't won the lottery, so he goes back to the church and asks, "God, why haven't I won the lottery yet?" A heavenly voice responds, "Well, it would help if you bought a ticket..."</description>

		<description>With intention manifestation, our goal is to induce the “sense of knowing”. We can do that with visualization, altering our beliefs, feeling the success, etc.

^^ sorry to bring this up, but :
exactly like psionics. You can visualize all you want, but if you don't actually use psi, nothing will happen. Sure it helps, but it doesn't do the job.</description>

		<description>Sean-I don’t see how winning the jackpot is a big goal. It’s just numbers. From a reality/universal perspective… it’s just 6 numbers. Now, to humans those 6 numbers mean a lot, but I don’t see how that is “big” in the universe’s eyes.

The reason those 6 little numbers area big goal is because of what they represent.  6 little numbers may seem like just 6 little numbers but getting them on a ticket you hold in your hand represents significant change in your sphere and thats what makes them a big goal.

The reasons its not wise to get angry and frustrated is because that anger and frustration just brings you more anger and frustration.  You will attract more of what feeling.</description>

		<description>obsidian: you're absolutely right with that. i'm a tennis player and they even teach beginners visualization. you need a good visual, you need to stay positive, focus and in the zone. the 'in the zone' part is where you are completely mindless and you just follow your instincts and subconscious completely. 
kinda like with samurais; you are supposed to have no mind; you follow the tao or great spirit. aka your sub</description>

		<description>There are thousands of number combinations, can you write them all and check before ? lots of work :) because if you skip one combo it might be the one with even bigger sense of knowing</description>
