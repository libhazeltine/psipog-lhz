			<div class="entry">
				<p>So I had a lucid dream last night.  Before I continue, I&#8217;d like to point out that the MegaMillions Jackpot is at $45 million - <a href="../../03/the-lottery-one-last-time/index.html">the amount I require before I start playing</a>.  Back to my dream&#8230;</p>
<p>Before I fell asleep, I told myself that I wanted to have a lucid dream so I could investigate the lottery.  Maybe get some numbers, or some techniques&#8230; something.  Seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>I became lucid a few hours into sleeping, during the beginning of a long period of dreaming.  I knew I had a lot of time to kill before I would wake up (as long as I didn&#8217;t excite myself too much), and decided to get some answers about the lottery.  I was inside a huge Victorian house that was also partly a mall, and there were tons of people around me.</p>
<p>I started by grabbing the next available person, and asking them, &#8220;How do I win the lottery?&#8221;  They said they didn&#8217;t know.  I asked another person.  They didn&#8217;t know.  I went up to another person, and declared that they would be representing my subconscious mind.  I asked them how to win&#8230; they had a slightly longer response that boiled down to not knowing.</p>
<p>I left the area I was in, pretty frustrated.  I saw some children playing, and asked them what they were doing.  They said they represented different parts of myself - different characteristics.  I asked them how to win the lottery - I asked them for numbers, and for techniques to try.  They didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>By this time I was getting a little frustrated.  I began searching for someone who should know, instead of asking random strangers.  I would see someone and scoff them away, because I knew they wouldn&#8217;t know.  Person by person&#8230; I floated downstairs, partly surfing on the banister (hey, I was lucid, might as well have some fun :-P).  I turned a corner and saw a religious black man, who looked like a shaman.</p>
<p>I made friends with him and asked him how to win the lottery.  He told me he didn&#8217;t know of the top of his head, but he knew where we could find out.  He said he could look it up for me (in a book?), and to follow him.  So I did.</p>
<p>We winded around the house, going all over, and eventually found the stairs to the basement.  We went down, but it wasn&#8217;t a basement - it was the outdoors.  It was shifting between night time, and day time, in the matter of a few seconds.  He started doing some ritual, and the stars in the sky started to move.  He told me he would find out by reading the stars.  I told him I thought he was going to use books in a library - he said he could do that too, but that we could also use the stars.  I said ok.</p>
<p>I watched him manipulate the stars into weird patterns.  They rotated around the sky as he &#8220;read&#8221; them.  I tried to read them too, but I didn&#8217;t get it.  Unfortunately, I had been lucid for an extremely long time at this point (perhaps 15 minutes), and my lucidity started to fade.</p>
<p>While he was manipulating the stars, a women offered us some food samples.  Cakes, brownies, and chocolates, and stuff like that.  At first I said no, because I wanted to only eat healthy food, but then I realized it was ok because it was a dream.  While eating the food, I became distracted, and lost my lucidity.  After that, myself and the shaman forgot about the stars, and got stuck in these narrow tubes in the yard.  Lucidity was gone, and I forgot about my lottery goal.  No results.  <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I find that my dream characters are worthless when it comes to usable information.  In the past, I have asked them for help on different topics, and they always fail to provide anything substantial.  I remember one time, while lucid, I decided to track down a &#8220;psychokinetic master&#8221; and ask him techniques.  When I found him, and asked him, all he gave me was a simple chakra meditation.  Another time, I was lucid and asked to speak to my subconscious.  A man walked up to me, but it quickly turned into helping someone with a drug addiction (that doesn&#8217;t exist).  Another time I also asked to speak to my subconscious -  the receptionist told me I&#8217;d have to call him.  After finally getting a hold of my subconscious on the phone after some trickery, nothing was beneficial.</p>
<p>And most of the time in my dreams, all the dream characters do is try to convince me I&#8217;m not dreaming.  What a waste.  I&#8217;m lucid - I know I&#8217;m dreaming.</p>
<p>I also asked about the lottery when I first started playing.  My dream gave me numbers&#8230;. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3.  Needless to say, they didn&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>I wonder how people have precognitive dreams.  While my dreams are fun and useful in self-discovery, they always fail at helping figure out things about reality.</p>
<p>Bah.</p>

			<p>Yeah I&#8217;ve also wondered how people had precognitive dreams. I&#8217;ve had them since I was very young (earliest I remember is age 6 or 7), but never anything important. But it&#8217;s a scary feeling when the event happens, like &#8220;What? Didn&#8217;t I do this already&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know how people control it, it&#8217;s always just been random to me and usually only meaningless events, but usually they&#8217;re long and extremely detailed. I recalled having precog of a documentary on something I&#8217;d never heard of before when I was young. Even feeling entire days being done before, going all day long knowing everything that&#8217;s coming up, but it&#8217;s always  blurry when you recall it. I suppose for people who just naturally get precognitive dreams, good dream recall would help. Very interesting topic in my opinion.</p>

			<p>bigfoot, that happens to me too. I&#8217;ve had a dream and in a month or so had the experience. Sometimes I would now what would happen once I realized I had this experience before. Sometimes I tried breaking the precog (I knew what was supposed to happen and I changed it). It was never more than 30 seconds.</p>

			<p>sean.. i dont mean to sound like a smartass.. but i wouldn&#8217;t rely on the people in your dreams.. ive spoke to the people in my dreams before.. all they are there for is to make your dream look more like real life.. you might as well talk to a stone <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . my guess is that when you were following that &#8220;shaman&#8221; that your dream was stalling because you really dont know the answer.. since you dont know, the people in your dream dont know.. and since you thought a shaman would know the answer, the shaman acted out the role as he did know, but since he really didn&#8217;t the dream would have continued following the fasle shaman until you woke up.. of course thats all in my opinion.. feel free to try again if you think otherwise.. sorry for the long &#8220;comment&#8221; but i think its better than 50 small ones <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve only had one precognitive dream, I was six (I think) and I dreamt that I was on a boat with my family&#8230; It was at a lake, beautiful lake&#8230; Anyway, the dream lasted for about a week in dream days, and three weeks later my family decided to go for a trip on a houseboat to a nearby lake&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t nearly as fun as it could have been (I saw everything coming up, but couldn&#8217;t really put my finger on it until it happened, it was really weird.  Maybe that&#8217;s so I don&#8217;t have a chance to change how it happened in my precognitive dream?  Also brings up the question of whether we are all really free willed people)&#8230;  Anyway by the end of the trip I was thoroughly freaked out and nobody believed me&#8230; But that one dream, I believe at least, is the whole reason I&#8217;m here today, typing this comment.  </p>
<p>Man typing this has been a trip to the past&#8230; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;ma try to have an OBE tonight.  Maybe it will happen, it has got to sometime. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>P.S. On that boat trip, my cousin and I were playing a game of War (card game)&#8230;  We got &#8220;war&#8221; (drew the same ranking card out of the deck at the same time) I think seven times in a row&#8230; I knew it happened in my dream and that&#8217;s the thing that made me think it was only a dream.  After that happened, that one point, in real life&#8230; That was the single thing that started me into the paranormal, because I knew there was absolutely no way I could have known that was going to happen.  And I&#8217;m glad I did.  I&#8217;ve met some good people <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>eating the food was probably a mistake.  food grounds us after all, even in dreams.  I have a lot of precognitive dreams. Many of them occur in symbols.</p>

			<p>Dude i have experienced this before, your dreams are what you make them, you can&#8217;t learn anything new about yourself if you already know you don&#8217;t know it. Trust me that makes sense. Anyways, next time, when your lucid try this, or just read it and your subconscious mind will do it for, understand? Good. Now i am going to give you a very useful technique naturally you might find it easy to do this on your first time, but keep trying. </p>
<p>Your lucid, and you imagine a mirror, look at yourself through that mirror and see blackness, now step into that blackness, and out of your body, from there it gets spiritual, but you can find most answers there. Just try calling out for your guide, forget talking to yourself, this is the place to find your answers. </p>
<p>The chances of you finding the lottery numbers while there, is impossible, seriously it is the land of thoughts your not the only one with influence when your there. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not pushing anything on you i am giving you an alternative to getting answers, once you step through that mirror and out of your body you will begin to immediatly realize your expectations of most things you want answered, there you can ask for a psychokinetic master, and he may help you. </p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t do this techique to leave your body,  another simpler method is to begin to fly when your dreaming, fly upwards, until your out. </p>
<p>Anyways thanks for your time mate, and cheers to you.</p>

			<p>Wanting only creates..exactly that.. more wanting.. you know this.. when you ask for something, youre affirming that you dont have it. You probably know this already.. just dont forget to apply it.  Id like to talk to you more in depth sometime, i shot you an email ealier.</p>

<p>Maybe you should change the way your thinking of it. If they say your not dreaming listen to them and don&#8217;t think of it as a dream.<br />
Who knows it might help.<br />
Yay i had a constuctive though! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>I think that maybe you are trying to get your answer in the wrong fashion. I would probably make the lottery machine in my dream, as it looks in the real world. Then i would let it roll and create results instead of asking for them. The subconscious would be forced to act&#8230; i think.</p>
<p>Good luck if you try again anyways. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p>i have an idea, maybe if you tried to trick your dream people into telling you where they thought the subconscious is, then you might find it. like you said before to trick it into telling you things. or maybe something like that. Idk, it is just a theory.</p>
