		<description>"I find that my dream characters are worthless when it comes to usable information. In the past, I have asked them for help on different topics, and they always fail to provide anything substantial."

i have an idea, maybe if you tried to trick your dream people into telling you where they thought the subconscious is, then you might find it. like you said before to trick it into telling you things. or maybe something like that. Idk, it is just a theory.</description>

		<description>I think that maybe you are trying to get your answer in the wrong fashion. I would probably make the lottery machine in my dream, as it looks in the real world. Then i would let it roll and create results instead of asking for them. The subconscious would be forced to act... i think.

Good luck if you try again anyways. :D</description>

		<description>"And most of the time in my dreams, all the dream characters do is try to convince me I’m not dreaming. What a waste. I’m lucid - I know I’m dreaming."

Maybe you should change the way your thinking of it. If they say your not dreaming listen to them and don't think of it as a dream.
Who knows it might help.
Yay i had a constuctive though! :D</description>

		<description>Wanting only creates..exactly that.. more wanting.. you know this.. when you ask for something, youre affirming that you dont have it. You probably know this already.. just dont forget to apply it.  Id like to talk to you more in depth sometime, i shot you an email ealier.</description>

		<description>Dude i have experienced this before, your dreams are what you make them, you can't learn anything new about yourself if you already know you don't know it. Trust me that makes sense. Anyways, next time, when your lucid try this, or just read it and your subconscious mind will do it for, understand? Good. Now i am going to give you a very useful technique naturally you might find it easy to do this on your first time, but keep trying. 

Your lucid, and you imagine a mirror, look at yourself through that mirror and see blackness, now step into that blackness, and out of your body, from there it gets spiritual, but you can find most answers there. Just try calling out for your guide, forget talking to yourself, this is the place to find your answers. 

The chances of you finding the lottery numbers while there, is impossible, seriously it is the land of thoughts your not the only one with influence when your there. 

I'm not pushing anything on you i am giving you an alternative to getting answers, once you step through that mirror and out of your body you will begin to immediatly realize your expectations of most things you want answered, there you can ask for a psychokinetic master, and he may help you. 

If you can't do this techique to leave your body,  another simpler method is to begin to fly when your dreaming, fly upwards, until your out. 

Anyways thanks for your time mate, and cheers to you.</description>

		<description>eating the food was probably a mistake.  food grounds us after all, even in dreams.  I have a lot of precognitive dreams. Many of them occur in symbols.</description>

		<description>I've only had one precognitive dream, I was six (I think) and I dreamt that I was on a boat with my family... It was at a lake, beautiful lake... Anyway, the dream lasted for about a week in dream days, and three weeks later my family decided to go for a trip on a houseboat to a nearby lake... It wasn't nearly as fun as it could have been (I saw everything coming up, but couldn't really put my finger on it until it happened, it was really weird.  Maybe that's so I don't have a chance to change how it happened in my precognitive dream?  Also brings up the question of whether we are all really free willed people)...  Anyway by the end of the trip I was thoroughly freaked out and nobody believed me... But that one dream, I believe at least, is the whole reason I'm here today, typing this comment.  

Man typing this has been a trip to the past... :-P I'ma try to have an OBE tonight.  Maybe it will happen, it has got to sometime. :-)

P.S. On that boat trip, my cousin and I were playing a game of War (card game)...  We got "war" (drew the same ranking card out of the deck at the same time) I think seven times in a row... I knew it happened in my dream and that's the thing that made me think it was only a dream.  After that happened, that one point, in real life... That was the single thing that started me into the paranormal, because I knew there was absolutely no way I could have known that was going to happen.  And I'm glad I did.  I've met some good people ;-)</description>

		<description>sean.. i dont mean to sound like a smartass.. but i wouldn't rely on the people in your dreams.. ive spoke to the people in my dreams before.. all they are there for is to make your dream look more like real life.. you might as well talk to a stone :) . my guess is that when you were following that "shaman" that your dream was stalling because you really dont know the answer.. since you dont know, the people in your dream dont know.. and since you thought a shaman would know the answer, the shaman acted out the role as he did know, but since he really didn't the dream would have continued following the fasle shaman until you woke up.. of course thats all in my opinion.. feel free to try again if you think otherwise.. sorry for the long "comment" but i think its better than 50 small ones :D</description>
