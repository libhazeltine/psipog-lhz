By Law of Attraction, I mean simply believing things (very specific things, even) will happen to you actually makes them happen.<br />
Now, at first it seemed very far fetched to me. But then I realized that the past year I&#039;ve had a very negative point of view on everything, and things haven&#039;t been going well for me.<br />
I also connected this with my telepathy practices. Do I not will myself to send a message or image from my mind to someone elses? Must you not believe for telepathy or any psi practice to be successful? Although, the Law of Attraction never mentions having a connection to psi whatsoever.<br />
I also wonder whether or not it is simply changing your viewpoint so you perceive things positively.</div>

		<div id="post_16062" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I would like to present something I was taught at my university if I could, that definitely supports the proposed theory in many ways.  <br />
<br />
It is the &quot;Sapir-Whorf&quot; hypothesis; a key point of linguistic relativity.  It, very simply put, states that words will create one&#039;s reality (e.g. if you say you are stupid, you will be much more inclined to act in stupid ways).  In what ways they create one&#039;s reality, or if they do at all, is highly debated.  Although I&#039;m going to present it to you as it was presented to me in my course, it would be wise to do your own research on the topic.  I wouldn&#039;t suggest Wikipedia, but rather scholarly, peer-reviewed articles for your research.  Trust me guys, you will see a difference O_O<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start out with a study performed on a group of kindergarten students.  The teachers and parents were instructed not to teach the word &quot;Bored&quot; to the children and not to use it around them ever.   Being that the word didn&#039;t exist to those children, they never got bored.  My professor stated that rather than just sitting down and saying &quot;I&#039;m bored&quot;, they went and found something to do.  At the end of the study, the teachers and parents were instructed to explain the word &quot;Bored&quot; to the children, and thus after the children started getting lazier and even sat and said &quot;I&#039;m bored&quot; rather than finding something to do like they used to.  They didn&#039;t know the word bored, so they didn&#039;t know the concept of boredom and furthermore they didn&#039;t get bored (until the concept was learned)!<br />
<br />
Linguistic relativity, as it relates to behavioral sciences and psychology, often states that one creates their identity with what words they use to describe themselves, especially to their peers or primary social group.  In your case, telling yourself (and others about yourself) that you have a very negative point of view on everything (like you used to) would make you much more inclined to have a negative point of view on everything, while telling yourself &quot;I have a very positive view on everything&quot; would have the opposite effect.  In the children&#039;s cases, their immediate reality was effected just by not knowing, then learning, the word &quot;bored&quot;.<br />
<br />
Linguistic relativity is similar to the theory of thoughts creating one&#039;s reality (cognitive relativity?), however due to thoughts being subjective, it is even more difficult to test than linguistic relativity is.  However, words are projected thoughts, so in non-materialistic way, this would support some theories stating that thoughts create one&#039;s reality, which is primarily what that &quot;The Secret&quot; book tries to get it, which is a derivative of or from your &quot;Law of Attraction&quot; theory there :)<br />

@Lee:<br />
Well Lee buddy, I&#039;m not sure how what I&#039;m about to say applies to your practice of psionics, but I know in order for someone&#039;s workout/strength training/muscle building/weight loss routine to work, they have to believe it works.  In order for addiction therapy to work, it&#039;s participants must believe it is going to work.  In any kind of training for anything, one must believe that their training methods are going to work, so wouldn&#039;t it be safe to assume that if one practices psionics and expects it to work, one must believe that the psionic methods or trainig must work?<br />
<br />
I hope those of you that actually read my long post here received something stimulating in some way :)</div>

		<div id="post_16066" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The law of attraction has been around for a while, and its used by almost every metaphysical group or archetype.<br />
<br />
Its used by the Wiccans as spells; Psions, Reiki, Ki, and Qi Gong practitioners as mental to physical manifestations;  And by a bunch of hypnotists and soccer-moms on a website called Psitek.net.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I do think that there is something about the law of attraction.  Where the mind goes the energy flows, right?  ;p<br />
But I don&#039;t think its quite as limitless as they make it seem..  After all, I haven&#039;t seen any flying soccer moms or teleporting Ki users.   But then again, it could be a person to person kind of thing.   You never /really/ know, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
As a side note; I find that the spells in Wiccan practice to be a tad more effective than daydreaming about what you want like other LoA people say.   Probably because theres a lot of subconscious triggers like chanting, lighting candles, and praying to gods and goddesses.   Not saying those things are real, but they work pretty well.  ;p</div>

Now that you have this idea, when you remember back to that time things will seem to you that they happened this way because you were negative.<br />

As a side note; I find that the spells in Wiccan practice to be a tad more effective than daydreaming about what you want like other LoA people say.

The law of attraction has been around for a while, and its used by almost every metaphysical group or archetype.

Its used by the Wiccans as spells; Psions, Reiki, Ki, and Qi Gong practitioners as mental to physical manifestations;  And by a bunch of hypnotists and soccer-moms on a website called Psitek.net.

In my opinion, the probability of clashes is quite low, since there are many possibilities for solving these problems and usually there aren&#039;t hordes of people wishing for the exact opposite to your wish. War could be an exception though.<br />
