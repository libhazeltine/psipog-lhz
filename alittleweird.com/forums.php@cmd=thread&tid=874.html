		<div id="post_15708" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Alright, guys, let&#039;s talk synesthesia.<br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t know, here&#039;s a quick description:<br />
<br />
Synesthesia allows a person to perceive sensory signals differently. Usually, they perceive them visually, meaning they can see sounds, odors, etc. Some would also smell them, etc. Since synesthetes - those with synesthesia - have such a perception of reality, they can sometimes visualize abstract concepts like time with a different perspective. One good example I read about seeing time as a three-dimensional thing, with different points being different times, etc. They could also see a certain time as &quot;closer&quot; than another that might be &quot;further&quot; as if it were a spatial thing. They also tend to give (and see, from what I understand) colors to different letters, shapes and numbers. (All that&#039;s what I could understand; I didn&#039;t read much about it, just a quick paragraph here and there)<br />
<br />
So I was wondering if any of you ever heard of this? It&#039;s new to me, anyway, but from what I&#039;ve seen, it&#039;s been researched quite a bit. Let&#039;s see what we can dig up, yeah?<br />
<br />
And what if we can induce it? This is ALW after all. I think it&#039;s pretty much a native talent some people have, but you never know... :P<br />
<br />
This guy named Cretien van Campen, from the Netherlands, says you can become aware of synethesia in his text <em>The Hidden Sense: Becoming aware of Synethesia</em><br />
<br />
Here, let me quote him:<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;"><em>Cretien van Campen, The Hidden Sense: Becoming aware of Synethesia</em><br />
<br />
Can you become aware of synesthesia? Yes indeed, though it may take a long time and a lot of concentration. You have to learn without examples, because synesthesia is personal, and there is no educational program available to help you. You will have to find it all by yourself. You cannot imitate another synesthete or follow his or her suggestions, either.</div>For the full text: home.comcast.net/~sean.day/vanCampen2009.pdf<br />
<br />
EDIT: When I was little, I remember one day asking my mom &quot;What&#039;s the color for B?&quot; When she asked me why, I showed her a drawing I had made of all the different letters each with a different color. It&#039;s not something I had thought about for long; I just wrote them down in the color I felt was right. Red for A, Z remained black, etc. B ended up as brown, probably just a coincidence, but maybe it had something to do with synesthesia.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: I just read the numbers are estimated at 4% of the human population.</div>

Having a fast metabolism rocks: you don&#039;t gain weight and you can lose it quickly =D<br />
<br />
But really now, most foods don&#039;t have much of a taste; that&#039;s why we use spices, salt, etc. But the spices add to the aroma, not the taste. So we&#039;re smelling the food more than tasting it.</div>
