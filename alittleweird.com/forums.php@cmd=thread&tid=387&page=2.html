I have a weird question for everybody. If your mentally not there(off in space or in deep thought, not being aware of your surroundings), Could you theoretically physically not be seen and be unaware that you&#039;re &quot;invisible&quot;? Whether you&#039;re blending in with the crowd or actually subconsciously using psi power to turn invisible.<br />

<br />
honestly, without using psi as a medium, all I have to do it putforth absolutely no intent to be noticed, and I am invisible. The reason why the intent of &quot; I am invisible&quot; doesn&#039;t or wouldn&#039;t work in this scenario is because saying a I&#039;m invisible is drawing attention to yourself in some way. The beuty of this method is that it cannot be detected by another psion. With an &quot;invisibility shield&quot; you have all mediums covored except the fact that there is a shiel up for it.<br />

<br />
I spent quite some time debating with someone about how true invisibility would work back in the days of psipog. I no longer disagree with this person and have accepted it along with my own theory for how true invisibility may work.<br />
<br />
The way I see it is that true invisibility might possibly be obtained in one of two ways:<br />
<br />
1. The person changes the resonance of his/her atoms so that photons (light particles) are able to pass through his/her body. I very much doubt that changing one&#039;s atomic resonsance would even yield this result, but it&#039;s probably worth thinking about at least.<br />
<br />
2. The person manipulates photons (preferably with a construct) so that they bend around, rather than hit and bounce off of, the person&#039;s body and bounce off of a (visible or invisible) &quot;substance&quot; located behind the person&#039;s body where they again bend around the person&#039;s body and enter the observer&#039;s eyes.<br />
<br />
The latter may seem a little complicated without a visual representation for some, so here is a more simplified explanation:<br />
<br />
The light rays simply &quot;avoid&quot; the person, go behind that person, bounce off of something, and &quot;avoid&quot; the person on the way back to the observer&#039;s eyes. The result is that the observer sees the imagery behind the person and not the actual person since the light does not touch him/her.<br />
<br />
The theory just described definitely seems very possible to me, while the other theory probably has less than a 1% chance of yielding any positive results.<br />

It is surprising to see how many people do not bother to think about the possibilities and include inclusive words, such as &quot;he/she&quot;, &quot;his or her&quot;, &quot;him/her&quot;, etc.

I rarely see differences between members of the two genders online (except when you are dealing with people who use colloquialisms and other poor language habits often).

It goes to show you that there are not as many differences between the two genders as many would have us believe.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

&quot;The light rays simply &quot;avoid&quot; the person, go behind that person, bounce off of something, and &quot;avoid&quot; the person on the way back to the observer&#039;s eyes. The result is that the observer sees the imagery behind the person and not the actual person since the light does not touch him/her.&quot;<br />
<br />
... Doesn&#039;t this mean the person causing it to happen wouldn&#039;t be able to see anything? If all the light coming at him or her is bent around the construct, surely it would also prevent it from reaching the psion&#039;s eyes? This is just speculation, of course. You may correct me if I am wrong. =P I&#039;m not sure my constructs are that advanced anyway.

However, if you want to be invisible, you should program your construct to let light from behind you (OUTCOMING) bend arround you and go to the other, and not letting the light that touches you bounce back.<br />

It&#039;s not that I&#039;m unsure that changing one&#039;s atomic resonance wouldn&#039;t produce the desired result; it&#039;s more that I cannot even conceive how much skill that would take to do. And how dangerous it might be. Bending light is one thing, but changing the way your own particles are... strikes me as a little foolish. On par with trying to induce phasing, in fact. Still, if people are crazy enough to want to try, I won&#039;t stop them. In my experience, if you can deflect people&#039;s attention from you then you don&#039;t *need* to be invisible. =)</div>

I can actually see where you are going with that approach. I don&#039;t actually *know* the process that makes me able to perform PK, yet I manage to do it anyway, simply by willing it to happen.
