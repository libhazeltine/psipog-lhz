1. Meditate.  Learn to shut your mind up.  Think of nothing for as long as you can.  Really DO THIS.  Don&#039;t skip this step.<br />

--- NOW:<br />
<br />
2. Since at this point, you can shut your mind up on command, ask yourself a question - then shut your mind up!  Listen.<br />
<br />
Most likely you won&#039;t hear a &quot;voice&quot; or anything... you&#039;ll most likely feel an emotional response to the question.  If you want to dissect this emotion, then you might want to translate it into words (this is what I normally do).  Or you can just digest the emotion directly, which I do sometimes as well.<br />

		<div id="post_9955" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Training with your subconscious is a good idea!!!<br />
The best thing you can do in order to create a clear connection with your subconcious is to realize that it is not some mystical being that is seperate of you, but inside of you - - - it is YOU.  <br />
<br />
Your subconscious is the part of your mind that takes in information from everything and learns from your environment.  It learns from your experiences, as well as experiences it observes from other people, as well as everything else your environment includes.  Your subconscious wants you to become the best YOU possible, and it bases what&#039;s &quot;best&quot; for you on what it observes within your environment and what you experience.<br />
<br />
If you are doing something your subconscious believes isn&#039;t good for you, it will work against your decision, or simply not give you its full support; it creates a division within your mind.  Abraham Lincoln said &quot;A house divided upon itself cannot stand,&quot; likewise the house of &quot;YOU&quot; cannot function if you aren&#039;t in union with your subconscious.  In order to function with your subconscious, you must realize that not everything you WANT will make you become the best YOU possible.<br />
<br />
Your subconscious is not meant to be depended on.<br />
<br />
On psipog I remember reading that the subconscious is like an unexercised muscle.  It&#039;s there, it is just weaker cuz you don&#039;t always use it.  I found this similar to your abdominal muscles (your abs).  Our abs are not always visible, but they are there every day.  Not everyone exercises their abs, not everyone needs to, but the people that do can tell you that when your abs are stronger, you are able to draw muscular support from them to help you run, jump, etc.  You can probably already see how your abs are similar to your abs.  What can we learn from that? <br />
<br />
Can we move, run, etc, with only our abs?  No, our abs are not meant to be soley depended on and likewise our subconscious is not meant to be soley depended on.  Just as it takes a union of muscles within our body to make us function at optimal performance, it takes a union within our mind to make us function at optimal performance.  <br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
<img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h136/savemydonkey/FOTO.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
What does this have to do with anything in this thread?<br />
When you use your subconscious to help you get answers on your test, you are putting a lot of dependence/responsibility on your subconscious.  Doing that here and there, especially in emergency situations, is fine and I&#039;m sure your subconcious thinks the same way.  However, doing it for every test won&#039;t help you exercise your memory, your ability to pay attention in class, your ability to be more responsible, etc, it will weaken you.  <br />
<br />
Usually your subconscious has already learned that from your environment and probably won&#039;t help you on tests all the time.  Why? Because it doesn&#039;t want to weaken your mind, it wants you to become the best you possible and you should want you to become the best you possible too.  <br />
<br />
When you are working towards making yourself the best you possible and actually exercising your mental and physical capacity, your are doing what your subconscious wants.  It is easier to communicate with your subconscious through union than resistence.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9955">Training with your subconscious is a good idea!!!
The best thing you can do in order to create a clear connection with your subconcious is to realize that it is not some mystical being that is seperate of you, but inside of you - - - it is YOU.  

Your subconscious is the part of your mind that takes in information from everything and learns from your environment.  It learns from your experiences, as well as experiences it observes from other people, as well as everything else your environment includes.  Your subconscious wants you to become the best YOU possible, and it bases what&#039;s &quot;best&quot; for you on what it observes within your environment and what you experience.

If you are doing something your subconscious believes isn&#039;t good for you, it will work against your decision, or simply not give you its full support; it creates a division within your mind.  Abraham Lincoln said &quot;A house divided upon itself cannot stand,&quot; likewise the house of &quot;YOU&quot; cannot function if you aren&#039;t in union with your subconscious.  In order to function with your subconscious, you must realize that not everything you WANT will make you become the best YOU possible.

Your subconscious is not meant to be depended on.

On psipog I remember reading that the subconscious is like an unexercised muscle.  It&#039;s there, it is just weaker cuz you don&#039;t always use it.  I found this similar to your abdominal muscles (your abs).  Our abs are not always visible, but they are there every day.  Not everyone exercises their abs, not everyone needs to, but the people that do can tell you that when your abs are stronger, you are able to draw muscular support from them to help you run, jump, etc.  You can probably already see how your abs are similar to your abs.  What can we learn from that? 

Can we move, run, etc, with only our abs?  No, our abs are not meant to be soley depended on and likewise our subconscious is not meant to be soley depended on.  Just as it takes a union of muscles within our body to make us function at optimal performance, it takes a union within our mind to make us function at optimal performance.

What does this have to do with anything in this thread?
