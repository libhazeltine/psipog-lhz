I&#039;m still realitively new to this whole thing as well but I wouldn&#039;t put to much stock in the actual existance of the skinwalker as the myths make them out to be. Although the Navajo believed they could read thoughts and what not, so it does have some psionic reference, but it&#039;s still pretty vague.

		<div id="post_9588" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">A lot of cultures have a history of having some sort of were-creature, weather it be by choice or as a form of punishment. These cultures, to which contact would have been impossible (at the time), all have similar stories and legends. To some people, this almost proves the existence of these were-creatures, but like aliens, the existence has never been proven (or the government has completely covered it up ^_* ). I haven&#039;t seen were-creatures mentioned much in psionic communities much.<br />
<br />
I believe that shapeshifting is completely possible, it being one of the reasons that I got into psionics originally. But, to be able to shape shift completely to an animal, it would take a lot of training (for most people) but I&#039;m sure there are people out there who are better at it. There are probably people that can shapeshift easier than others, but I doubt that there are complete &quot;skinwalkers&quot; who have never needed any training.<br />
<br />
There are a few methods to change your eye color with psionics, which is considered one of the first steps towards shapeshifting. I wouldn&#039;t advise googling shapeshifting though, you will find many sources that are a bit... sketchy at best.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped!<br />

do u (bd333) have any specific techniques to change eye color? articles or something?</div>Yay! A quote button!!!<br />
<br />
Anyways, these are three techniques that I have heard of that are used for changing eye color.<br />
<br />
The first is just true belief. When ever you look in a mirror or see your reflection, you must think something like &quot;my eyes are (insert color here)&quot;. It is very important to always, when thinking about your eye color, think of them as the new color. It may sound crazy but it works. This process took about a week of belief before having any results. <br />
<br />
Another technique I have heard of to change eye color is as you are falling asleep, when you reach the point just before you are asleep, see yourself with the eye color you want and then make yourself (with the new eye color) merge with yourself. Know that your eye color has changed. This is *apparently* one of the techniques used for shape shifting too.<br />
<br />
I have one more technique; it may not give physical results all the time, but it has the same effect. Sit and visualize the color that your eyes are currently. Do that for a while. Then slowly visualize the color that you want your eyes to be take over the normal color. Know that your eyes are changing. Visualize the new color completely taking over your old color. Do this until you know that your eyes are changed. Try this a few times. The more you do it, the more effective it is. What this does is it tricks people into thinking that your eyes are a certain color. People who know you well may not be effected but people who don&#039;t know you as well should see the color that you want. <br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll try to find sources (with the full, detailed articles), but I can&#039;t remember what sites I got the information from. If you have questions, just ask!<br />

It is very important to always, when thinking about your eye color, think of them as the new color. It may sound crazy but it works. This process took about a week of belief before having any results.[/quote]

One thing I will note though is that you could probably use psionics to trick other people&#039;s minds into thinking that you are the animal (much like psychic invisibility).<br />

Another technique I have heard of to change eye color is as you are falling asleep, when you reach the point just before you are asleep, see yourself with the eye color you want and then make yourself (with the new eye color) merge with yourself. Know that your eye color has changed. This is *apparently* one of the techniques used for shape shifting too.~Bobby</div>weird i had a experience like that about a week ago.<br />
i posted about it on the weirdest experiences thread. my aura is shaped different now but as for physical affects, i only have a thin layer of new white hairs growing on my body and i think my teeth got harder but i&#039;m not sure. I think shapeshifting, if full shifting is possible, would take alot of time to take affect, say months or maybe longer. Mainly my shift is mental/behavioral as i have become more aware of my surroundings since the shift if you want to call it that.<br />
Hope this gives somemore info :)</div>

		<div id="post_9729" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It depends on the energy you use to do it.<br />
<br />
If you think of the line of transformation as a slope between energy and time, Then the less time that you want to take the more energy you have to direct at the change. If it&#039;s less energy, then it will take more time to take affect.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s easier if you have a link to the creature you are changing into. If I want, I can increase canines, my sensitivity, and etc. by &quot;merging&quot; with my spirit animal. FYI, I live near Indian reservations so this is a popular ideal among friends (one of which is half Chippewa Indian, the other a local coven member of high ranking, one an atheist with a ghost obsession, one&#039;s a natural at light manipulation, and then myself, who is the Psion of the group...yeah... I have that much luck to hang out with these people ^_^)</div>
