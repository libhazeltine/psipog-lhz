		<div id="post_14122" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I have had numorous occassions where something strange happens in your dream. Allthough I made this thread to note the scientific explanations in a nutshell without trying to predict the psychic backgrounds.<br />
The strange things that you might recognize<br />
<br />
1: You have had the same dream, usually nightmare as someone else in your house.<br />
<br />
2: You are drowning, then you try to breath and you seem to be able to get oxygen underwater.<br />
<br />
3: Your dream is suddenly cut off with the feeling that your falling down, almost as soon as you are aware you panically kick your legs and arms around in your bed as if you are being tazed or electrified, then you wake up in a rather unpleasant way: &lt;- When you fall back asleep this will usually happen again!, and you will wake up more unpleasant every time.<br />
<br />
4: Your consciousness seems to have full control over your dream, Usually you will wake up in this state. But you don&#039;t wake up, insteed you try to maintain your sleeping phase... This can occur for a couple of seconds up to half a minute in my longest case.<br />
<br />
5: You wake up, but Wait!!!... You don&#039;t, You can&#039;t move... Its very dark... Your getting hot, your heartbeat rises... You are terrified.<br />
You wait about 5 more seconds and at that point your senses seem to be active and you wake up sweaty. 180 bpm and eyes wide open.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have talked to people about this and most are familiar with point 1 to 4, noteworthy point 3; I haven&#039;t talked to someone who is not familiar with that one.<br />
<br />
Point 5 on the otherhand, only few people I talked to are familair with it and trust me you don&#039;t want to know, its a really rare occasion. I have read article&#039;s about it stating that from the sleeping state to the normal state usually activate&#039;s the consciousness and the senses aswell. But it can activate the consciousness... But doesn&#039;t activate the smell, sight, feeling, and muscle contraction that is usually activated. Not only I have witnessed that it is not a pleasant feeling.</div>

Have you ever  forgot about something that happend in your sleep in an instance. And you find it weird because you where just thinking about it seconds ago just after you woke up.<br />
<br />
My theory is that when dreams are fascinating or &#039;cool&#039; you tend to intensively think about it. When you think about something in reality you can usually remember it in detail. But dreams are erased shortly after you wake up, therefore when a dream is scary or completely boring your mind will usually remove it completely ( unless you think about it shortly after.)<br />
<br />
Everytime &quot;we&quot; humans go to sleep, but also animals like my dog. We dream, there is not a single time our minds are idle when we sleep. We had thousands of dreams in our lives already. But when you think back of it you can only remember 4 or 5... Well at least in my case. Its fortunate though I don&#039;t think I would want to remember all the bullcrap.</div>
