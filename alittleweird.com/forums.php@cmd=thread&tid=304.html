<br />
About a month ago, while I was sleeping a very strange event happened.  I opened my eyes, and I was laying in bed, but unable to move. (sleep paralysis, I am assuming) This happens to me way too often, but this time it was different.<br />
<br />
I look up, and in front of my bed a figure is standing.  The figure is about 6 feet tall (1.8 meters) a very deep black color, huge white eyes, and no visible mouth, nose, ears, etc.  It also seemed like the figure was not solid, but instead was made up of energy.  The figure glances at the ground, and laughs.  I cannot hear the laugh, it was a silent laugh, but I somehow just know that it was laughing.  Then the figure looks up at me, and moves closer to me.  It does not &quot;move&quot; in the same way you or I do, but it was as though it was not limited by space/time, it could move from one place to another in the blink of an eye.  Then the figure holds me down, and I feel more paralyzed than just being &quot;paralyzed&quot;, if that makes any sense.  This whole time I am extremely terrified.  I feel like more happened after that, but I do not remember it.  Also, if it makes any difference, this was not night time, it was the middle of the day (I&#039;m nocturnal).<br />
<br />
I am not asking for someone to explain this, as I do not know if that is possible to do, but if you have any idea at all of what this could be please do tell me.  I have a few ideas myself, but I do not want to say so that I don&#039;t influence anyone else.<br />
<br />
I do not know if I was merely hallucinating, or if it was real, but I can say it felt very real indeed.<br />
<br />
Also, I have many other &quot;weird events&quot; that have happened throughout my life.  I will be sharing those later.</div>

You&#039;re halfway between sleep and reality, so sometimes what should be a dream appears to be real. The whole tall, dark figure standing over you and keeping you &quot;pinned down&quot; thing is common to a lot of people who suffer from this.<br />
<br />
There are prescription drugs you can get that eliminate the problem of sleep paralysis. If you don&#039;t want to have to deal with this sort of thing again, you shoudl probably get some of those.</div>

No way would I want to take drugs to suppress this.  Sure, it was extremely scary at the time, but it happens to me often, and by now I know it won&#039;t kill me.  (When I say happens often, I mean the paralysis, I have only seen this figure one time.)  Besides, I would like to meet this figure again, maybe learn more about it and try to find out if it is real or just a hallucination. Also the drugs could effect other things as well.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing I found, not sure if it is it or not:<br />
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism</a><br />
<br />
Scroll down to the part where it says &quot;However, one working definition of the term &#039;Luciferian&#039;, is one who has witnessed the a glowing being which has been witnessed pointing downward while laughing silently, looking up into the night sky.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was not night time, as I said, but other than that it does sound like the same being.  However, the Wikipedia article does not list a source for that sentence, and it does sound rather far fetched, but then again is there any better explanation?<br />
<br />
Also, one question to anyone else who has experienced sleep paralysis; while you are experiencing it, do you feel as though you are not as mentally alert as normal?  As though you are not as intelligent as normal, or something like that?  Hard to put into words what I am trying to ask.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div>

<br />
The being you are mentioning is not bound by 3rd dimensional laws of physics or even biological constraints. It seems to me like there are plenty of these beings roaming the 4th dimension.<br />
<br />
My own personal experience with sleep paralysis has been kind of different from yours. I experienced a similar being, laughing, but it was younger than I was ( I was 15 at the time) and it was playing with what looked like an extra copy of my blanket. Now, that may not sound menacing, but I was scared shitless. It kept making copies of my blanket and deleting the one it would get trapped under. I eventually was able to whisper &#039;get out&#039;, but that didnt seem to make things better. In an instant there were 3 of the beings. No more copies of the blanket. And i grew very cold. Then i woke up.<br />
<br />
Now, you dont have to believe my 4th dimension theories at all. But I do want to open your mind to some more possibilities. What lies in other dimensions? What are the boundaries of the fourth? and which dimension does the spirit go to. <br />
<br />
personally i think all beings start on the 4th<br />
come down to the third as a biological life form<br />
and die to be come a 2nd dimension ghostie. :) <br />
<br />
silly, yes. but sort of makes sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Vondur. I would say, try to go back into sleep paralysis, talk to the being(s) or try to. see if they will talk back, see if they will let you speak. <br />
<br />
everyone. please, i&#039;m asking you not to completely bash my theories, but instead inspect them with an open mind. and form your own opinion. ( not just hey dude u suck and r Retarded) <br />
<br />
kthx</div>

<br />
Ender2008 - I have a very open mind and will neither agree nor disagree with any theory that anyone puts before me.  Only through being able to prove or disprove it myself will I agree or disagree.<br />
<br />
I Actually was in sleep paralysis about a week ago, but it was just like normal, I did not see the being.  I would like to try to see it again, but I do not know how to make myself go into sleep paralysis.  Is there even a way to do that?  When I have tried to have an OBE before I have ended up in sleep paralysis.  Should I just try that?  The only problem is with this mental state I am trying to describe.  Several times I have said to myself &quot;Next time I am in sleep paralysis I should try to do x&quot; but I rarely can even remember that when I am actually in the sleep paralysis. <br />

Another thing; if you think there are 4th and 2nd dimensions, could there also be 1st, 5th, 6th, etc. as well?<br />

<br />
Where did that knowledge go? i think it is forever embedded into the subconscious. The entire human Genome is full of &quot;junk code&quot; that is seemingly useless to the human. But what if that code is that knowledge is what has been passed on from the tree of knowledge. <br />
<br />
where am i going with this rant? I believe the Subconscious knows everything. Why else can you condition it to do amazing &quot;psychic&quot; feats. Why else can I train it to practice telekinesis?<br />
<br />
When you asked your Sub-c what the meaning of existance was, i think it told you the truth. Now we have to interpret it. <br />
<br />
OK i&#039;m going to tie Vondur into this... so listen up.<br />
yes i believe there are more than the dimensions that i listed. there certainly can be a 1st 5th and 6th. and there probably are. But some things, I do believe were not made for us to understand, but to merely accept that they exist( part of why im doing so well at AP statistics) :) <br />
<br />
those other dimensions may be atomic placeholders or spiritual realms or even heaven or hell......Why are we here? to live a life and ascend ( or maybe descend hmmmmm) to another dimension. <br />
<br />
according to my previous post it would be descent into a lower dimension.<br />
<br />
But what happens when you reach 1 or even 0? well. I think that you start over, that you have an internal &quot;big Bang&quot; and become the highest form of energy in the highest dimension once again. ( i have constructed a theory on the highest dimension and its short lived pleasures if anyones interested) There is also the alternative as to where you create a Macro (large scale) big bang and create another universe ( which would parallel Michio Kaku&#039;s parallel universe theory)<br />
<br />
those are my ideas in a nutshell<br />
!~!!!~~~~~!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!<br />
<br />
Vondur keep trying your OBE and keep a sticky note somewhere that you will see if you wake in sleep paralysis (4th dimension) with instructions on what to do. I personally have had no problems with remembering what i needed to do, but then again my bouts with sleep paralysis were very very very long in duration and i often had time to panic and think about what was going on.<br />

thx for ur support and keep your mind open <br />

		<div id="post_7496" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Sounds like someone reads Graham Hancock.<br />
<br />
Hancock does mention in one interview I listened to, that reports of similar situations go throughout history. He claims that people were describing the common story of a creature standing over them unable to move before the rise of the alien abduction subculture. He also suggests that the stories that go back in history of such experiences are attributed to different mythological creatures such as elves(German folklore).<br />
<br />
Your event doesn&#039;t quite sound like the grey skin large black eyes thing. However I encountered something that sounds more to your creature while on a trip in Peru. I went down there in January to participate in an Ayahuasca ceremony and a number of us went for lunch and bounced different ideas off each other, exchanging reasons for why we came. One guy told the story of being a kid (around 5, one at around 23) and suffering from sleep paralysis. Steve was in his room, everything seemed normal but he couldn&#039;t move and he noticed a shadowy figure with a weird head. standing nearby and he freaked out. He went on to say that within the last few months before coming to peru he started seeing it again.<br />
<br />
He describes the sensation of being woken up out of a dream and this think standing on the bed over him. Its thin muscular leg touching his. He tells of it kinda falling backward and deflating, he trying to touch it but finding himself unable to move. Theres another one on the side of the bed over his girlfriend and he tries reaching for that one. She wakes up and finds him reaching across her and his eyes are open but hes unable to say or really move much. Then he says he wakes up in the same position but its gone.<br />
<br />
He mentions that he then had 2 experiences of wrestling with one of them and Yamo another guy on the trip butts in, Entity Attack. Yamo describes his experiences with a similar thing.. he&#039;d be really tired and before he&#039;d fall asleep one of these things would attack him. He recounted his struggle saying that once he took the stance of challenging it, it ran off. They both agree that fear makes it more powerful and Steve goes back into his experiences. He says during those two encounters he chases it down and wrestles with it, its struggling to get away and the Sophie wakes up to find him wrestling with nothing.<br />
<br />
His last one he describes being asleep and feeling like the light in the room has been turned on. So he opens his eyes and finds one on the side of the bed. He felt like it was stroking his hand but at the time thought it was some robber with a fetish. He thinks to himself the robber doesn&#039;t know hes awake so he&#039;ll get up and jump him, he does but the thing is just gone.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t actually looked into &quot;Entity attacks&quot; since I&#039;ve been back, but might be a term for you to start with.</div>
