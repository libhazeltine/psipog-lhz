<br />
I&#039;ve been doing mostly PK and lucid dreaming until now, and if I ever can, even if it&#039;ll take many years of training, I want to try making a Tulpa. But that means energy manipulation and then constructs, but I couldn&#039;t find anything that helps begin energy manipulation, so I was wondering if anyone&#039;s got a good one? I searched PsiPog but for some reason didn&#039;t find anything... If you know of something, let me know, please. (I&#039;ll look on Veritas, but if you have others, anything is appreciated.)<br />
<br />
Now back onto conscious constructs. I doubt it can take only 4 days to make one. It takes 9 months to create one <strong>with the help of a physical organ</strong> and then another one to sustain it. Imagine the amount of training required to create such a construct sustained only by psi? You&#039;ve said it yourself on your blog, sh, humans might just be a very complex form of construct.</div>

Don&#039;t forget to practice <em>correctly</em> as well, because practicing anything wrong can lead to poor results or even harm, depending on the skill. Correctly meaning, something that allows you make progress. Analyze what you just did, and think about how to change it to make it better. That last step usually takes guess-work, but that can be enjoyable, finding new things you can try. Something to keep you engaged. <br />
<br />
Oh, and feedback is also very important. &quot;Normal&quot; skills are different from psionics from the very start because you have a direct source of feedback. You can measure things usually from the beginning. Learning to throw a javelin? Lets see how far you toss it the first time, and measure how much you get better each throw. We&#039;ll need a measurement stick. Learning PK?(or any psionic skill). Well from the start, it&#039;s difficult to tell if progress is being made, because there is no feedback for a while (until the goal is met; you&#039;ve moved an object, made a psiball, whatever). We need a measuring stick. But how? My suggestion: Sensitivity. An analogy approaches. If you want to break into a metal safe, then would you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxY2wky6oZ4&amp;feature=fvw" target="_blank" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxY2wky6oZ4&amp;feature=fvw">hammer away</a> at the hinges until they break? Or listen to the tumblers (assuming you&#039;re trained in that sort of thing :P) and enter the right combo? Both achieve the same goal, getting the safe open. But one IS quicker. Of course you have to learn to listen to tumblers, and thus must learn sensitivity separately. You can approach sensitivity directly, without having to force your way to it through something else. <br />
<br />
So give it a try, there are articles all over that teach it.<br />
<br />
And no, I&#039;m not trained to break into safes :P .<br />

<br />
I&#039;ve been practicing energy manipulation for... about a week now I&#039;d say. 10-20 minutes a day. Yesterday (or the day before...?) I was standing at a bus stop and just looking straight ahead not focusing on anything when I slowly started seeing some kind of movement in the air. It was as if there was transparent smoke floating around all around, so I could only distinguish the movement, but still saw normally. I could clearly see that it was constantly moving. It happened again today. I&#039;m not sure what it is exactly, but when I try to focus and see it, I can&#039;t do it, but after I&#039;ve seen it without intending at first, then I can &quot;switch&quot; it on and off, but only to some extent; it never comes back as much as when I first get it.<br />
<br />
I mentioned the energy manip. &#039;cause I thought it might be related, but I think the chances for that are kinda slim.<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone before?</div>

To start off- psi balls, plain and simple. Make a couple a day, and do interesting things with them. Experiment, and above all, enjoy yourself.<br />

As for psi-balls , after getting bored with (unsuccessful) attempts at grounding ,I tried my hand at those and I like to believe that I succeeded a few times because sometimes I&#039;d get that feeling of a mild heat accumulating between my palms and one time when I was in bed with fever I managed to move the curtains of the window an inch or so.I tried the energy pooling exercise mentioned at the very start of the psi-pog manual but my sources were always temperature less which is probably why my psi-balls were weak.Any extra visualization tips(i.e from personal experience) for those?<br />

First, here&#039;s a sensitivity article:  <a href="http://www.psipog.net/art-sensitivity-manual.html" target="_blank">http://www.psipog.net/art-sensitivity-manual.html</a><br />
<br />
Second, I wouldn&#039;t say grounding is essential. There are a lot of people who strongly advocated it, but I never really ground before practicing, although I quasi-meditate a bit, which gives a similar effect.<br />
<br />
To ground, plant your feet on the ground, and try to feel any excess worry, tension or stress flow out of you and into the ground. <br />
<br />
As for psiballs, you don&#039;t necessarily need to concentrate on temperature. There are other sensations you can get from psi.<br />
<br />
For visualization tips, my advice would be to use as many senses as you possibly can. Try to see, hear, and feel the visualizations, and maybe smell too, if that works for you.<br />
