<br />
I&#039;m thinking that eventually we are going to advance in psionics in maybe lets say<br />
1000 years or something SO MUCH that we will have universal techniques, and be able to<br />
do the most ridiculous feats ever (like levitating our selfs, or sending really big<br />
things flying) and everyone will know about it. There won&#039;t be any &quot;skeptics&quot; because<br />
everyone will actually believe in it. So anyways, since it will be a skill almost as<br />
common as walking, aren&#039;t we going to eventually kill each other? I mean seriously, if<br />
we do manage to advance this far, aren&#039;t we be going to have wars in witch we send <br />
each other flying across the streets and make our heads smash into someone&#039;s windows,<br />
people remote viewing on others in their private moments, sucking our energy dry, etc.<br />
If we end up advancing that far...I swear were going to kill our selfs. This is why <br />
I&#039;m glad that we most likely will not advance that far anytime soon, I&#039;m also glad we<br />
do have skeptics because of this too. <br />
<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also another fear I have.<br />
Since we have skeptics now, what if lets say in the next 50 years,<br />
we advance enough so that we have universal techniques for things like PK<br />
and we are easily able to grow and advance in it...there probably still will<br />
be many skeptics, but there will probably be a lot more believers since we most<br />
likely will be able to do something beyond spinning a piece of stupid tin foil on<br />
a thumb tack, and maybe even dangerous. Like what if we could send a pencil flying at<br />
a fast enough speed to literally stab, and kill someone with it...<br />
<br />
The point that I&#039;m trying to get to is, eventually we are going to advance at least<br />
that far fairly soon, and eventually someone may use PK to deal physical harm to <br />
someone, so basically it&#039;s going to be the salem witch trails all over again,<br />
because obviously people are not going to be able to accept this, they will<br />
assume it as some sort of devils work of some sort...<br />

Perhaps in 1000 years Psi will be proven false, and we are just imagining it, and the future generation will just laugh and spit on us. <br />
Or maybe if it becomes widely known people will form a clan or something and try to kill all psi studiers. <br />
Or maybe our numbers will die out slowly, and eventually everyone and everything ever known about psi will be forgotten.<br />
There are so many possibilities, it&#039;s nearly impossible to know, we&#039;ll just have to wait 100 or too years to find out.<br />
<br />
The dealing physical harm thing, will come eventually, it&#039;s basically enevitable. If people master psi (or at least master what we know so far) then there will be some who use it for enjoyment, some for what we consider &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. What&#039;s going to happen will happen, because it&#039;s enevitable, worrying about it is useless.<br />
<br />
I ponder over these type of things many times, but my only conclusion is, we&#039;ll just have to wait and find out, because there is basically no way to know what will happen in the future.</div>

Guns, bombs. That kind of stuff. And it doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re all dead just yet. Of course, that might happen eventually, but I don&#039;t think adding psionic means to the equation would make that much difference. People who are capable of killing usually find a means to do it regardless. In addition, if we have advanced far enough in psionics for most people to be able to do some of the things you suggest, I would guess that most people would be capable of defending themselves via particularly strong shields etc.<br />
<br />
However, I do worry sometimes about your second point. I don&#039;t really want another Salem witch trials. But again, things have changed since then. I know for a fact that if I could prove beyond reasonable doubt to my friends what I&#039;m doing, they&#039;d jump at the chance to try it. Parapsychology as a whole is a lot more accepted in today&#039;s society, and it&#039;s not uncommon to hear a person confess they believe in telepathy/ghosts/precognition even if they&#039;ve never tried to do it properly themselves.<br />
<br />
However, I do feel this is a long way off and we don&#039;t really need to worry about it. Unless we as a group make some serious progress in the next few years. =P =)</div>
