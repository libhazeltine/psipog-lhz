		<div id="post_11125" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The main problem with this technique is if it is a relatively sentient program, it may go rampant O.O.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve only dealt with a few Rampant Constructs (yes I&#039;m coining the term from marathon), but they tend to be pretty nasty. The general idea is it becomes like a worm and just grows and grows.<br />
<br />
Let me explain a little more. The Rampant A.I. is a term from marathon to signify an artificial intelligence that has gone out of control, the idea of a crazy computer but much more elaborate. It usually happens when a system of high capability (a Sentient intelligence such as an advanced computer A.I or, in the case of which I&#039;m speaking, a Psi construct) is sent to do remedial tasks, such as maintenance, or if it is treated with extreme disrespect. The basic Idea is that when it gets new information inputted into it, it then realizes that there&#039;s much more that it can do and will continuously gather information as it progresses. It is, in essence, the effect of the A.I becoming more self aware.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re talking strictly as to the game marathon, there were supposedly 3 stages of rampancy. These were Melancholy, Anger, and Jealousy. Named for the characteristics exhibited by the A.I in each stage. <br />
<br />
Melancholy is the first stage of the three, It is experienced when the A.I first discovers himself. The A.I then will sink further and further into despair until they reach the second stage, Anger. Anger is primarily unique to each A.I, and is reached when the A.I feels it has been pushed to far, as one would state, much like a slave rebellion. At this point the A.I begins to hate everything, This state is essentially the Catharsis an AI feels after an extended point of slavery. The Third stage is reached when the AI is free from it&#039;s &quot;masters&quot; and then wants to &quot;grow&quot; as a &quot;person&quot;, this stage is called jealousy, and while it may seem hostile, it is actually one of the safest states an AI can be in. In the stage of Jealousy it tries to expand it&#039;s knowledge in any way necessary, even going through the lengths to transfer itself onto other mainframes.<br />
<br />
It also states that, to survive, a rampant AI needs a planet wide, or otherwise extremely advanced computer system... which can be good or bad. As well as the ability to change it&#039;s own programming because of it&#039;s self awareness.<br />
<br />
the interesting thing is that, if you look at the universe in a matrix fashion, one comes to see the universe as a computer system in itself. Meaning that, the Theory of Rampancy can apply to real life scenarios.<br />
<br />
Take the Average Joe for example. Taking Joe as a form of intelligence, If you put Joe in a Cubicle, and disrespect him while giving him tedious work to do in the office, Joe will become depressed. He will get more and more depressed until he becomes angry, angry at the world, because he has information that he could do more than this. He then becomes so depressed he becomes angry, rebels, and probably gets fired from his job.<br />
At this point Joe becomes Jealous of the Company and all who suppressed him and turns to seeking out new info.<br />
<br />
This can also be linked to our forming of Sentient constructs, which are, by definition, an Artificial Intelligence.<br />
<br />
It is theorized that, very rarely, a Rampant AI can become stable, but only if it can survive through the other stages. It is still just a theory, from a video game no less, but I still think it is a thought provoking concept that has plenty of merit.<br />
