		<div id="post_8476" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yes, electricity does give off an Aura, atleast in theory. A white Aura Symbolizes an &quot;out of Sync&quot; aura, It makes sense because the energy we gather to power our world today has been ripped from it&#039;s natural enviroment, taking it out of sync and making it give off a white aura. It could also mean that your tv is black...<br />
<br />
As for you Lain, I&#039;m sure it was, for the most part just a slight overtone of white, I see that alot lately, I think it Comes from the Stress of the people. when people feel a certain emotion, it will just Blaze out in the aura. I saw it in math class today, when people were presenting, Tims group went up. Everyone had a Turqoise auraexcept Tim, who had a green one. keep in mind the aura is not constant, it is a shifting thing. </div>

		<div id="post_8745" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So you have any calming music you like? if so, put it on during this excercise.<br />
<br />
Sit down, either in a chair or crosslegged on the floor. rest your hands comfortably on your lap, palms up, this is to help with realaxation (it has to do with anatomy i think, but I&#039;m not sure.<br />
<br />
close your eyes (or leave them open, you can keep reading this if you like), and take a deep breath, with that breath, feel the energy coming out from the floor filling your legs with warmth.<br />
<br />
breathing out, feel all stress, and other toxicity leave your body. <br />
<br />
Keep breathing slowely in and out, repeating the previous. Feel the energy coming out of the ground and filling your body up, and at the same time feel any negitivity leaving your body. let the energy fill you, engulf and surround you.<br />
<br />
when you feel filled up, take a few more breaths, and drift out of your concious world, and into the world of your mind. (I ussually see a forest clearing when I do this, and myself inside it.) If you find that you have company, try not to mind them, however; if you find them unsettling, you may ask them to leave, politely, if they don&#039;t, try not to let it bother you to much, but if it keeps reccurring, let me know.<br />
<br />
Let yourself become oriented for a while, relax, and breath. Just let your body relax, feel the energy within your body cleansing you. <br />
<br />
after you feel that you have calmed, take a few more breaths and let yourself drift into concienceness. as you open your eyes, you may be able to see your aura, if this is your first time, it could be any colour, but it ussually turnsout blue or green for me.<br />
<br />
after you do this, you will end up feeling extremely invigorated. It&#039;s a long process, but it&#039;s worth it in the end. Let me know how it goes ^_^. now I try to only use psychic vampirism for on thee fly use instead of to fill mself up. Instead of absorbing it, I only drain if I&#039;m going to use it right away. <br />
<br />
I use the above method during the daytime when I can, it works extremely well, although it takes a longer time than other methods.<br />
<br />
You will notice that after a few times of using this method that you start to naturally produce energy, at greater levels. It&#039;s complicated, but it has to do with what I call &quot;aura-healing&quot;<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Now, as For you Lain, exercising tends to release adrenaline, wich, for psionics, as well as other, physical things, is the equivilent of nitro. It greatens the intensity of each action, so it acctually increases the potential of the energy you have. Atleaset, that&#039;s how I tend to think about it.<br />

close your eyes (or leave them open, you can keep reading this if you like), and take a deep breath, with that breath, feel the energy coming out from the floor filling your legs with warmth.

breathing out, feel all stress, and other toxicity leave your body. 

Keep breathing slowely in and out, repeating the previous. Feel the energy coming out of the ground and filling your body up, and at the same time feel any negitivity leaving your body. let the energy fill you, engulf and surround you.

when you feel filled up, take a few more breaths, and drift out of your concious world, and into the world of your mind. (I ussually see a forest clearing when I do this, and myself inside it.) If you find that you have company, try not to mind them, however; if you find them unsettling, you may ask them to leave, politely, if they don&#039;t, try not to let it bother you to much, but if it keeps reccurring, let me know.

Let yourself become oriented for a while, relax, and breath. Just let your body relax, feel the energy within your body cleansing you. 

after you feel that you have calmed, take a few more breaths and let yourself drift into concienceness. as you open your eyes, you may be able to see your aura, if this is your first time, it could be any colour, but it ussually turnsout blue or green for me.

after you do this, you will end up feeling extremely invigorated. It&#039;s a long process, but it&#039;s worth it in the end. Let me know how it goes ^_^. now I try to only use psychic vampirism for on thee fly use instead of to fill mself up. Instead of absorbing it, I only drain if I&#039;m going to use it right away. 

I use the above method during the daytime when I can, it works extremely well, although it takes a longer time than other methods.

You will notice that after a few times of using this method that you start to naturally produce energy, at greater levels. It&#039;s complicated, but it has to do with what I call &quot;aura-healing&quot;

Now, as For you Lain, exercising tends to release adrenaline, wich, for psionics, as well as other, physical things, is the equivilent of nitro. It greatens the intensity of each action, so it acctually increases the potential of the energy you have. Atleaset, that&#039;s how I tend to think about it.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

<br />
how do you do it?, well, through this technique is how I do it. Something simmaler that you could compare to &quot;drifting out of your conciousness&quot; is fading off into a daydream. the whole Idea behind it is to relax your body and allow you to get into that state. It is acctually possible to do walking meditations, and gathering in that method, however; that comes later on.<br />

I&#039;m glad you found this technique a help, this is the technique I started with when I began my studies andI still find it helpful today. I tended to stop needing the technique because I used psychic vampirism more and more for on the fly energy, however; I got back into this technique because it gives you alot of energy and calms you down in the process. <br />

<br />
When you drain energy from other people, and store it within yourself you risk aura damage because of conflicting emotions. My theory behind Psychic Vampirism involves that one uses the same paths that most psions use for telepathy and empathy, so it would be natural to read others emotions and thoughts, the problem we have,however; is slightly more accute. When We Drain energy, we&#039;re taking the energy that we would read the thoughts and emotions from, i.e the aura, and therefore, we are, in effect combining our aura with theirs.<br />
<br />
Now, I looked into storing energy in objects. A common practice in Wiccan Traditions, or so I&#039;m told. I found that people can store energy they accumulate (either in a pendant, a crystal, or something of the like) and then use it for annother time. There was a post on this forum about a red Orb? That would be, albiet extreme, a good example of what I&#039;m talking about. Granted, that one deffinately wasn&#039;t a pure vessel.<br />
<br />
When I looked into it more, I found that when draining energy and using it at the same time, you in effect, avoid aura damage because your body never absorbes that energy into it&#039;s system, i.e. you are using someone elses energy, rather than making it your own. <br />
<br />
The Problem We have to Face here is that when the energy we take combines with our energy, it causes damage to our aura. This is the main drawback of psychic vampirism, therefore, if we can avoid it, we can become stronger.<br />
<br />
So, using all of this information I made this conclusion:<br />
<br />
&quot;When you take energy and put it into an object, you are storing tat energy for later use, it never combines with your system, as long as you only draw energy out of it in order to use it.<br />
<br />
If you avoid making energy you drain part of your energy field, it solves the problem of getting aura damage because of draining, but opens up a whole new problem, you cannot store energy for later use.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if you drain from someone, and allocate that energy to an object outside of oneself, you solve both problems at once. You can store the energy you drain without risking damage to the aura, while at the same time still being able to store the energy you have drained.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
If you look at history, Vampires (&amp; werewolves) always tended to carry some kind of object that they held dear to them, esspecially the older ones. The only reason they were said to &quot;drain blood&quot; from people is because blood was believed to be the life essence within the body. I can speculate that all vampires are and have been psychic vampires because of the previous statement. I have a Feeling, therefore; that I am not the first to discover something like this. In effect, I have just re-discovered what had been lost to time.<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
On another note, I feel that it is deffinately possible that your abilities are being amplified. It makes sense, because your body is used to the intake of energy, and therefore, when you break that tie to energy, your body will crave it. <br />
<br />
If you put a starving man infront of food, and tell him he can eat it, he will feel is a thousand times more than if you did the same to a well fed man. I don&#039;t think I can explain it any better than that.<br />
