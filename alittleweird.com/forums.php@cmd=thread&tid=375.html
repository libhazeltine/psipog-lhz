		<div id="post_8561" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Well, strangely there&#039;s been reports of saints and other religiously/spiritually active people appearing in two locations at once. And they were conscient in both locations, that is, they were able to remember experiences from both places which happened at the same time.<br />
<br />
It must take an immense amount of energy to do this - I mean, basic projection is already a feat, but being conscient in two places at once seems rather impossible. <br />
<br />
Taking this idea a bit further, it would be interesting if it were possible to do this with more than two locations (i.e. six or more duplicates of yourself). <br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure this relates to OBE&#039;s. In OBE&#039;s, it already becomes apparent that the mind is not fixed to the body, bilocation can be seen as possible evidence that there is no such thing as a &quot;lifeline&quot; to your body, or at least that the maximum distance the two can be appart is larger than 20000 kilometers.<br />

The thing that I&#039;m having trouble understanding is that each body is able to do seperate actions, correct? I&#039;d think that that would be impossible, unless you were able to split not only your consciousness but the parts of your brain that move your body, and your nerves, and all that good stuff. If you didn&#039;t, each body would move the same, in separate locations, right? The only way I can imagine that being possible is if you made a construct that looked like your body but wasn&#039;t, like people above mentioned, although that seems like it would take considerable skill and wouldn&#039;t happen much on accident.<br />

Maybe it&#039;s possible to bend space-time using a construct to make oneself teleport to several locations at the same time? Apparently, some people who did this describe this as to &quot;bend the earth&quot; or &quot;fold the earth&quot;. <br />

Phasing is just one example of how space-time can be manipulated to be precisely in alignment with the body&#039;s electrons (even though I don&#039;t recommend doing it). So why not other stuff?<br />

The only problem is how are you balancing the movelent in the third dimention? ussually we make up motion in the third dimention by passing through time, But teleportation uses a different payment o balance off the movement.<br />

energy is required for every thing, so it can&#039;t be a simple as that. If one were to use huge amounts of energy, they could travel through the third dimention in a very short amount of time, however; the momentum achieved would be enormous, and thet&#039;s hazardous to your health. <br />
