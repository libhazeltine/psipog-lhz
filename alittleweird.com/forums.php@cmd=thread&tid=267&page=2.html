gotta say i&#039;m not that i buy this...


i also listen to theta last night, though i didn&#039;t get the chance to try PK after. (actually, i&#039;ve still no experience with PK anyway, should probably start working on that &gt;.&gt;)

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">I-Doser uses SBaGen as its binaural beat engine. SBaGen&#039;s source code has always been licensed by its author (Jim Peters) under the GNU GPLv2. Up until June 2007, I-Doser was distributed in violation of SBaGen&#039;s license. However, an agreement was reached between Jim Peters and I-Doser in June 2007, as below.<br />
<br />
Please note that this agreement does NOT mean that Jim Peters approves of I-Doser&#039;s use of high amplitude binaural beats to attempt to emulate the effects of recreational drugs -- not in any way. The brain is a sensitive instrument, and binaural beats are best used in a sensitive and conscious manner. There are very many positive benefits that can be gained through subtle use of binaural beats, such as those promoted by CenterPointe through their program, or by the Monroe Institute, or by the sequences supplied with SBaGen. Those interested in other possibilities are encouraged to read some of the sites linked to, or read about and experiment with some of the sequences supplied with SBaGen.</div>he also mentions that idoser has failed to comply with his licensing agreement thus far, and that up until last year they had been using his technology illegally.<br />
<br />
the sbagen site has a lot of interesting links to fairly reputable resources as well as some communities that work to design their own BBs. see:  <a href="http://www.healingbeats.com/forum/" target="_blank">http://www.healingbeats.com/forum/</a><br />
<br />
all that being said, i played around with the healthy amount of BBs that are included with the free download of sbagen and i noticed that the monroe institute 10point relaxation session did help relax me, and the alpha, beta, delta and theta tone sequences also seemed to elicit those brain wave states (i.e. being alert, being sleepy, being relaxed).<br />
<br />
i noticed no TK/PK change (no activity on larger objects i have never had activity with before), though i have not practiced T/PK in some time and i didnt use any of the tools ive had success with in the past. it is also of note that i am pretty under the weather at the moment and i didnt spend all that much time listening to the BBs... a few minutes each, roughly.<br />
<br />
Lighting - dim (pc monitor bright)<br />
Noise Level - none<br />
Binaural Beat Volume - began loud, toned down to lowish later on<br />
Other Disturbances - infrequent dog barking, questions from family<br />
PK Effect - as stated above<br />

		<div id="post_7144" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I used to be skeptical about all of these binaural beats to synchronize brainwaves, and then I found BWGen. Although it was only good at putting me to sleep and helping me get rid of small headaches it was a good judge about the BB programs. Yesterday i tried I-Doser and while i didn&#039;t try any of the drugs, I did try quick happy and lucid dreaming doses. The quick happy did really nothing for me so I was unimpressed, but I decided for trying the Lucid Dreaming one. Not only did that dose put me to sleep within 5 minutes after i layed down (after the dose was over), but I had a very vivid dream of which I can remember almost all of it. I normally can remember *some* parts of dreams I have, but I haven&#039;t remembered that much in a long time. Whether or not this was mere coincidence or due to the dose is up to you guys. I am planning on listening to hand of God and possibly some recreational doses and then theta and the lucid dream dose again. I will post any success with the Theta and LD ones.</div>

I&#039;ve been reading up on all this and I have to say that I am intrigued. I downloaded the pack with the doses, and I&#039;m just wondering.... any of you guys experience any side effects with doing this stuff? I mean, it does play around with your brain waves.. I&#039;m just asking.<br />
