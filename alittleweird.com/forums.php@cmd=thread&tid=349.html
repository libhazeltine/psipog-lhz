IF I&#039;m getting the picture of what you&#039;re saying correctly,  it sounds like you&#039;re having trouble releasing energy outwardly from your Dāntián due to a layer of it&#039;s opposite energy surrounding it?<br />
To clarify, did you put that &quot;black sand layer&quot; there purposefully or was it unintentional?<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;d suggest trying to move the energy slowly (as to not overload your other tunnels and chakra if they are immature) to other parts of the body and attempt to release the energy from the new area/s you moved it too.<br />
If your Dāntián has been tripled like you say, I assume you know how to move the energy.<br />
If you don&#039;t..  look at some psionic articles on it, or (and prefer this personally) look up information in qi gong, tai chi, kung fu, etc.<br />
<br />
As for the barrier, if it was unintentional, play around with it a bit and see if you can grasp how to manipulate it, then do whatever you find beneficial.  Whether it be breaking it down, creating gates, using it to your advantage, etc etc, what ever you find good for you.<br />

<br />
but I have to say that the &quot;sand &quot; was just to say that the energy isn&#039;t flowing, but being densed and stuck.<br />
<br />
I had to concentrate on this feeling of &quot;Super status&quot; for writing the post before, since then I feel sleepy and un-motivated for anything. I guess I did managed to flow it a little, but it&#039;s a trouble releasing it, because the best way of releasing it ( which iI can think of ) is by shouting  ( like in Dragon Ball series ).<br />
And that methood I try not to use since I&#039;m a calm person and I don&#039;t have a way to be alone in shouting-range.<br />
<br />
If it helps, I&#039;m almost 18 years old. Do you reccomend I should learn about chakras and other matirials you mentioned before?<br />
<br />
again, thanks for replying :) </div>

And yes, I do recommend looking into chakra and especially qi gong/tai chi, because by the sounds of it, you would like them.  They&#039;re both very slow, calm, and steady arts that focus on fluent movement and breath to control yourself and your energy.<br />
<br />
Instead of shouting, try breathing in through your nose, and then exhaling through your mouth a calm and steady breath of air while you try to expell your energy.  (Have you ever heard the monk&#039;s  &quot;oohhm&quot;   thing?  It&#039;s kind of like that.  Try it with and without vocals if you feel like it.)<br />
<br />
and lastly..<br />
 <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7qHL2PSpecI" target="_blank">http://youtube.com/watch?v=7qHL2PSpecI</a><br />
The beginning of this shows a little qi gong, and the rest of it is pretty interesting..  though some actions might look violent, qi gong is actually a very soft, internal art..   mixing both hard and soft to find balance.<br />

For me,  my grandparents laughed at me and my mother called me a devil worshiper, then called the church bishop.   However, my fiancee embraced it(Accepted and took it further).. and I found out that she had more knowledge in the paranormal than even I did.<br />
Who knew?<br />
It really depends on the person.<br />
And who knows, maybe one of your friends or family is even more advanced than you, but is keeping it quiet; It&#039;s not uncommon.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve brought a lot of skeptical friends into psionics over the past decade..  ..My advise on telling people.. Is to -ease- into it. Just hint at it at first and gradually escalate ( increase ) how much you tell them you know about it.<br />
