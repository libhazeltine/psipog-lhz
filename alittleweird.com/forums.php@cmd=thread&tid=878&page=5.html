Were we to never acknowledge that the sun is what brings us light would the skies dim? No, the sun would shine whether or not we acknowledged it.

It is never wise to get arrogant, to be bold in such a way as to boast in the face of opposition. Arrogance breeds complacency, and from that yields stagnation.

I&#039;m new here and...about the main topic, yes I think Psipog is dead. We can&#039;t let this happen. I came across Psipog a couple of years ago and it was still active. Soon I started my practice but soon I abandoned it too. Last semester I came back to restart my training and to read new stuff. I just couldn&#039;t believe when I found out that Peebrain was leaving Psipog without any kind of &quot;guidance&quot;. It&#039;s like...we can&#039;t trust what people write anymore, we have to be even more skeptical and skepticism is not what I can call a &quot;good thing&quot; here. Besides, our &quot;community&quot; is disappearing! Soon all we believe will become just fairy tale AGAIN. I know I&#039;ll eventually forget about all of this (so will you, unfortunately) that&#039;s why we can&#039;t let Psipog die.<br />

Hi<br />
I&#039;m new here and...about the main topic, yes I think Psipog is dead. We can&#039;t let this happen. I came across Psipog a couple of years ago and it was still active.

I know I&#039;ll eventually forget about all of this (so will you, unfortunately) that&#039;s why we can&#039;t let Psipog die.</div>Yeah, the community&#039;s dying... I wasn&#039;t there when psipog was still active, but still... It&#039;s pretty obvious that people are just giving up on psionics. Psipog&#039;s already pretty much dead, though... It&#039;s just an archive now.<br />

&quot;I moved a paper wheel on a thumbtack using my hands without touching it! Er, wait a minute... was it my hand&#039;s body heat? Ok then, if I really want to see REAL psychokinetic force, I should move that table without touching it too! Er.... it&#039;s not working... what&#039;s going on here?

Ok, ok, THISSSSS ONE...nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you see the problem? Do you see why skeptics laugh themselves silly at all of this? There are only a handful of people that really can do all of these things, and these people tend not to tell others about it. <br />
<br />
Understand this guys, I am NOT a skeptic of psi phenomenon. But when you look at the total lack of scientific interest in the people who go to these communities and are more out for spiritual enlightment than anything else, they are eventually going to sway more in the direction of Bhuddism and Hindu philosphy moreso than psi itself. <br />
<br />
If more people were investigating the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in the human brain, torsion field theory, the science of chakras, etc. etc. then maybe someday there will be a breakthrough that really will cause a complete rethinking in the scientific and skeptical realms. So far, however, it doesn&#039;t look like that&#039;s going to happen anytime soon.</div>

I&#039;m the same opinion as you are. I came across psipog about 1 1/2 years ago..well than it was allready dead like you said.<br />
You really need disziplin to practice these stuff and go on. And yeah it is really hard. But I keep on practicing.<br />
<br />
@kube: I had great experiences with Austin Goh (a REAL master of his own chi) 2 weeks ago. I could really feel his power.<br />
You said its not the same type of energy..can you explain cause for me (now) this energy doesnt make a difference for me. I still use the same chi to move objects.<br />
<br />
On topic: I am also interested in a new community (like psipog) and would totally help out :)</div>

Hello first, some praise, then some suggestion:<br />
<br />
I just want to say thank you to each of the people who have posted here and have stayed positive about the status of psionics, despite this thread&#039;s title and negative implications.  I would like to commend Insectoid and ShadowWolf in particular: You guys have been very strong positive forces from your earliest posts to your most recent posts - Thank you very much guys!  Not only did you troopers stay positive yourselves, but you also encouraged it in others and supported a resolution to put an end to negativity (creating another community).  <br />
<br />
I would also liked to extend praise to the rest of you who supported the creation of another community, rather than letting the negative implications of this thread get the best of you.  Thank you for staying objective rather than falling to negativity.<br />
<br />
For a few, this thread seems to have become a bandwagon for negativity - negativity which the fragile community of psionics does not need.  Although this thread is great for those who feel the need to express their discouragement about our community, that discouragement will spread into the minds of newcomers, who we shouldn&#039;t turn away with pessimism, especially if we want our community to grow and become stronger.  <br />
<br />
If there&#039;s something that should be dying here, it should be this thread and the negativity it spreads (Pun - I don&#039;t mean removing the thread from the forum, it&#039;s a joke at best).  <br />
<br />
Stay positive psion ;)<br />

It&#039;s true that this thread has negative connotations, but it should stay up and alive as a reminder. There are two types of people in this sort of community: those who are willing to help out to make things better and at the same time get better themselves and those who just want to leech off of the community. The latter is partly why most of the new community is restricted of access, so we know who&#039;s with us and who&#039;s not. If we were all going &quot;YAY~ Everything&#039;s going so well!!~&quot; we would probably not finish the project, since it was born and fueled from the negative aspect of this very thread.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you just look at the bright side of the present situation, you&#039;ll never see change. You have to look at the bright side of what is to come if you want to fix the darker side of the present. It&#039;s not pessimistic; it&#039;s realistic and most of all, ambitious. If it were pessimistic, the thread would have died away after a few &quot;Let it be, you can&#039;t do anything now.&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
If you like it better that way: See it as a necessary evil.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_16235">I&#039;m helping out with the community, but I won&#039;t hide the fact that it&#039;s dying. It would be like telling a child with terminal cancer that he&#039;s perfectly fine...
