It started and I was standing at like a little Japanese shrine on a snowy mountain or something. Then I realized I was floating in the air and started to fly around alittle bit. Then something in a small canyon caught my eye so I flew down and ended up in a cave. Every wall of the cave was completely covered in large shards of emerald. I floated to the back of the cave and saw a huge piece of emerald jutting from the ground, it was taller than me and I&#039;m about 5&#039; 6&quot; or something. I touched the emerald with both of my hands and got this weird sensation that I was more aware of my surroundings.<br />
Anyone know what the emerald cave could be?</div>

<br />
So in short, it could represent another level of consciouness is opening up to you, since crystals are the next evolution of a rock, so it could be that. Hopefully that helps get the ideas flowing.<br />
<br />
I experience a little spontaneous meditation myself sometimes too, except I don&#039;t get the images that came with yours. And I do feel more aware of my surroundings, yet detached from them at the same time.</div>

I was sitting in my chair with my arms at my sides and started rotating them in small circles. Got caught up in doing that and became relaxed and started to raise my arms with each circle. When my I raised them almost horizontal I just let my mind create scene for me. It turned out to be the scene I described above.<br />
<br />
So I just did the same thing I did before and had another one.<br />
This time landed in a forest of trees with leaves the color of amber. I walked a ways and touched one of the trees which was soft like cloth for some reason. After that I walked alittle more and come to a small pond with a little walk out dock. so I walked to the end of it and sat down on my knees. I reached out and put my fingers into the water. The water was like a liquid blue gem. Then I dived in and that&#039;s when I came back out of it.</div>

Any idea what the liquid crystal pond was all about?</div>Well I would go back to the thing about the emerald cave, that it may represent a higher level of consciousness, and it reminds me of a book on meditation I was reading, there was a metaphor in which the author described diving to the bottom of the ocean of being.<br />
<br />
So maybe the two are related somehow. But what is definitely happening is that your subconscious is maybe trying to tell you something. Mostly because we receive messages from our subconscious all of the time filled with vaulable insights and such, in the form of images, it is just that we don&#039;t try to consciously look at them so to speak, so we do not know that they are there.</div>

Convenient question ShadowmanX lol.<br />
I was sitting in my chair with my arms at my sides and started rotating them in small circles. Got caught up in doing that and became relaxed and started to raise my arms with each circle. When my I raised them almost horizontal I just let my mind create scene for me. It turned out to be the scene I described above.<br />
<br />
So I just did the same thing I did before and had another one.<br />
This time landed in a forest of trees with leaves the color of amber. I walked a ways and touched one of the trees which was soft like cloth for some reason. After that I walked alittle more and come to a small pond with a little walk out dock. so I walked to the end of it and sat down on my knees. I reached out and put my fingers into the water. The water was like a liquid blue gem. Then I dived in and that&#039;s when I came back out of it.</div>I&#039;ve got to try this.</div>
