Why would theren not be any &quot;new discoveries&quot;? Especially computer science can evolve in both software and hardware fields quite infinitely.  Hardware level speed of execution could come near to its absolute maximum some day, but on the software side, only imagination is the limit.</div>

Its not easy. If there is only 1 mop, and 1 bucket and possibly just a single broom, they need to be very well organized. Otherwise some maids will wait for some others to release their resources for others.<br />

On the other hand, you must do two calculations that both take 1 second to perform. With a single core, you would first calculate the first one and right after you would do the other one.

Naturally it only works if the calculations do not have any dependencies.<br />

I have to agree with Psikillion, that technological progress will not end until society does. Of course, that only means human society other societies may continue to exist, but that is beyond the scope of this thread.<br />
