		<div id="post_12616" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Scientists have been postulating that the universe is holographic. And it is also the basis for a theory that says that your memories are stored holographically, which makes sense considering the fact that nobody has been able to point to a specific area of the brain and say that is where all of your memories are stored at, and given the sheer amount of data each memory can store, and not to mention how many memories you can build up over a lifetime, the brain just does not seem to have the physical capacity to store all of that, unless it was stored holographically. And it also makes the interesting asumption that like cutting out any piece of a hologram you would still get the whole thing no matter what part you cut out or how small. So basically that states that anyone place in reality, say Facelesses index finernail, contains information about every other part of himself along with the rest of the universe. It also makes it much more interesting when combined with some ideas about how seperation between any two people or objects is an illusion, and quantum entanglement, it may go a long way towards explaning Psi phenomenon.<br />

ABout the oneness thing. This seems to be a pretty far spread believe. I also read books with such content. This leads me to the thought, if god exists, then we could say god is just all life seen as one. YOu could say we all are god as well as any animal, any tree, even the earth and other planets.
