Bleach doesnt seem to be as &quot;out there&quot; as dbz or naruto.<br />

Actually, the Idea of Bleach really doesn&#039;t seem that far odd if you think about it ^_^, excluding the episodes where he&#039;s in the soul society... I don&#039;t think the creator is a Psion, but Shinto is a major religion in Japan.<br />

In Naruto, they had a school that trained the Shinobi in Ancient techniques past down and adapted over generations... everyone has different limits, etc. <br />

In Dragon Ball Z, all of the most powerful characters are alien. It&#039;s supposed to be a Sci-Fi Anime in a sense. Ofcourse, everyone has these inherent abilities, but different races have different levels of ability. (The only thing that is unbelievable is the flying.)</div>

		<div id="post_10006" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">My weirdest experience.......simply being as I am today, lol. After all the years of being this way, I&#039;m beginning to suspect it could be a result of shape shifting. What it really is, I have no idea, but after five years, I&#039;ve learned to more or less control it. :)<br />
<br />
Other than that, my experiences haven&#039;t been too weird.....There was one time when I felt something in my room (I was watching a horror movie at the time, so that may have been it, lol) and I asked it to give me evidence that it was really in the same room with me. Well, that night I had plaited my hair in two braids, and not a second after I said that, the band on the left braid snapped and hit me in the face. Needless to say, I was more PO&#039;d than scared. :)<br />
<br />
I understand this may be an elementary question, but about Psi or Chi energy: I recently began exploring it, and whenever I think of raising my energy, I feel waves, tingling, heat, all over my body, very intense. If I close my eyes, they sometimes start to roll around a lot, as if I&#039;m dreaming vividly, so I have to keep my eyes open. My body shakes, and I feel strangely calm but anxious at the same time. I&#039;ve read some other experiences with Psi but such experiences seemed....well, more controlled, or tolerable. I question myself to see if I am perhaps imagining it, creating the sensation, but it seems simply......so strong and real. I attempted to make a psi ball the other day, and as I was directing energy into my hands, they seemed to take on a faint green light, as if I had looked at the sun and looked away again seeing colors. <br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10006">My weirdest experience.......simply being as I am today, lol. After all the years of being this way, I&#039;m beginning to suspect it could be a result of shape shifting. What it really is, I have no idea, but after five years, I&#039;ve learned to more or less control it. :)

Other than that, my experiences haven&#039;t been too weird.....There was one time when I felt something in my room (I was watching a horror movie at the time, so that may have been it, lol) and I asked it to give me evidence that it was really in the same room with me. Well, that night I had plaited my hair in two braids, and not a second after I said that, the band on the left braid snapped and hit me in the face. Needless to say, I was more PO&#039;d than scared. :)

I understand this may be an elementary question, but about Psi or Chi energy: I recently began exploring it, and whenever I think of raising my energy, I feel waves, tingling, heat, all over my body, very intense. If I close my eyes, they sometimes start to roll around a lot, as if I&#039;m dreaming vividly, so I have to keep my eyes open. My body shakes, and I feel strangely calm but anxious at the same time.

		<div id="post_10008" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Well, cinderwild, that&#039;s difficult to explain. I actually can&#039;t really explain it. I can only tell you what happens.<br />
<br />
My face.....well, physically changes. And more or less, I can control it. I&#039;ve taken to calling it the Goddess Effect. It&#039;s actually sort of funny, sometimes. <br />
<br />
So, on one hand, the physical changes make me....well, very pretty, physically. When it first began to happen, when it was at its strongest, I used to have people stare and point at me, people telling me how beautiful I was, wanting to take my picture. (Awkward!) When these changes, I would say, regress, I look more average, I wouldn&#039;t say ugly or anything, lol, but I definately do not strike people the same. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve come to think of it as a sort of metamorphosis, because, as the years have progressed, so has it. I regress less and less every year, it seems. <br />
<br />
I hope I don&#039;t sound crazy, lol. But it has made socializing hard for me, absolutely. People see me one day, and of course they expect that is how I look all of the time. When they see me another day, in what I call the regressive stage, they&#039;re shocked, scared; they don&#039;t what to make of it. So they generally avoid me or call me a witch (sigh). I&#039;ve grown used to it, though, so no hard feelings on that account. <br />
<br />
So, yeah.......My daily life is very bizarre and hard to deal with sometimes. But after five years, I&#039;ve come to accept it. I can&#039;t imagine being any other way anymore. It&#039;s who I am now. No matter what I look like, I am still the same person, every day, &quot;stare-worthy&quot; or not. <br />
<br />
I came here because, as insane as my story sounds, it&#039;s true, at least for me. And for anyone who&#039;s seen me for more than two weeks, it&#039;s true. Unless, of course, they ignore or deny it, which I believe most people do, to cope. I was hoping I could find anyone who might have had the same experience. I&#039;ve always felt alone in this, and I imagine I can&#039;t be the only person to live with such a thing. <br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry if it&#039;s confusing. I&#039;m always confused because of it. :)</div>
