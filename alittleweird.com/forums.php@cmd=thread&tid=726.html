		<div id="post_13562" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi everyone..<br />
<br />
I&#039;m new here, and seeking guidance..<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also posted this on several other similar forums, but had no luck so far... So if you see it somewhere else, I hope you won&#039;t mind my posting it here as well.<br />
<br />
This is my life story as happened until this very day.. I&#039;ve divided it into parts, to make it easier to read, since there seems to be so much here, although I really tried to keep it brief. There&#039;s just so much to tell :)<br />
<br />
So I&#039;m sharing with you my story, in hope that some of you will have some valuable insight, to help me better understand the situation.<br />
<br />
Ok, so here goes! Hope you will like it.<br />
<br />
1. I&#039;ve had great tendencies towards understanding death, and other life mysteries eversince my earliest childhood. I liked to read about UFOs, Arthur C. Clarke, Near Death Experience phenomena, and that sort of things. And I was like, 5 or 6 years old. Possibly younger.<br />
<br />
I remember when we were said at school (first grade) to draw the cover of a book we like the most. While everyone would draw Cinderella, Peter Pan and similar expected childish characters, I tried to draw the cover from one of UFO books I&#039;ve used to read.<br />
<br />
You can imagine the face of my teacher when she saw that :-)<br />
<br />
2. My life was terribly difficult during and after my childhood. My parents had their problems, where my mother betrayed my father, so it caused lots of violence in the family, and I was caught in the middle. Further more cos I was very bright, and needed someone to explain so many things, and someone to work with me. They just never had the patience.<br />
<br />
When they were working, I was left with my grandmother to watch over me. She loved me very very much, but she was always obsessed by me. She never let me go anywhere, or let anyone to be with me. It was like a golden cage.<br />
<br />
Later it caused great troubles for me, cos I my social skills were terrible. Actually, I didn&#039;t really have them. I was always the object of other peoples jokes. So even as a child, I wanted to commit suicide. And I was barely 7 years old.<br />
<br />
3. This led to the fact that I came up with the theory of reincarnation and karma, partially alone by myself, and was kinda shocked when I found out that it is already a common knowledge. And I was still only a child, yet, I was like a teacher to many who had troubles in their lives.. I always seemed to come up to their solutions, and found out many things that helped me understand life even better. Seems like channeling, but not on a conscious level.<br />
<br />
And of course, I&#039;ve always had plenty marvelous synchroicities, and some dreams which appeared to be premonitions.<br />
<br />
Also, I appear to be quite empathic.<br />
<br />
4. Ok, so now the paranormal stuff. I always had this tingling, electrical and shocking sensations coming from my spine, and from various parts of my body, which I found that it&#039;s called Kundalini. Before that I thought it was a problem with my nervous system, after so many stresses I endured throughout this life. I would always have this feeling after I would think about spirituality, or mysteries of life, or simply hear, or think about something very positive. It can be very strong at times, and very frequent.<br />
<br />
5. Next, there are lots of things I see when i look at the sky. I see white sparks flying around (which I&#039;m pretty sure are PRANA), and there are lots of tiny transparent circles. I&#039;ve read that many people say they are just eye floaters, but I&#039;m not 100 percent sure that its just floaters. I found somewhere that such things might be connected to Dzogchen. Here&#039;s a picture.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/ued5hg0zslk7ofxgfxqx.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
6. Also, there&#039;s another thing that I get in the sky, after I stare for a while. It looks like this. (this is a photoshop picture I drew on computer, it is not really visible with normal eyes)<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/sgkaohzpb31l7tq82hml.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
It looks to me like a burning flame, smoke, or an electrical charge, cos it is changing constantly and rapidly. And the more I stare at it, it gets closer and closer, and sometimes it rapidly changes and draws in shapes. And the more I stare at it, more prana, and more eye floaters I see.<br />
<br />
And, if I try watching with each eye separately, it&#039;s still there... So, it can&#039;t be something in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Three people so far have told me they see the exact same thing... but none of them know what it actually is. Maybe you have an idea?<br />
<br />
7. Stranger things started happening recently, when I realized I&#039;m getting visions. First I noticed that I see some sort of tiny lights (like very shiny stars) that quickly flash before me. Also, they seem to be appearing when I&#039;m doing some spiritual study. Sometimes I see them flying around like comets, but all that is for a very short time.<br />
<br />
8. Long before, I noticed that everything around me is like its made of tiny little flashing dots. Like a metalflake finish. Here&#039;s an example:<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/w5h7vpk9lyk8v8rp0ayw.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
And, the more I stare at anything, the more of these dots become intense, and brighter. I found out that this is another part of Dzogchen. I would lay down and simply stare at these dots.. And when I was in a medium lighten room, I would start go get visions of people walking, and sometimes even fighting. However, these visions were never in color. They looked very transparent. Like I&#039;m staring at the ghosts. It wasn&#039;t so easy to see what is really happening.<br />
<br />
9. Now this is new stuff. When I close my eyes, I can see a wonderful crossfading indigo blue light-ball of energy.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/mq0f1nz1l8f2yozz2eqx.gif" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
This one started happening about 6 months ago. Whenever I would stare in darkness, or close my eyes, many times this nice vision would appear. It looks like its IN FRONT of my eyes, and not in my head, so I&#039;m quite sure it&#039;s a genuine &quot;vision&quot; of some sort.<br />
<br />
It also appears to have a goldenish aura around it, but I didn&#039;t put it in the animation cos I&#039;m not entirely sure it&#039;s always there. The entire vision is not always so clear when I see it. Most of the time its a bit blurry.<br />
<br />
Now, what happens when I stare at it a little longer? Well, it appears that it envelopes my entire view, and I&#039;m not 100% sure, but I think I&#039;m getting some sort of images. A few times I&#039;ve seen planets and the universe.<br />
<br />
Also, something similar appeared to me while I was debating spirituality with a friend over phone. Suddenly a blue flame appeared in front of me, and disappeared after 2-3 seconds. It looked like a blue fireball. That time I didn&#039;t have to close my eyes, nor do anything special. It just appeared in front of me. The color was very intensive, and not transparent at all.<br />
<br />
10. It appears that I&#039;m never sick. I seem to have a very strong illness resistance. It&#039;s only this what happened a few days ago that I had a flue. And then for the first time I saw this light in golden color (now its blue again, sometimes with golden aura). And, it seemed that I started having visions almost every time I&#039;d close my eyes. I tried asking some questions, and would get nice metaphoric answers.<br />
<br />
11. Another thing I&#039;ve noticed just recently... When I close my eyes, sometimes huge bursts of light start appearing in front of my eyes. Like somebody would point a very strong constantly flashing light to your face when your eyes are closed. I would open my eyes, and I would still see this flashing around me, especially if the room is dark.<br />
<br />
12. Now this is a weird one, and that&#039;s why I kept it for the end...<br />
<br />
Have you ever been searching for something, checked the same place on and on without finding it, and then suddenly you check again a while later and its THERE?? Happened to me hundreds of times. So I started to believe that there is something involved. This is where things started to become very interesting: I was walking in my town, and suddenly I see a huge building, that wasn&#039;t there yesterday, or ever before!!<br />
I was so shocked, that I felt some sort of a waking up sensation, and I knew that I was gonna wake up or something if I don&#039;t control myself. And yes, I WAS AWAKE. It just felt like awaking. So I calmed down, and everything was fine. Until the next day the building wasn&#039;t there anymore.... Well, ok, I started to accept that I didn&#039;t see it right, and that I made a mistake.<br />
<br />
Some time after that, something big happened again. I know this is funny, but I woken up in a different pajama than the one I went to sleep!! I was freaked out! And then I really realized that something is really happening.<br />
<br />
Watch out for this one. Later I was walking with my girlfriend home. It was late night. And it was Sunday. Once I escorted her home, on my way back I found a giant big hole next to the street, and a bulldozer next it. Sunday! MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! And I walked there 1 hour ago, and it WASN&#039;T THERE!! Then I called my GF, and told her what I see, and of course she didn&#039;t believe me. She said there was no hole when we were walking there. Tomorrow I showed it to her, and she was amazed too. She actually remembered that it wasn&#039;t there!<br />
<br />
Those are a few MAJOR things that happened considering this disappearing and appearing phenomenon. The more I started to believe in it, the more things I notice. I also started to question everything a lot more. Some of them are kinda different to explain and write here like this, but It all comes down to the thing that sometimes I feel like I missed a dimension or something, haha. Things just happen around me without any logical explanations.<br />
<br />
So, thats about it! Thank you so much for taking your time :-)<br />
I hope it was at least a little inspirational, or helpful to any fellow seeker. If so, I&#039;m truly glad I&#039;ve been of service, and would gladly offer more if anyhow possible.<br />
<br />
I also hope some will be able to help me on my quest for understanding...<br />
<br />
Thank you all!<br />
<br />

So I calmed down, and everything was fine. Until the next day the building wasn&#039;t there anymore.... Well, ok, I started to accept that I didn&#039;t see it right, and that I made a mistake.

Some time after that, something big happened again. I know this is funny, but I woken up in a different pajama than the one I went to sleep!! I was freaked out! And then I really realized that something is really happening.

Watch out for this one. Later I was walking with my girlfriend home. It was late night. And it was Sunday. Once I escorted her home, on my way back I found a giant big hole next to the street, and a bulldozer next it. Sunday! MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! And I walked there 1 hour ago, and it WASN&#039;T THERE!! Then I called my GF, and told her what I see, and of course she didn&#039;t believe me. She said there was no hole when we were walking there. Tomorrow I showed it to her, and she was amazed too. She actually remembered that it wasn&#039;t there!

Those are a few MAJOR things that happened considering this disappearing and appearing phenomenon. The more I started to believe in it, the more things I notice. I also started to question everything a lot more. Some of them are kinda different to explain and write here like this, but It all comes down to the thing that sometimes I feel like I missed a dimension or something, haha. Things just happen around me without any logical explanations.

So, thats about it! Thank you so much for taking your time :-)
I hope it was at least a little inspirational, or helpful to any fellow seeker. If so, I&#039;m truly glad I&#039;ve been of service, and would gladly offer more if anyhow possible.

I also hope some will be able to help me on my quest for understanding...

Thank you all!

<br />
Well, I&#039;m simply asking for any possible input... I&#039;m not exactly experienced with this kind of stuff...<br />
<br />
Ok, I&#039;ll try to be more specific. I was explaining some general spiritual new agey thing to somebody over the phone. This was my first time speaking to that person, but she seamed quite interested in such things, and our mutual friend connected us and I started doing best I can. Maybe it is also important to note that I basically made a sacrifice by doing so, cos it was late and I had to wake up quite early. But I still wanted to be of service.<br />
<br />
At the moment of talking, I talked about some of my ideas about synchronistic situations. That was the main topic in that moment.<br />
<br />
It appeared right in front of my eyes, [EDIT: more specifically, perhaps 1 meter distance]  and it seemed like it quickly &quot;burned out&quot; in front of me. Thats why I didn&#039;t use the term &quot;orb&quot;, cos this one seemed more like a fireball of some sort.<br />
<br />
My best thought is that this happened becose I got very much &quot;in tune&quot; with such things. Cos, really, whenever I get more in tune, all those things intensify quite much.</div>

Yep, but I wanted to mention it anyways, simply to present a more complete picture, cos who knows, something might as well be connected to something else :)<br />
<br />
4. Yes, but what I&#039;ve understood so far, this Kundalini energy can be the cause of many such experiences. This again is the reason I mentioned it. I know almost everyone has that happening every now and then, however, everyone I asked says it happens only occasionally,  while in my case it can happen up to 30 times a day. It is also said about kundalini, that in begining it can be very disharmonious, like bursting, and later it starts to feel more flowing and harmonious. And this is exactly how it seems to be happening in my case, throughout the years (though I&#039;m only 22 now, I can still tell the difference).<br />
<br />
5. According to a german guy called Floco Tausin, in his book &quot;Mouches Volantes - Eye Floaters as Shining Structure of Consciousness&quot;, these things do have some sort of higher spiritual meaning, and appear more intensively as the soul is more developed. So, this was just another reason why I mentioned it, as it also may be another peace of the puzzle. Also, according to what I&#039;ve read about Dzgochen (not much), those visions really appear like they are before your eyes. Not in your head, like when we would imagine something.<br />
<br />
7. Hmmm.. Care to elaborate a little more? :)<br />
<br />
8. No no :) This is different. It appears like everything I see is made of some sort of snow. And this is ALSO reported in Dzogchen.<br />
<br />
9. No I never tried, but I also haven&#039;t been able to bring it on for a few days now. I did to some degree, but its very very faint. Maybe I&#039;m low on energy these days, but I&#039;ll keep on trying. On another forum, somebody told me that some psychics reported seeing this, and that this is sort of a gateway. So when that happens, you need to stare and wait for the images. Which is what I did, but haven&#039;t gotten too far. And I lack more information, which is why I mentioned it here as well :)<br />
<br />
12. Haha, yes, this 12 thing is really weird. But I&#039;m glad there are more people waking up to this. I always believed this might be a sort of timeline shift, which we actually do all the time, but not normally notice, as we&#039;re not fully aware or conscious of our environment, and that I just might have broken the threshold, like waking up in a lucid dream or something. I just hope I don&#039;t REALLY wake up as easily, lol.<br />
<br />
And thank you so much for this article! Gosh, you found it in only a few minutes. I never knew how to call this thing, in order to search for it. I&#039;m gonna study it in detail tomorrow.<br />

		<div id="post_13573" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Number 5, 7, and 8 are indeed common. I&#039;ve done some minor research about them in the past and have come up with mixed possibilities. <br />
<br />
Many people say that they are &quot;eye floaters&quot; but I completely disagree with that explanation. The other explanation I have heard is it has to do with the rods and cones in our eyes and the brain. Apparently it is like &quot;noise&quot; in vision and the brain usually filters it out, but the more you concentrate, the more you can see it as you say for number 8. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can related to number 12 is a few times in my life things just seem to pop-up right before my eyes (usually out of the corner of them though.) Since it is out of the corner of my eye, I don&#039;t have full quality perception using peripheral vision so things seemingly do that. <br />
<br />
And the only possible explanation I have for number 12 is that you just aren&#039;t very aware. Being aware has a lot to do with silencing the mind. Take a moment to see if you can actually stop thinking for at least 10 seconds. If you can&#039;t do that, you are probably thinking about things so much that you are actually missing what is right in front of you--you aren&#039;t fully aware. Becoming fully aware for even a few seconds is like being in a completely different world. I&#039;m sure some of you have had that experience. You just sit there with no thought but just are amazed by what is around you, fully perceiving everything with every sense that you have. <br />

Add me to your contact list, and I will email you!</div>
