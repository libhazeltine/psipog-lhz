<br />
 that is quite understandable why you can&#039;t just get here and ask Sean or me or whoever and call for protection because &quot;someone is attacking you&quot; or something like that. Nowadays&#039;s psychics capable of something like that are very rare to cross with (IMO) then it&#039;s too complicated to accomplish such task only with the knowledge in PsiPog and other links from there (like the Psionics Online Network). Just imagine if such calls where allowed! Really many people would ask help, much of it just spam.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t care if they think they&#039;re witches, half-animals, half-plants, amoebas or losers who falls while crossing a corner. They talk about &quot;spiritual&quot;/&quot;psychic&quot; thingie like PsiPog, for example, did. The last paragraph was just for insight.<br />
<br />
<br />
The website seems closed as the Yahoo! group, but you could read the rest of that note (green text) or the home page (link in the bottom, which is not any more useful, but just for curiosity). Seems they were starting psions or spiritualists because they knew that may be hard handle background psi while training the awareness without the defence (like shielding) like my self-experience says.<br />
<br />
The reason I took interest on that was because as you know there should be more techniques an abilities over psionics that are not covered by the most know psionic communities like this one. It really depends on the ways someone practice and thinks of it. This was a interesting finding: &quot;How would they manage to protect people?&quot; Which redirects to: &quot;What was their concept of psychic attack?&quot;.<br />
