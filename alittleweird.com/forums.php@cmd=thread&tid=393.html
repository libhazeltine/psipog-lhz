I remember when I was really young having some dream of being put into some sort of futuristic virtual reality type thing, then after that I would always look for &quot;errors&quot; in the things around me :P like the sky suddenly brightening for a second somewhere where it shouldn&#039;t or something;). No simulation can be perfect.

It has always been a thought of mine, and I think it is quite possible.

Speed of light is the fillrate of the universal GPU.<br />

So the G.O.D Graphics.Output.Device can fill in these very special kinds of Voxels (atoms) fast enough to keep our world from stuttering.<br />

Actually, the multiverse theory makes sense now. We are not a computer. We are not even a program! We are objects within objects internal array: Universe[] multiversum = new Universe[x];<br />

Every Big Bang is a cosmologic &quot;malloc&quot;, or Universe a = new Universe(param);<br />
Black holes are the internal garbage collectors, that remove stuff. That is why even light cannot exit the event horizon. NullPointerException() waits you there =O<br />
