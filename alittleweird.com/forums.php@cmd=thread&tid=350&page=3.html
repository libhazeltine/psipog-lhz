So, I dated this guy, right. I never figured out why I liked him, but we were sort of friends first. By the time we started dating, we had already kissed by the third day. we used to have great philosophical discussions. But after awhile  he stopped talking to me. We barely said a word, but more and more he would pull me away from my friends to go make out. Any way, I dumped the guy and I hated him and I even threatened to kill him in front of all of our friends. I was terrified of him. After talking with you guys, I realized something. He could have been manipulating my emotions. whether it consciously or subconsciously, it could explain why I never really liked him.<br />

It could be emotion manipulating and I think it requiers to be concentrated ( by him ) to keep sending manipulativ energy at you, eventrully he &quot;took a break&quot; of sending energy and that&#039;s when you started to feel it&#039;s wrong.<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that all you really need to possess or manipulate someone is intent. If you intend to manipulate someone, all you need to do is push forth that emotion into the subconcience, like a subliminal message. In order to possess, you simply push out power, and then take over slowly once the person starts using you/the object. I&#039;m sure that RazSh18 has the best concept on this. I think, however, it could have been done through simply putting intent into every word he says. You can acctually get backmasking from any audio, spoken or not, it&#039;s said that when you speak normally, if you were to record it, reverse it, and slow it down, it would show your true intent. This supports the Idea of using intent for manipulation. He could have just used energy and mannipulated your emotions, but all it has to take is words.<br />
<br />
As for more info, I would first look at  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_possession" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_possession</a><br />

If you put these two concepts together, you could get a grasp of what it would take to give such a Crytal the &quot;intent&quot; required to possess a person.<br />

<br />
Sure, it&#039;s possible to influence someone with Psi. It&#039;s fairly simple to continuously attempt to influence someones emotions towards you. However, it sounds like you had a bad highschool relationship. You where friends before; Kissing by the third day isn&#039;t too uncommon... Him becoming a jerk over time, also not uncommon. You being afraid of him shows possible signs of emotional or verbal abuse towards you, maybe even physical abuse. Hey, maybe you&#039;re even &quot;weak&quot; in some ways and where afraid to act. I don&#039;t know how you guys acted together, how your personalities are or where. But going about thinking everyone is trying to psychically get us is silly. <br />
<br />
But psychic? Doubt it. Take into consideration all the factors and don&#039;t leave anything out.</div>

It&#039;s not really how they make it, It&#039;s the fact that it&#039;s an &quot;unsecure&quot; form of communication. You never really know who or what you&#039;re talking with ^_^.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who are you talking to specifically Sheepking?, Myself? It just so Happens that Lain and myself Live in the same town and are good friends, I even know her ex and we are good friends also. I think the reason that him and I get along so well is He knows and understands that I know what he&#039;s up to. I even know who his mentor was...<br />
<br />
It could be anything, but where do you draw the line between the normal and the paranormal? Honestly, I think that we, or atleast I should Drop that word from our dictionary, except to possibly discribe it to other people, simply because, if you think there is Science behind it (as is the cumulitive Psionic Belief), then there is no seperation. It&#039;s as Simple as that, Without Seperation, there is no normal.<br />
<br />
As for what Lain said about her dreams, I can say only this:<br />
Every Dream has a Meaning, Listen for the message.<br />
<br />
The subconcience (sp?)is what controls &amp; directs our dreams. This is a current Convention among scientists, this is not what I believe, but what I understand.<br />
<br />
When we dream, think of it as your subconcience trying to reveal something to you that Your concience mind (you) is hiding from itself. I am very honest with myself, therefore I have little to no dreams in a night. Although when I do have a dream, it is really important for spiritual growth. <br />
<br />
I would say that you should examine these dreams and come to conclusions about yourself. Believe me, if you are honest to yourself, you&#039;ll tend to be more honest with those around you. Intent if used for the wrong reasons, can manipulate others and bend them to your will, however; If you used to improve yourself, You will find a new path in spritual growth and progression.</div>
