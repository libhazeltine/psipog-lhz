		<div id="post_16071" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">OK, this is going to sound a bit odd. But, have you come across people who are ...let&#039;s say &quot;more variable&quot; than others in terms of their looks? <br />
<br />
Occasionally, I try pinging when I am at the store, or wherever, to see what crops up. Sometimes I notice people who are &#039;different&#039; somehow. When I find these people, of course, I do not stare directly at them, but I do pay attention to them with my eyes slightly out of focus, so that I can see them without acting like a complete weirdo. <br />
<br />
During these observations, of those who seem unusual somehow, I have found that some are more &quot;fluid&quot; than others. For example, I can think &quot;that guy has really long, thin fingers&quot; and the result will be that the fingers appear longer/thinner. The change is often noticeable, but not extreme. The result is still within the realm of normal. Not before long, the guy will rub his hands or put them in his pockets and start looking around. <br />
<br />
I tried this once with a classmate. I thought &quot;That is some really blue eyeshadow. I have never seen such a color on a human before. That is downright hideous.&quot; Everytime I looked at her, the color would become more intense. I was not looking at her, just a few side glances around the room. She immediately took up a makeup mirror and started looking nervous. These are just two examples of it, but I suppose you get my drift.<br />
<br />
It could be that our perceptions are not that accurate and the minor adjustments are internal. It is curious, though, that the people I observe should respond the way they do. Perhaps my body language is too noticeable? But, I don&#039;t think so. Also, it only happens with a few people, the ones who have that odd noticeability about them. I have tried this on people that do not stand out, and then nothing happens at all. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer: If you feel a bit unstable, please do not try this! Chill out and wait until you feel like your feet are solidly planted.</div>

<br />
When I &quot;reach&quot; out, I do so in different ways. If I just need to get my husband&#039;s attention at the store, or wherever, it is a direct line from me to him. If I am searching for unknowns, whose &quot;ident&quot; is unfamiliar, to not attract unwanted attention, I use another method. It is a bit like a radar (line) that strobes around the surroundings or its like a burst (more diffuse) so that it is not that obvious that I am the one doing it. <br />
<br />
If I do find someone who is capable, and I am not interested in communication, I use the inner voice chatter as a form of shield. I think about what to make for dinner, just stupid everyday stuff. Thinking about a song works well too. The trick is to keep the surface mind occupied and use the other part of your mind for observation, like two threads running at the same time. You can get more sophisticated than that and keep layers of thought going simultaneously. Be careful.<br />

Well, at first, everything what comes to ones supernatural powers are related a) lives prior to this one or b) spiritual evolution and development of him/her.</div>First, a) not necessarily, and b) not really. I don&#039;t buy into the christian work ethic, fair world hypothesis. Some people just &quot;get it&quot;, and it&#039;s easy. It is more a process of accepting a separate set of perceptions as valid and functional. I would go so far as to say that everyone can activate them, and sometimes it is not even a choice. <br />
<br />
I think Robert Bruce&#039;s concept of parallel memory streams comes close to explain the phenomenon of telepathy and clairvoyance. We strive to be consistent to a flaw and ignore the perceptions that seem weaker, less reliable in favor of our regular senses. The part that controls the flow of perceptions are mostly subconscious, but can be influenced. The trick is to be able to observe and accept simultaneous perceptions at the same time and to get used to using these &#039;other&#039; senses. <br />

Well, at first, everything what comes to ones supernatural powers are related a) lives prior to this one or b) spiritual evolution and development of him/her.[/quote]

First, a) not necessarily, and b) not really. I don&#039;t buy into the christian work ethic, fair world hypothesis. Some people just &quot;get it&quot;, and it&#039;s easy. It is more a process of accepting a separate set of perceptions as valid and functional. I would go so far as to say that everyone can activate them, and sometimes it is not even a choice. 

I think Robert Bruce&#039;s concept of parallel memory streams comes close to explain the phenomenon of telepathy and clairvoyance. We strive to be consistent to a flaw and ignore the perceptions that seem weaker, less reliable in favor of our regular senses. The part that controls the flow of perceptions are mostly subconscious, but can be influenced. The trick is to be able to observe and accept simultaneous perceptions at the same time and to get used to using these &#039;other&#039; senses. 

The other point is that most people expect to &quot;see, hear, feel&quot; something just as you would with your normal senses. Sometimes this does happen, that an impression is so increadibly strong that the esp flood into your normal perceptions and you actually see an apparition, for example.

		<div id="post_16094" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">@felicks: It is possible that we all do this to some extent. <br />
<br />
Some days I feel self-confident and it shows, I look like a million bucks; other days I feel like I crawled out from under a rock, and people react accordingly (eeek!).<br />
<br />
I wonder just how much of that perception of ourselves and of others are influenced by thoughts. There are tons of studies about memory, recall, and eyewitness reports that outline just how messed up and unreliable perceptions really are. But, I have not seen anything yet (academic anyway) about immediate adjustment in which a person would seem to actually be changing his/her appearance. <br />
<br />
It would seem easier to manipulate someone&#039;s appearance (even if it is just my perceptions of their appearance) than to manipulate a static object (or my perceptions of an object). I have not really studied this in detail, mostly because it makes me nervous (if I take it too far, would my mind be able to cope?). <br />
<br />
I wonder, though, if I can change my perceptions of certain individuals, to some extent, what are the limits? Could I imagine that this person levitates, and then see the person float up into the air? Would the person experience a feeling of floating and get dizzy? Or, actually perceive him/herself levitate? Would other people see the person levitate? Btw, are there any psi articles on this topic?<br />
<br />
I just started reading some books by, and edited by, Charles T. Tart: States of Consciousness, and Altered States of Consciousness, perhaps I can find something mentioned about this there. (Dr. Tart and his peers did a lot of experimentation with drugs. - I don&#039;t do drugs, btw. I don&#039;t even smoke cigarettes. An occasional glass of wine, continually over-caffinated, but no drugs.) I have also been reading a lot of Castaneda lately, and in his books, shape shifting is mentioned quite often. I don&#039;t know what to make of Castaneda though. <br />

@Jermo: <br />
<br />
I think that a time limit, or the notion that it is necessary to have to do something x times, or x years, is a typical mental hangup that a lot of people have. I used to think the same way. It is a common trick in hypnosis and self-hypnosis and has something to do with subconscious agreement of personal change. <br />
<br />
A time limit, in terms of psi/spiritual development, is probably not necessary. The whole concept is an artificial construct, you set a duration for yourself that you figure would be normal until you can do something that is, well, not so normal. [I&#039;m not trying to be snotty here, but to relay information].<br />
<br />
I changed my mind about the &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; concept when, out of desperation, I had to try something different: I knew that I would know a topic in the future that would solve a problem I had in the present. I formulated questions in my head, and received answers - from myself. What I came to realize, afterwards, was that the part of me that &quot;knows&quot; is not limited by time to the same extent as the me-here-writing might be. <br />
<br />
True, this is not easy topic to discuss. I really have to fight with myself everytime I post here. Then, I have to make sure I don&#039;t go back and delete everything I have written. I keep thinking whatever piece of the puzzle I have seen might be useful to someone else and that I might learn something new, so, I return. Not all loud-mouths are fakers (I hope). <br />
<br />
Besides, I&#039;m a newbie in psionics. I have not made any wild claims, have I? The stuff I have written so far is relatively mild. Right?<br />

I am certain that there are a lot of people here who would like to share their experiences. I think in the case of telepathy, though, the reason why most people don&#039;t share (and, I&#039;m only guessing) is because telepathy often involves another person. It is one thing to share personal experience, and another to share an experience that you had with someone else.<br />
<br />
So, back to the original questions: <br />
<br />
- Has anyone here perceived this &quot;variability&quot;? <br />
- Has anyone here found that some people are more able than others to receive and send information? If so, have you found anything to be &quot;different&quot; about these people?<br />
- During pinging (searching) do you protect your anonymity?<br />
- If someone does react, what do you do then? Any advice? <br />
<br />
Why should anyone care about this? Because IF this can be done, perhaps regular shielding has a flaw, and it might make it easier to detect telepaths this way. I thought it would be relevant to bring it up. <br />

[quote]Most of ppl here just claim to have experiences and when you ask from them about their experiences they suddenly don&#039;t have any. [/quote]

If you are curious, ask away. I am certain that there are a lot of people here who would like to share their experiences. I think in the case of telepathy, though, the reason why most people don&#039;t share (and, I&#039;m only guessing) is because telepathy often involves another person. It is one thing to share personal experience, and another to share an experience that you had with someone else.

So, back to the original questions: 

- Has anyone here perceived this &quot;variability&quot;? 
- Has anyone here found that some people are more able than others to receive and send information? If so, have you found anything to be &quot;different&quot; about these people?
- During pinging (searching) do you protect your anonymity?
- If someone does react, what do you do then? Any advice? 

Why should anyone care about this? Because IF this can be done, perhaps regular shielding has a flaw, and it might make it easier to detect telepaths this way. I thought it would be relevant to bring it up.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

@Jarmo: what I meant by B.S. was that it sounded as if someone tried to impose limitations on what you can or cannot do. Was that comment about experiences directed at me? The non-practice does not seem to affect me. What does 5-7 usage refer to? Just curious.</div>5-7% means the capability to use human beings brains, it&#039;s the usual rate of usage.<br />
<br />
Well, okay. The physical body which &quot;I&quot; (meaning soul) has, has it&#039;s limitations and it needs it time to heal and reconstruct after a damage or practical session. That what is behind physical body actually doesn&#039;t have any limitations, and this might be the thing you&#039;ve found out.<br />
<br />
What comes to ego, I suggest personally some spiritual (real spiritual I mean) path, like classical yoga (not that BS they teach in every corner, but something that has been studied for thousands of years). Those schools are not easy to find, but if one is ready for such a information then he will be guided to perfect place :)<br />

<br />
The % use of total brain capacity is supposedly a myth, but it is one of those concepts that just seem right. I definitely do not pay attention or think as clearly as I wish I would, and think I could. <br />
<br />
Just because there is no scientific evidence for how much of an individual&#039;s intellectual potential is being exercised/used at any given moment that does not mean that such a measurement might become available one day. <br />
<br />
Perhaps, some day I will have a personal implant that kept track of productive thought, emotions of successful outcomes, and was able to stimulate the brain in just the right way to produce suffucient motivation to continue being productive (good human, pat, pat).<br />
<br />
@Jarmo: When I mentioned the rate of thinking I was referring to the speed of thought. One explanation (there are several) I have received as to how telepaths establish connections with one another is that they mutually adjust the rate of thought until they match. <br />
<br />
For example, if you have three cups of coffee and are discussing an interesting topic you are likely to think differently, and in a different rate, than if you were standing in line at the local grocery store after a long day at work.</div>
