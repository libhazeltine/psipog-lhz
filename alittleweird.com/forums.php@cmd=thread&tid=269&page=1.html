		<div id="post_7046" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;"> I wasn&#039;t around much for Psipog (and felt it was a bit redundant) and am unsure whether or not this would qualify as religious, but I think it is.<br />
<br />
 This is one of the things that we as humans have questioned for a very long time. Free will has multiple connotations and is in general very ambiguous.<br />
<br />
For me, free will is the literal, I would go so far as to call it supernatural, ability to rationalize actions and thoughts as a living being. You may think it&#039;s simply, &quot; Yes! We are human (after all)!&quot; but when you bring in scientific applications, it really does  muddle things up.<br />
<br />
 Forgive me if I sound too harsh, but science is the &#039;free will&#039; killer as it is now. I have nothing against science, but feel that when you look at yourselves clearly through no filter other than the scientific one, we -are- machines. We have no souls, and we have no free will.<br />
<br />
The problem with wanting to believe otherwise is that science covers everything, and it works. Science can tell you that OBEs are just hallucinations of the mind and give <br />
&#039;evidence&#039; to support that (I put evidence in parenthesis as the results are taken out of context and really make a lot of assumptions. It&#039;s similar to saying that life on other planets is impossible by observing just one other planet).<br />
<br />
I have tried, very scrutinizingly, to look at my personal beliefs from a scientific perspective, and it&#039;s definitely a daunting task. I found myself very disturbed by how readily things were the way they were without any spiritual reasoning needed, and even more so that everyone around me seemed to just accept it! Try talking to someone about how odd sexual attraction seems. You probably won&#039;t get far. Besides all that, the big problem is: IT ALL WORKS!<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, obviously we have some sort of wiggle room. You could say my objection to what I consider lifeless is a testament to that. I&#039;ve come to look at life from the perspective that both can coexist. To me, OBEs can be both hallucinations and real psychic phenomenon, for example.<br />

Iunno.. I have to comment on your statement on precognition.<br />
I&#039;m not trying to disagree with you, but I myself have precognition a few times a week, usually &quot;predicting&quot; whats going to happen in the next five minute to a couple hours.  These come as almost subconcious images(like a very quick trance into a day dream-- probably lasts a second) of short blocks of small key events and the stone-cold &#039;knowing&#039; that it&#039;s going to happen. These range everything from who&#039;s going to say what next to what type of attacks my sparring partner is going to throw in my Kung Fu class; and vary from a &quot;strong feeling&quot; to a &quot;crystal clear&quot; knowing what it is.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve experimented with these predictions by going along with them, going completely against them, and just altering the actions slightly.  With every case where I make a drastic of enough change, the ending outcome and a few key events prior, change as well.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion, there is free will in it; precognition and &quot;fate&quot; do not lock you into a destiny; and precognition simply shows you the very most likely thing to happen next if the situation is not altered by someone(The restrictions on that someone may vary-- I&#039;m still thinking on that, but it seems that people who the prediction is about don&#039;t seem to ever change it.  To be able to, you may have to have some open sense to knowing what it is. But don&#039;t believe that. It&#039;s restricting. And it&#039;s only theory.)<br />

I believe free will is as real as it can be. We are, of course, limited by many things. Laws of physics, society, religion (if you are religious), other people&#039;s own free wills and so on. But I believe our own free will is absolute to its own extent.<br />
<br />
I read a filosophy book some years ago that talked about this, the book was &quot;Etica para Amador&quot; from Fernando Zavater. It made an analogy with Troy&#039;s Hector and a thermite warrior (thermite warriors go attack invasors while the workers rebuild the hive, their deads are almost certain). It said Hector (who died protecting Troy from Aquiles) did a very worthy, honorable and brave deed, while the thermite warrior bug just did what it was programmed to do. This is because the bug is actually &quot;biologically programmed&quot; to do it&#039;s job (as far as we know) and humans aren&#039;t. Hector could have just as easily escaped, he could have chosen not to fight and live instead, so his actions were brave and honorable while the thermite&#039;s were just instinct and biologically predetermined.<br />
<br />
Another thing filosophers use to prove free will, which i find very interesting, is trials penalties and sentences. What they say is: if we humans didn&#039;t have free will, people couldn&#039;t be judged and sentenced because their actions were predetermined and no one can fight fate. Their argument is: They weren&#039;t forrced to commit a crime, they could&#039;ve chosen not to commit it, therefore they are punished for making the wrong decition.<br />
<br />
Of course you could always say: &quot;Well, if they are indeed predetermined to commit a crime, couldn&#039;t the cops and judges be predetermined to arrest them and judge them?&quot;.<br />
Of course you could! but I think this is a tricky way of thinking. Not long ago there was a post about this, pseudo-science or dangerous thoughts they called it, i think. Pseudo-science are tricky ways of thinking that are infalible in a way they can&#039;t be proved wrong. As Sean said, many religions use this ways of thinking by saying “If you observe Christianity to be untrue, then really you’re just being fooled by the Devil, and you must believe even more in Christianity in order to overcome the Devil.”<br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s the same with this. Someone might say: &quot;If you believe in free will, it&#039;s just because you are predetermined to believe in free will, so you are really just a puppet either way!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, another thing that makes me think free will is real is the struggle you sometimes make when making a decision or trying to do something. Now that I have explained why &quot;because you it&#039;s your fate to struggle man!&quot; would be a lame answer to this, I can explain what I think about this very briefly.<br />
I think if you were predetermined to do something it wouldn&#039;t be so hard to do some things. Asking someone out, for example, I think everyone has struggled with this one. It&#039;s really scary (for me at least =p) and I have to struggle with it, and really hard too! Until finally one part of me or the other wins.</div>

I believe free will is as real as it can be. We are, of course, limited by many things. Laws of physics, society, religion (if you are religious), other people&#039;s own free wills and so on. But I believe our own free will is absolute to its own extent.

I read a filosophy book some years ago that talked about this, the book was &quot;Etica para Amador&quot; from Fernando Zavater. It made an analogy with Troy&#039;s Hector and a thermite warrior (thermite warriors go attack invasors while the workers rebuild the hive, their deads are almost certain). It said Hector (who died protecting Troy from Aquiles) did a very worthy, honorable and brave deed, while the thermite warrior bug just did what it was programmed to do. This is because the bug is actually &quot;biologically programmed&quot; to do it&#039;s job (as far as we know) and humans aren&#039;t. Hector could have just as easily escaped, he could have chosen not to fight and live instead, so his actions were brave and honorable while the thermite&#039;s were just instinct and biologically predetermined.

Another thing filosophers use to prove free will, which i find very interesting, is trials penalties and sentences. What they say is: if we humans didn&#039;t have free will, people couldn&#039;t be judged and sentenced because their actions were predetermined and no one can fight fate. Their argument is: They weren&#039;t forrced to commit a crime, they could&#039;ve chosen not to commit it, therefore they are punished for making the wrong decition.

I&#039;ve heard a lot of &quot;But if God is real, and He knows everything that&#039;s going to happen, then there&#039;s no way we have free will!&quot;. If God is real, and he is indeed omniscient and almighty and all that, then I think there would still be free will. As I don&#039;t think we are moved by any mysterious forces I think we could then compare God to a really good chess player (or a super computer). <br />
<br />
Chess players can&#039;t see the future. Chess players just see the boarrd in front of them and they know how the pieces affect the game, then they can make their predictions based on that. No one forces the other player to make a move, but sometimes the best move is so obvious that you can guess with geat accurancy what it will be. I think it would be the same with life. If God was omniscient then he would know every possible variable, he would also know you perfectly and could accurately predict your actions, so you still have free will.</div>
