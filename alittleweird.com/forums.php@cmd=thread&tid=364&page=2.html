I still think that there must be some difference in what we are referring to as psychic reception. I simply cannot imagine how something like clairaudience or psychic intuition could be hindered by distance. Think about it. Imagine you have someone dear to you taking a plane to a foreign country. He or she is miles away from you, yet you feel a deep dread in your &quot;gut&quot; that the plane is going to crash and it turns out to be true.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the kind of psychic reception I am referring to. It can provide one with all kinds of different information: From impending doom to what one should do to a promotion, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
I will be sure to look at those links when I have the time. <br />

In any forum I partake in, I rarely let emotion get between myself and others. I like to keep it professional and objective.<br />

I honestly don&#039;t know if you are right or not. I don&#039;t know if I wanted acceptance, but I do know that I didn&#039;t want emotion and conflict to be brought into this discussion. The fact that you misinterpreted my first few posts in such a negative way was quite a shocker for me. I don&#039;t really know what to say anymore. I guess it&#039;s all over now...or...at least I hope so.</div>

<br />
There is typically no difference between what you gather information wise vs. how it is gathered. Ie. You get &quot;empathy&quot; information the same way you get &quot;Psychic reception&quot; information. It&#039;s all just a subset of the interaction of two or more minds, or perhaps some universal medium. At least, that is my opinion on the matter. I do not intend to sound as if I am TELLING YOU how you work. But it&#039;s the interpretation I see as most fitting.<br />
<br />
About photographs and psychic perception: <br />
<br />
I have been shown photographs of people and asked to get the intent of the person in that photograph, their general demeanor, and the pattern of thoughts that are in their head. The photographs have been given to me by people who know the people, and in situations where a photo would show the good side of someone. At a party having fun, at a restraunt enjoying each others company. Looks ARE deceiving. To say that you can gain much USEFUL information about how someone functions from a single picture you see  is quite ridiculous. Often photographed subjects HIDE who they are when the cameras come around anyway. People try and put up a front for them.<br />
<br />
On the use of photos to determine someone&#039;s character: Why not use a picture? Why not use all the resources in your hands to aid your psychic sense? One of the most useful parts of a psychic ability is allowing it to aid in your other skills. If you are a good body language reader, or a good face reader, or perhaps a psychoanalyst with a major in why people chose certain clothes/colors to wear... Why not do both? If you are skilled at either you will understand conflict in what you receive psychically and what you perceive, and that will help you point to a more truthful answer .<br />
<br />
Purism is self deceit.<br />
<br />
In a long drawn out answer: Yes, you can determine someones character through psychic means without ever meeting them. However; It has it&#039;s limits. It depends on what face you are looking at when you check. I&#039;m sure none of us feel the same as we did a few years ago, or maybe months. Some people can be hateful and depressed one month, and cheerful and helpful the next.</div>

Dash, if you are going to be that gracious and humble in your apology, then the least I can do is apologize for my last two posts. The part about irony along with my most recent post were both uncalled for. <br />

When I said that the irony was very obvious, I had meant so in an objective way and I was not thinking about your personal feelings at the time. For that I am sorry. I don&#039;t even know why the hell I thought that I should have taken offense to somefatguy&#039;s comment. That was definitely strange of me (which is why I deleted it XD). Maybe I thought I was responsible since I made the thread. Still, it was an irrational notion on my part.<br />
<br />
My most recent post was also uncalled for because I had misinterpreted your post (that came right before it). I thought that when you said &quot;... actually.. i was kinda right..&quot; that you were going to start another argument and that you never truly forgave me. I took it the wrong way and made the slightly passive agressive post that followed yours and, to make matters worse, I reminded you of your previous misinterpretations. For that, too, I am sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, thank you for helping to get us back on topic by acknowledging SheepKing. I had been letting this drift off-topic for too long now.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you don&#039;t deserve to be disliked (even temporarily). I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve won the sympathy and respect of many viewers with your previous post. You&#039;ve definitely won mine. There need not be any &quot;Thank you&quot;&#039;s and &quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot;&#039;s between us anymore. Like you said, it is all over now, so sleep well my friend.<br />
<br />
@SheepKing<br />
<br />
Obviously, we owe you the most thanks for waking us up and getting us all back on topic here. <br />
<br />
Your description about the similarities between empathy and psychic reception look about right to me. I also agree that we may receive such information through a &quot;universal medium&quot;. I believe that I might know what you are referring to. If I am not mistaken, parapsychologists refer to it as &quot;collective consciousness&quot;, right? Anyway, I want to know what you think about these distance limitations. Do believe that there are such limitations? If so, to what (specifically) do they apply?<br />
<br />
Reading over the part about photographs more thoroughly and thinking about my experiences, I&#039;d have to say that I agree with you. When I said that photographs can provide useful information about people, I was looking at it from a very very narrow-minded point of view. I was thinking about how some photographs of people SEEM to be able to show me whether or not that person is introverted or extroverted. As you can see, that is relatively useless in most cases and is far too specific. I was completely overlooking pretty much everything you mentioned that was wrong with my theory. <br />
<br />
Thank you for the insightful post SheepKing.</div>

Distance limitations are a tricky subject. From experience I would say that distance limitations only exist because our natural instinct is to feel as if we have no &quot;power&quot; over something that is far from us.

<br />
When performing telepathy related skills, if I feel like I &quot;overlap&quot; or am &quot;face to face&quot; with someone, the skill is more likely to be successful. Initially when connecting, or trying to get closer to someones mind, I feel like I&#039;m having to &quot;bridge&quot; the psychic distance between us. I do not know if that is only a problem innate in me or not.<br />
<br />
But I have had strong psychic interactions with people around the world thanks to Psipog bring so many people together. I might have to say that the weakness felt over a distance is probably all in our head; And if there is a distance limitation, it&#039;s probably in the same place.<br />

As for your comment on the distance limitation, I can try to explain that.<br />
<br />
When we use the unrifined form of detecting the collective subconcience, you are getting all of the info like a radio. over distance the signal is less and less strong. This is comparible to audio or ripples in a pond. <br />
<br />
Think about it this way, the greatness of the emotion/thought is equivilent to the volume. You can hear someone wispering to you if you are right next to them, however; you wouldn&#039;t be able to hear someone at that same volume a mile away. This is because you are not using the collective subconcience for psychic reception, you are simply recieving. <br />
<br />
If there would be any difference between, I think that telepathy/empathy uses the links of the collective concience and subconcience. Where as Psychic reception uses the outwardly brodcasted brainwaves.<br />

		<div id="post_8369" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">How can I explain this?<br />
<br />
Okay, I&#039;m going to use Radio as an Example, for sake of interpretation.<br />
<br />
Currently thereare two main types of radio in which society commonly uses.<br />
<br />
The First is the Local Radio Stations, which Can Be Heard from Car Radios<br />
<br />
We can use This Example to Explain Psychic Reception.<br />
<br />
The Brainwaves are going to be Represented as the Radio Station (broadcasting the Brainwaves out into open air). The Psion will be Represented as the Car Radio. <br />
<br />
Depending on How Close We Are to the Radio Station Depends on the signal Quality. If we were to take a car and Put it (theoretically) right up next to a broadcasting station, with the radio tuned to the station, and Started to Drive Straight out, we would notice that the signal quality would Degrade over distance.<br />
<br />
The Difference between radio and Light is Just The power put into it. Using this Idea, We can Label the Difference between light and Radio by the Srength of the emotion. Say that the Radio Station Broadcasted light (disregaurding the fact that it&#039;s a &quot;radio&quot; station). The light would be noticed much further than the normal radio signals you would get from the station, correct? <br />
<br />
Above is the genneral idea behind my interpretation of Psychic Reception. keep in mind this is a Thought experiment, but a valid one at that. <br />
<br />
Now, the other exemple, Internet Radio.<br />
<br />
The Internet is a connection between every computer, like a collective concience, but between Computers, rather than humans. Internet Radio Stations use this link between people to Broadcast out their music, which can be recieved by anyone, anywhere, who is connected to the internet. It is notlimited by distance or by time. A more refined version of Standard Radio. This is my Idea of Empathy/Telepathy.<br />
<br />
Now, Say that the Radio Station we talked about in the first example broadcasted everything through both the internet and through the air. The Person Driving in the car would only get so far before the signal degraded and was lost, However; Another Man half way around the world could get the signal crystal clearly through the Internet.<br />
<br />
If you translated this into different terms.<br />
<br />
The Person broadcasting his thoughts/emotions, brodcasts them through both the air around them and through the Collective concience. With Simple Psychic Reception, The clearness of the emotion/thought would degrade the further you went from the source. Whereas anyone, anywhere, as long as connected to the collective subconcience, would be able to detect the emotion/thought clear as a bell.<br />
<br />
As for What I would use Psychic Reception for, and what I&#039;d use telepathy/empathy for...<br />
<br />
I Would use Psychic Reception to Track down the Source of a particular emotion/thought. Whereas I would Use Telepathy/Empathy just to know that the Thought/Emotion of someone is.<br />
<br />
As for the other thing you said SheepKing. Everything Degrades with time, but you must pass through time to travel any distance, or, at the very least, I have not seen anyone move 10 feet without passing through any distance.<br />
<br />
To do that would require Massive speeds, and going to Einstiens Theory of Reletivity, The Faster you go, Time slows Down. Meaning that it is technically possible to go at a speed that, to everyone else, appears to not be moving through time at all, however; to you, time would pass normally, well, sortof. That topic is for another thread, It&#039;s hard to explain the acctual concept of time you would experience. <br />
<br />
Back on Topic, Radio Might not be affectd by distance, but our ability to recieve it may change with distance. Think of when you throw a rock in a pond, and the ripple that preads out over the waters surface. The Further away you are from where the rock went in, the less of the ripple you will experience because it has spread out over the distance. (Do you understand what I&#039;m saying here? It&#039;s kind of confusing to explain.) <br />
<br />
Plus, When a wall or other form of barrier is in the way, the signal degrades even more, because it has to flow through that much more.<br />
<br />
For another example, look at the following:<br />
 <a href="http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn951426973X/html/x1227.htm" target="_blank">http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn951426973X/html/x1227.htm</a><br />
<br />
Another example I culd bring into this is The Law of Conservation of Energy, but I&#039;ll save that for another time.<br />
<br />
I hope I could get my point across, If you need pictures or something, I might be able to accomidate you, but I&#039;m not sure.</div>

Back on Topic, Radio Might not be affectd by distance, but our ability to recieve it may change with distance. Think of when you throw a rock in a pond, and the ripple that preads out over the waters surface. The Further away you are from where the rock went in, the less of the ripple you will experience because it has spread out over the distance. (Do you understand what I&#039;m saying here? It&#039;s kind of confusing to explain.) 

Plus, When a wall or other form of barrier is in the way, the signal degrades even more, because it has to flow through that much more.

For another example, look at the following:
http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn951426973X/html/x1227.htm

Another example I culd bring into this is The Law of Conservation of Energy, but I&#039;ll save that for another time.

I hope I could get my point across, If you need pictures or something, I might be able to accomidate you, but I&#039;m not sure.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

I don&#039;t know what you are referring to with contributing &quot;that&quot; to the collective unconscious? Psi&#039;s ability to travel from A to C without B?

I think that this could be, no, rather that it is related to the Aura. I think that it could be anything. The issue you are trying to press now is what is the proper definition of psi.<br />
<br />
A common Definition of Psi is a universal energy force, permiating anything and everything (not quite as accurate as I would hope to be, but it fits.) To have it be Psi that is flowing out of our skulls into open air, that would mean that, according to our understanding, the Thoughts/Emotions would carry on forever, however; there are too many flaws in the idea that We produce Psi, it would be breaking the definition without more explination. I think that it could very well betraveling over a Psi Medium, But that does not mean that it will carry on forever like Psi. It could Be possible that the Brainwaves carry on like Ripples in the Psi Field, which in this case, we can turn, once again to the ripple in the pond scenario. The further you go from the source, the less information you will get.<br />
<br />
Try not to be Vague SheepKing, It makes you sound Stubborn, esspecially when you argue. If you want to convince me, do some research, post some links.</div>

I&#039;m gonna be honest my man, I don&#039;t really like you. You feel to me as if you want to be  considered some philosophical zen master; and you carry yourself as if you are such. You hardly ever directly tackle an issue that has been posted by directly counter arguing what is being said; You simply create some vague response with some whimsical reply. Not to mention you in one post said that you weren&#039;t talking about psi, and then started to define psi as if that&#039;s what we where talking about all along.<br />
<br />
Did you intentionally capitalize Vague and Stubborn? Because if you didn&#039;t maybe that&#039;s your subconscious hinting that you are such. And if you did... Well, maybe you should get off your high horse :)</div>
