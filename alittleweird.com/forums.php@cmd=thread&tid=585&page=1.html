		<div id="post_11682" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;m just kinda lost here. In this world we are supposed to be helping others out. We are supposed to do things for good. Though however &quot;good&quot; is vaguely defined, it exists as a concept within all of us, sometimes we follow that, sometimes we don&#039;t. People say it feels good to do &quot;good&quot; things for others, instead of just things for yourself, even though what you do for yourself is also good-for yourself. But there is also another concept-equality. To think of everyone as equal we must also consider ourselves like any other people, then being &quot;selfish&quot; works the same way as selfless, but that works only when you become selfless first, ambiguous? <br />
<br />
Now we can enter another realm, where we can forget about others, reality, and ourselves. But through that experience we are able to understand the reactions of this world better.  We can generally obsessed with certain things, it is understandable that we are always trying to achieve a &quot;better&quot; self, better can be defined in various ways. But that isn&#039;t all to a person. I can put it out there that we all have no limits, no matter how much you might disagree with it, I know it is if we want to do it or not, and working towards it wholeheartedly will achieve any goal. But not everyone achieves their goals, is it that they don&#039;t want something more eager than someone else? There is more to it, it is &quot;self control&quot;. That sounds easy, we can all control ourselves, but to what degree? A normal person won&#039;t run a 3 minute mile simply because they are not capable of it, but to a more specific degree, people don&#039;t really think of it at all. There are things inside us that controls us, to every movement we make, every thought on each movement, every word out of our mouth...sometimes it just happen, mechanically. normally we can&#039;t control ourselves totally, as in the way we want ourselves to be like. You don&#039;t &quot;endeavor what you wish to appear.&quot; It is not so easy to do so, maybe it is just me, but there are a lot of personalities of me which I wished I could control but fail to, then ending up disappointed in my decisions. That is the barrier which prevents us from getting to our goals, and at those times, you just have to do it, clear your mind and do whatever you need to do. <br />
<br />
I have talked about good and bad, and how we try to achieve &quot;good&quot;. But &quot;good&quot; isn&#039;t the main thing that influence us, &quot;bad&quot; is. Bad is what we despise about our life, but also something we can be proud of, coming from two objectives. When we have a bad day and was depressed we can say &quot;life sucks&quot;, but in contrast doing something bad can also inflict joy in some people. Like picking on the freshman at your school. But morally bad is something many people are not proud of. It can be feelings such as depression, anger, pain, vengeance, tiredness, and some more, or it can be actions. But one thing people don&#039;t usually look at are thoughts, every &quot;bad&quot; thought is still bad right? So are anything we can possibly do. But &quot;bad&quot; generally is based on your intention of things, no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
The influence of &quot;bad&quot; will result in worse physical* and psychical performances. future can also be effected according to the teachings of all the religions which I heard of. obviously good brings you good things...<br />
<br />
In another view, we are all part of each other, that&#039;s how we can perform telepathy and empathy, that is also described somewhere at psipog that we are all matters related to one another. Not literally, but on a psychological level, we are one. Not just people, but all living creatures. Then that makes eating the flesh of animals sinful, no? (I am not a vegetarian, and probably won&#039;t become one.) Still, on a level it is similar to we eating ourselves, the people around us. Connection is extremely important, because our daily communication requires it. Connection also make us attached, to love and power. But on another point of view, we are supposed to be detached to the desires we have, because to be above them we must throw away the instincts which can bind us to oblivion. <br />
<br />
when moral is related to everything, especially to psionics. We can do a lot of things with psi, but doing what is immoral would also effect us in many ways, and sometimes maybe even good. But should be do what we know is instinctively right or become &quot;lazy&quot; and do whatever is the easiest thing to do(and sometimes it&#039;s the right thing! OMG!!!), or should we search for the thrills and explore things that we don&#039;t understand, and lead our lives to do whatever we feel like?<br />

Mindlessly attacking and stealing from people isn&#039;t selfish, either. So what is selfish? Here is a list of truly selfish actions: <br />
<br />
Going to college.<br />
Helping a friend out.<br />
Refusing to help a thankless idiot.<br />
Eating.<br />
Drinking.<br />
Shitting.<br />
Pissing.<br />

We can agree that these things all benefit the person doing them, so they are selfish. Strangely enough, they also all strengthen society as a whole. Especially the last four, since if no one did them, everyone would die.<br />
<br />
Also, equality is a lie. Some people have far greater abilities than most.<br />

<br />

<br />
If someone breaks my property, should I let them get away with it?<br />
<br />
If someone kills a person I really care about, should I just accept it as a fact of life.<br />
<br />
Bullshit.<br />
<br />
I bust their lip.<br />
I break their shit.<br />
I blow their fucking head off.</div>I strongly agree with that quote.<br />

For example, if I try to stop a bankrobber, and he gets away, he might come to my house and kill me and my entire family, but I&#039;m sure you would say that trying to stop bankrobbers is a good thing.<br />

I can put it out there that we all have no limits, no matter how much you might disagree with it, I know it is if we want to do it or not, and working towards it wholeheartedly will achieve any goal.[/quote]

I agree. 

[quote]But not everyone achieves their goals, is it that they don&#039;t want something more eager than someone else? There is more to it, it is &quot;self control&quot;. That sounds easy, we can all control ourselves, but to what degree? A normal person won&#039;t run a 3 minute mile simply because they are not capable of it[/quote] 
Yes, but if they really want to, they will run every day until they can. 

[quote]There are things inside us that controls us, to every movement we make, every thought on each movement, every word out of our mouth...sometimes it just happen, mechanically.[/quote] these things that control us are simply different aspects of us. 

[quote]normally we can&#039;t control ourselves totally, as in the way we want ourselves to be like.[/quote]

We do control ourselves totally, just not always consciously.
[quote]But morally bad is something many people are not proud of. It can be feelings such as depression, anger, pain, vengeance, tiredness, and some more, or it can be actions.[/quote]

What&#039;s so bad about vengeance. Someone on another board said the following:

[quote]If someone attacks me should I just take it?

If someone breaks my property, should I let them get away with it?

If someone kills a person I really care about, should I just accept it as a fact of life.

Bullshit.

I bust their lip.
I break their shit.
I blow their fucking head off.[/quote]

I strongly agree with that quote.

[quote]The influence of &quot;bad&quot; will result in worse physical* and psychical performances. future can also be effected according to the teachings of all the religions which I heard of. obviously good brings you good things...[/quote]

Not necessarily, consequences do not descend perfectly from the original action. For example, if I try to stop a bankrobber, and he gets away, he might come to my house and kill me and my entire family, but I&#039;m sure you would say that trying to stop bankrobbers is a good thing.

[quote]Not literally, but on a psychological level, we are one. Not just people, but all living creatures. Then that makes eating the flesh of animals sinful, no? (I am not a vegetarian, and probably won&#039;t become one.)[/quote]

I&#039;m going to borrow a quote from a comedian for this one.

[quote=Carlos Mencia] You vegetarians say &quot;I&#039;m better than you because I don&#039;t eat life&quot; then enjoy this tasty rock, because plants are lifeforms.[/quote]

From reading a biology textbook, it seems plants are indeed lifeforms.

[quote]*for physical performance I tested out myself, my heart was hurting so much when I was running in a bad mood. That happened to a runner who I pissed off unintentionally today as well, he was holding on to his heart and runs considerably slower than usually.[/quote]

Well, personally I can run faster when angry or scared, and I know that they make you stronger.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Perhaps the conclusion to be reached is that morality is subjective. By labeling something immoral your less likely to contemplate its effects in a larger picture and go with tradition even in the face of a distasteful moral practice. Maybe Non-morality is better for the good of all if everyone begins to consider results of all the options.<br />
<br />
A number of religiously inclined philosophical ideas involve aiding your fellow man even at the cost to yourself. While it might not be a poor idea to cultivate, there is nothing to make it better than any other idea outside a value placed by men themself. If all the speices in the world got a vote which one would be most likely to be kicked off the planet? I have no qualm with extending natural rights to animals, but my position is simply that humans don&#039;t really have divine/natural rights either. We have social structures sure, but agreeing not to kill your neighbor in exchange for them not killing you doesn&#039;t gaurentee you won&#039;t be murdered. Maybe if you had killed them first you&#039;d have survived but playing the game that way you end up with more dead than was problably necessary.<br />

<br />
&quot;bad&quot; is also viewed based on motives.<br />
<br />
things that we do naturally for survival doesn&#039;t require a motive, thus, to &quot;wingsofchaos&quot;, those things we do are not selfish because we do not just do it for ourselves, you probably never thought of something like &quot;omg, I must do this so I will not die.&quot; <br />
<br />
The word selfish can also be viewed by perspectives, abusing your abilities even though you gain nothing is still selfish, because your motive is to do something for a reason, that reason, no matter what it is, is selfish because it will have some affects and you would realize that affect before you abuse your power. If you do it for no reason, then why would you do it? unintentionally doing something that harms other doesn&#039;t count because you have no motive.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is not a good thing. We should all know that revenge never solves things, unless you kill someone, which is viewed immoral for many people, and then you would have to pay the consequences. By using revenge what do you gain? well, a self satisfaction and  nothing more,the loss of the one you harmed is far greater than what you have gained. If you take the course of revenge, why won&#039;t others? They will just hand back what you give to them, things will not get solved, but rather, get worse.<br />
<br />
I always agreed that plants are life forms as well, but if we look at them, we can tell that life is separated on many different levels, plants would be somewhere at the bottom. Think of it this way, you won&#039;t feel as much guilt killing a random fly compared to killing a random human. It&#039;s the same thing with plants, we can&#039;t honestly not kill anything, we kill all the time, one sip of water and millions of bacterias are killed. Those are things we cannot control. But what we can control is our diet. We won&#039;t die for not eating meat. <br />

		<div id="post_11876" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">There are two different types of good and bad, good for yourself and good for others. I&#039;ll give four examples.<br />
<br />
1. good for self/good for others: You have built up your body by lifting weights, and you feel good about yourself because of it. You and your friend are hiking up in the mountains, and your friend slips and is dangling in the air holding on to a cliff with a 500 foot drop. What do you do? Save the person.<br />
<br />
2. bad for self/good for others: You have a French test tomorrow and your significant other is very sick. You decide to stay with that person to make sure nothing terrible happens. Your significant other starts to throw up blood, so you rush that person to the hospital. You stay with your significant other until that person&#039;s parents come. The next day you go in and flunk your French test due to lack of sleep.<br />
<br />

We won&#039;t die for not eating meat.</div>Of course we won&#039;t, but we are designed to eat some meat because that is our best source of fat and protein. (for protecting internal organs and repairing muscle tissue respectively)</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_11876">There are two different types of good and bad, good for yourself and good for others. I&#039;ll give four examples.

1. good for self/good for others: You have built up your body by lifting weights, and you feel good about yourself because of it. You and your friend are hiking up in the mountains, and your friend slips and is dangling in the air holding on to a cliff with a 500 foot drop. What do you do? Save the person.

2. bad for self/good for others: You have a French test tomorrow and your significant other is very sick. You decide to stay with that person to make sure nothing terrible happens. Your significant other starts to throw up blood, so you rush that person to the hospital. You stay with your significant other until that person&#039;s parents come. The next day you go in and flunk your French test due to lack of sleep.

3. good for self/bad for others: Your boss wants to promote someone in your company to a higher position. You and your buddies really want this position, so you scheme and plot disasters for your buddies. You get promoted, because you made everyone else look worse than you.

4. bad for self/bad for others: You beat up this person who has been getting on your nerves the past two weeks, and the next evening that person&#039;s friends jump you. You then have to hobble home and rest for a few weeks, missing work.

I personally don&#039;t really believe in the idea of psionic assassination, although I don&#039;t know very much about the specifics, it just doesn&#039;t sound very possible to me. With that said, I can bet almost all of the psions I have known have killed something minor, so why not prove psionic assassination in an experiment? Perhaps on a fly? Or a mouse you&#039;re going to feed to your snake? Or on a lobster you&#039;re going to cook for dinner? There are many things one could test on. Infact, it wouldn&#039;t just prove psionic assassination, but psionics in general as well.   </div>

If you believe there is a higher power, do you really expect your subconsciousness to co-operate in the attempt? Sure. Lets go and commit explicit sin &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;. <br />

I&#039;d say that only a nihilist can get full co-operation from his subconsciousness, when he has no morality to bind his actions. Subconscious fear of punishment from God (Or peers, for that matter) can be mighty indeed.<br />

What if you were to do these things in your neighborhood and tell the neighborhood kids about how to kill someone psionically. Then you have a bunch of murderers on the street that cannot be traced unless someone the murderer bragged to goes to the police. Most of the time most of these murders would be construed as natural. Then when these occurrences become more and more frequent you start to have a disaster which could possibly escalate to the entire world.

The only time you should kill anything is if you need to survive (for food and for defending yourself from death).<br />

Alas, with the community struggling to even scientifically prove the most basic of performances, I must admit that we have a long long way ahead of us before practical applications can be done.</div>Yes, I agree. I&#039;ve only dabbled in psionics in the past, and never got anywhere, so I wouldn&#039;t be able to perform the experiment myself. So, if there are any able psions around who want to prove psionics in a controlled experiment, feel free. <br />

take the sith empire as an example.. (i know.. but just go with it)<br />

this builds an unbelievable hierarchy where the strong get stronger the smart get smarter and a LOT of people die.. <br />

The stronger get stronger and the smarter get smarter, but why do they have to improve? To control the population from revolt? They already have that power to kill any rebels off. To expand into outer space? Why have colonies on other planets if you can just control the population of Earth? To kill each other? This is counter productive, because it kills members of the social elite. This leaves with one more responsibility over the entire population.<br />

Plus the Sith cannot really be compared to us that well, because we are theoretically able to see different parts of the world through Remote Viewing, communicate telepathically, and if we are really strong teleport across the world.<br />

Nope, what you cant see, you cant fight. So, don&#039;t show, don&#039;t tell, and nobody knows why your victims fell.<br />

:D</div>Actually all you need is one psion, who is clairvoyant, to investigate how someone died.</div>
