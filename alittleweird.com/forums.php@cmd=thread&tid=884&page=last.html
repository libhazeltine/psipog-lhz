		<div id="post_16021" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Telepathy can be useful for exams. Sometimes you can pick the answers out of the instructor&#039;s head. Although, it depends on the topic. Sometimes the instructor can go on-and-on about the purpose of the question, the educational value of asking such a question, etc. until you reach a point that you regret trying it. <br />
<br />
I was taking an exam once and a friend of mine was in the same class. She and I were connected to someone else during this exam and it was like she and I and this other person were sitting around talking about the questions, discussing what to answer. When I asked her afterwards she had the same impression that we had been working together on the exam with someone else. She and I missed one question, the same question. It was a national exam, and she and I got the highest score. The instructor was suspicious and &quot;knew&quot; we had worked together on it, he just could not figure out how. <br />
<br />
In the same course, a few weeks later, I started out giving a book report, and then totally flubbed it. My english turned bad, I got nervous, and closed up. Then, I heard a rip-roaring laughter from an OBEr friend who was sitting on the window ledge. I connected to him, and my memory of the many conversations that I had had with him, and my english changed from stilted british-english to perfect american accent. It noticeably scared the instructor who probably thought I had been possessed.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t know about other areas of psionics though. The only thing I have really tried is to sweet-talk cars (junkers) and computers (who hasn&#039;t), but have no evidence that it worked. It just did. I have never been able to move objects or affect lights, but I&#039;m certain that there might be a useful area for this, even if it is only to pull the fire alarm during the next exam, in case I am unprepared, the teacher refuses to give up the answers, and none of my friends know the answers :)</div>

		<div id="post_16024" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Huh, me? Uhh.. I would not call it practicing. It&#039;s more like playing, like giving in to a feeling of curiosity. Sometimes it starts with a feeling of being mischievous, sometimes it is out of wanting to help someone out. If I were to guess how long, I would say since six years old. I&#039;m about to turn 33. I&#039;m new to psionics, though, and I have not read anything about this particular topic other than what I found on psipog, and I found those articles only a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Another example: a guy walked into a room where I was drinking with some friends. He said something about this guitar solo he had performed in front of an audience earlier that day and suddenly asked, &quot;guess which song I played&quot; and I told him (translated:) &quot;the girl with the goldbrown eyes&quot;. He turned pale because it is a relatively unusual song, he had not told anyone about it, and knew that I had not been at the performance. He wanted to know how I knew, and spent the rest of the night puzzling over it. I just knew. <br />
<br />
A similar instance that had that same feeling: I was at the pub with a friend and she was bummed out and feeling lonely. We were talking about weirdness in general when the topic of precognition came up. She asked me to tell her her fortune, and I suddenly told her, just for fun, that she would meet a dark stranger that very night. It was meant more as a joke. She looked around perplexed, it was a wednesday night and the place was pretty much empty, it was around 10pm and the likelyhood that anyone else would show up was minimal. Less than ten minutes later a guy with dark hair showed up and started hitting on her. He literally swarmed her. She fell for the guy and went home with him that night. The guy turned out to be a complete ass, and she got angry for not warning her, but then, I was not predicting that she&#039;d meet the love of her life. This was not really some telepathic insight, but it felt similar.<br />
<br />
In both of those cases there was no build-up, just an immediate hunch that starts with &quot;wouldn&#039;t it be fun if...&quot; and goes on from there. Usually the answer just pops right out with no apparent cognition. It only happens occasionally and I suspect more seldom now than when I was younger. I have been relatively isolated for the past decade or so, and the only person that I &quot;think with&quot; consistently is my husband, and since he and I have been together for so long, what I experience is difficult to distinguish from knowing him well. I sometimes have conversations in my head with family members, but same thing applies: I know them too well. <br />
<br />
I have considered to start taking this stuff seriously and begin practicing. I came across a forum called Open Minds Forum (OMF) and they have a tread about telepathic experiements that I plan to try out:  <a href="http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=PSI&amp;action=display&amp;thread=5543" target="_blank">http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=PSI&amp;action=display&amp;thread=5543</a><br />
<br />
I sent an email about the enneack&#039;s musings blog (that&#039;s you, right?) and asked about suggestions for psi experiments, but have not received a reply yet. I also noticed a thread about RVing here. I think it had something to do with GPS coordinates and uploading images. It seemed confusing. I should probably read that thread again. <br />

Hmm.. usefulness. I don&#039;t know if this is related, but I came close to being run over this summer - something I absolutely refused to be a part of - and about the same time this happened, a building appeared out of nowhere. The building seemed to have been there for awhile (cracked foundation, flaky paint). Was I suppose to die that day and somehow changed the outcome? My husband agreed: the building was new. If that building did not exist before, and now it did, what else changed? Because of that event, I suspect that wobbles in reality can be very beneficial to one&#039;s health.<br />

Not just in everyday life, but in general, it doesn&#039;t seem like that big of a thing. Our striving to learn and hone these skills probably has some psychological factor associated with it, and that&#039;s why we do it, anyways.<br />
<br />
But if you think about it, psi could turn out to be a big thing. As you know, we&#039;re just the few people exploring this new area of &quot;science,&quot; and the world at large knows nothing about it. Aside from the fact that psions can do things other people can&#039;t (human nature), we could potentially rattle the entire scientific community, and if we did, then just imagine the kinds of things that would start happening...<br />
<br />
At least that&#039;s what I feel - that this will end up spurring some sort of revolution. As you seem to have discovered yourself, though, some psionic abilities can be obviously useful, like moving things with telekinesis. Others, like empathy and telepathy, can help you relate to other people. It&#039;s all in how you use them.</div>

Huh, me? Uhh.. I would not call it practicing. It&#039;s more like playing, like giving in to a feeling of curiosity. Sometimes it starts with a feeling of being mischievous, sometimes it is out of wanting to help someone out. If I were to guess how long, I would say since six years old. I&#039;m about to turn 33. I&#039;m new to psionics, though, and I have not read anything about this particular topic other than what I found on psipog, and I found those articles only a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Another example: a guy walked into a room where I was drinking with some friends. He said something about this guitar solo he had performed in front of an audience earlier that day and suddenly asked, &quot;guess which song I played&quot; and I told him (translated:) &quot;the girl with the goldbrown eyes&quot;. He turned pale because it is a relatively unusual song, he had not told anyone about it, and knew that I had not been at the performance. He wanted to know how I knew, and spent the rest of the night puzzling over it. I just knew. <br />
<br />
A similar instance that had that same feeling: I was at the pub with a friend and she was bummed out and feeling lonely. We were talking about weirdness in general when the topic of precognition came up. She asked me to tell her her fortune, and I suddenly told her, just for fun, that she would meet a dark stranger that very night. It was meant more as a joke. She looked around perplexed, it was a wednesday night and the place was pretty much empty, it was around 10pm and the likelyhood that anyone else would show up was minimal. Less than ten minutes later a guy with dark hair showed up and started hitting on her. He literally swarmed her. She fell for the guy and went home with him that night. The guy turned out to be a complete ass, and she got angry for not warning her, but then, I was not predicting that she&#039;d meet the love of her life. This was not really some telepathic insight, but it felt similar.<br />
<br />
In both of those cases there was no build-up, just an immediate hunch that starts with &quot;wouldn&#039;t it be fun if...&quot; and goes on from there. Usually the answer just pops right out with no apparent cognition. It only happens occasionally and I suspect more seldom now than when I was younger. I have been relatively isolated for the past decade or so, and the only person that I &quot;think with&quot; consistently is my husband, and since he and I have been together for so long, what I experience is difficult to distinguish from knowing him well. I sometimes have conversations in my head with family members, but same thing applies: I know them too well. <br />
<br />
I have considered to start taking this stuff seriously and begin practicing. I came across a forum called Open Minds Forum (OMF) and they have a tread about telepathic experiements that I plan to try out:  <a href="http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=PSI&amp;action=display&amp;thread=5543" target="_blank">http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=PSI&amp;action=display&amp;thread=5543</a><br />

I sent an email about the enneack&#039;s musings blog (that&#039;s you, right?) and asked about suggestions for psi experiments, but have not received a reply yet. I also noticed a thread about RVing here. I think it had something to do with GPS coordinates and uploading images. It seemed confusing. I should probably read that thread again.</div>I am able to do that every once in a while, such as just coming up with random facts about a person&#039;s life that it would not have been possible to know unless that person told me. Somewhat helpful every once in a while on exams, though.</div>
