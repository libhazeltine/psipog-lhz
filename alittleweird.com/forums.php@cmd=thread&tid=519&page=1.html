That is true, but also light moves much faster then time (as in the gears in the clocks) so it is possible that he is just slowing it down, or if it did compleatly stop time wouldnt the light that is being recived by the rods and cones in your eyes also stay in place meaning you would see the same image?</div>

Interesting to think what would happen if the subject moved his head during this experiment? <br />
<br />
Fore example: You are standing several feet from the lightsource, and the time frozes. You take half-a-step backwards. Now your eyes are in the spot, that was occupied by your head at the time time timely froze. There would be no photons in that space, as it was blocked by your head. <br />

I am assuming here, that the photons already touching your &quot;vision cells&quot; are not moving with you. <br />

You also have to look into the possibility that you are actually just keeping yourself from realizing whats going on for a few seconds, and then catching back up with the world, the mind can put images in your head.

One of the laws of light is that it always moves at the speed of light. Even if you are moving at the speed of light and time stops, light will still move at the speed of light.</div>Using &quot;always&quot; in this context just asks for this link: <br />

Plus in this case, its the time that is stopping around the subject. As time is defined by changes happening in spacetime, there should be no state changes within this field. Photons should stand still.<br />
