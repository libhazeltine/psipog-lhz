What do you mean with cool, the training on people who have no idea part or the making people puke part? ^^<br />
<br />
Best thing I achieved so far, although it was more a bubble than telepathy/empathy, was keeping my boss away from me. I&#039;m working as a software engineer. And my boss in my previous job(also software engineering ;)) would always come to me, sit next to me and watch what I was doing, sometimes for hours (I think you can imagine how annoying that is). Annoyance makes creative ;), so I created a spiky bubble around me every now and then. My boss never came near me ever again ^^ (one of my co-workers even asked me I I did that, because my boss always sat next to him after that ^^)<br />
<br />
Theres also a good documentary about secret KGB experiments:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FkYFxUSAJY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FkYFxUSAJY</a><br />
There&#039;s also a part about a guy who actually broke into Stalins highly guarded house, without being stopped, by causing the gaurds to think he was someone, they were scared of. I think that may be sth like what you look for eggman</div>

		<div id="post_16573" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">XD I meant the part with &quot;..like getting them to stop reading the news paper or opening and closing jackets. ..&quot;<br />
<br />
@ShadowmanX: Cool<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not how to do it that&#039;s important. Once you acquire enough control over your own mind, you can do it in a million ways. &quot;With meditation, there&#039;s nothing that you can&#039;t do,&quot; like a yogi who once visited us had said.<br />
<br />
Psionics is certainly not dying. To me it even seems like it has just been born. There are active communities out there, people who do really amazing stuff. There&#039;s a forum that I have advertised on this one for .. I guess 3 times.<br />
<br />
For inspiration and motivation:<br />
<br />
I once requested my father&#039;s attention, when his mind was stuck in a while(1) loop by taking the feeling of not being answered and forming a construct in his head with this feeling imprinted. His reaction was pretty interesting =D. He quickly turned around and asked: &quot;What???&quot; with a great surprise in his eyes. Well, so far it has only happened once that I have had to force something like that.<br />
<br />
Usually I just visualize what it feels like to be the person I want to connect to. When I get their feeling and feel mine degrading, I can browse stuff related to their feelings. After that, I suddenly understand what they&#039;re saying if it didn&#039;t make any sense before. It probably works both ways, as they usually begin to understand me better as well. Haven&#039;t tried to plant any feelings this way though.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I just wish for someone to appear somewhere and usually they do, with a slight delay of a few seconds or a couple of minutes. Making a construct, imprinting the feeling of &quot;I&#039;m waiting&quot; and sending it to them has also worked the same way for me.</div>

Well, I suppose it&#039;s expected for people to change at different rates. Some people are quite set in their ways.<br />

That&#039;s an interesting point about the Buddha and the rest of them, and something that I&#039;ve considered. I think that anyone could theoretically replicate their results, it would just take intense devotion, which not many people throughout the ages posses.<br />

To be able to keep at it without ever slipping in one&#039;s focus on the intended feelings .. that&#039;s difficult. It really does intense devotion and focus with rapidly increasing strength over time. As manifestation becomes easier, everything becomes more slippery as well.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s interesting that when one loses their focus and becomes vulnerable, people around them change. Reminds me of how people in Inception reacted against intruders (weird looks, some random guy on the street calling names and so on..). I had a sudden drop from being really happy to feeling crappy and it was really strange to see how people&#039;s reactions changed.<br />
