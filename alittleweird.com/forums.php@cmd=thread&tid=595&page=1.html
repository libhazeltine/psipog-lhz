But anyways, it&#039;s an interesting topic. So Searbhbinn, you just introduced yourself basically, why is it that you have come here? Is your said power troublesome or something? Do you just want people to believe you? I for one believe in part of your power, although, I just don&#039;t like how you have a label for your power. It just makes it seem like it was thought up by you, which then, makes it seem more unrealistic.<br />
<br />
After a brief few minutes of research, the term &quot;Reality Warper&quot; is used in many comic books and superhero related stories, as well as in Naruto. <br />
I also researched &quot;Djinn,&quot; which was as Searbhbinn said. </div>

Most people can only spin a paper wheel, but people are always asked to lift up a car or something ridiculous like that for proof. Do you see what I&#039;m saying? It&#039;s a very common occurrence (not necessarily a car obviously).</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

First off, genies are portrayed as REALLY powerful in pop culture, and he didn&#039;t specify anything about the extend of his alleged abilities, so why is it so weird that people would immediately associate him with the genies they know of?</div>

		<div id="post_11843" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I agree with cinderwild here. He claimed to be able to change &quot;logic, time, and events.&quot; Now, I can kinda see your point, SFG, but saying &quot;I can move things with my mind&quot; is a little bit less... precise (I think I&#039;ve got the right word there...). You could easily add in &quot;if they weigh less than 1 pound&quot; at the end of the claim and not have changed your claim in any significant way. But what limiters do you add to being able to &quot;change logic, time, and event?&quot; Also, genies in American pop culture are not the same thing as old style Arabic djinn&#039;s. If memory serves, djinn&#039;s are simply spirits in many texts. So his story is a little inconsistent there. Which one: A simple spirit or an all-powerful being?<br />
<br />
Finding our keyboards&#039; locations would be easy for one who can do what he claims. Just alter events to where he recieved a convenient list of our addresses, and the locations of our keyboards in our houses.</div>

		<div id="post_11844" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Okay, I see what you guys are saying. I just wanted to be a little easier on him was all. I&#039;m also treating his claims in a more realistic way, just like the TK thing, I&#039;m not going to think he can do something extrodinary, I&#039;m thinking he may be able to do something very minor, like most abilities I&#039;ve seen. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s personally how I think out of the ordinary claims should be looked at. I&#039;m not sure if there is a name for it, but it&#039;s like when someone tells you a movie is awesome, you then prepare in your mind to see an awesome movie but it turns out it wasn&#039;t that great because you set your expectations really high. I think the same can go for outrageous claims, if you dim the claim down a bit, it can seem more realistic. But, if you make it god-like per say, it makes you more negative about it and makes the claims even more unrealistic. It&#039;s hard for me to explain, hopefully I got my point across. </div>
