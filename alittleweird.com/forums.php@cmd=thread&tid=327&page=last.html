		<div id="post_7674" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So I fell asleep today while in the chat over the geiger counter; And I guess it was in my mind as I went to bed and I was aware of it in the dream.<br />
<br />
I dreamt about being in this library place where everyone from a little weird would go and hang out and chat :-P It was funny because people would use computers to talk but they where also there in person. It was sort of like... Everyone recognized that each person was someone from the community; but didn&#039;t ask who and only talked about psi stuff when they got on the internet.<br />
<br />
It was just funny because I recognized certain people being certain personalities. I think the funniest character was Sean; It was him spot on; from what he looks like in the videos, but his attitude was just like completely indifferent and almost comically so. I guess I saw Psi_Ninja there too and mad_hatter heheh.<br />
<br />
Dreams are pretty cool; And this is actually one of the only dreams I remember from the week so far; and it was long as hell, though In only slept for an hour or two. Anyone have any cool little dreams lately, related to the community?</div>

		<div id="post_7703" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Mmm, I had a rather interesting dream last night...just a dream, no vision, but it had an odd...feeling about it. Sort of mysterious and mystical...<br />
<br />
It was dusk in the artic, or someplace like it. There was a small little camp on a sort of icy plateau, and behind the camp was a steep, vertical wall of ice, sort of like a glacier I guess. The light was fading fast and the aura was shimmering between various hues in the sky, though the remaining light of day and the light from various fires made it pretty easy to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
There were eight people, I don&#039;t remember their features too well, but they were all adults and were wearing heavy pelts and furs, sort of like what you see Eskimos wear. They were lined up in front of the glacier, parallel to it. A small crowd was watching them. It was dark over by the glacier, but the eight people seemed to give off a faint cyan glow...they weren&#039;t glowing, but the air around them sort of was...it&#039;s hard to explain. Anyways, they all did something, and floated up into the air, stopping maybe eight feet up. Some of them appeared to be straddling the air, but most just floated there as if they were standing on solid ground. There were some cheers and someone declared &quot;...successfully levitated 0.6 meters off the ground&quot;, though they were definitely higher up than 0.6 meters...<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t remember much after that. I think they just floated there for a while, then the scene flashed to some kids playing soccer on the ice, and that&#039;s all I can remember. I don&#039;t know how I know this, but I know that the people in my dream were conducting some sort of psionic experiment and it had gone well...it also seemed they were all trying to connect with something...spiritual or other-worldly (again, I don&#039;t know how I know this).<br />
<br />
Pretty freaky dream. It was quite vivid and I&#039;ve been thinking of it all day... &gt;.&gt;</div>

I never had dreams about PsiPog or ALW, but I&#039;ve already had many about psi stuff.Curiously I had a dream about Spoonbending and PK last night. I&#039;ve never get PK right, but I practise it some days a week and when I practise it specialy hard the next night I dream with it. Yesterday I dreamt that I was in one of Jack Houck&#039;s PK Parties. Miraclously, I meltd a spoon at first try!! I was so happy that I did it over and over again without any trouble! wooow! I wish that dream to come true!<br />
<br />
At about 4 months ago I dreamt about falling of the bed, then when I stand up I lifted my arm away and a pen started to levitate with a strange weak glow!<br />
<br />
What a sleep times I have!</div>

I never had dreams about PsiPog or ALW, but I&#039;ve already had many about psi stuff.Curiously I had a dream about Spoonbending and PK last night. I&#039;ve never get PK right, but I practise it some days a week and when I practise it specialy hard the next night I dream with it. Yesterday I dreamt that I was in one of Jack Houck&#039;s PK Parties. Miraclously, I meltd a spoon at first try!! I was so happy that I did it over and over again without any trouble! wooow! I wish that dream to come true!

At about 4 months ago I dreamt about falling of the bed, then when I stand up I lifted my arm away and a pen started to levitate with a strange weak glow!

What a sleep times I have!</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

My weirdest dreams involve alot of Breathing in water, and a voice playing through my head saying &quot;I am Just a Drop, I am the Whole Ocean.&quot; then Everything around me fades into blue, then black, and I wake up.</div>

It sometimes can happen just for remember things. I think on sleeping as brain&#039;s defragmentation tool. Memories acrossing mind appear as visions.</div>
