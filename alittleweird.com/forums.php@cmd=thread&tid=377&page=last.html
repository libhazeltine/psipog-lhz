psiwheel was a bit of a turning point as far as belief goes. <br />
One must also  constantly be testing for false positives. <br />
For instance, I&#039;ve given up using plastic straws altogether bc they <br />
are very susceptible to static electricity and I was getting some false results.  <br />

Ice is better than the psiwheel in that respect, because <br />
one practically eliminates the wind factor.  Let&#039;s not think <br />
that the laws of physics stop applying just bc we are doing <br />
something a bit unusual.  That is definitively not the case. With <br />
psionics we are able to cause small movements in small objects <br />
subject to low friction.  We can usually act on the way the object<br />
responds to the Earth&#039;s magnetic field (the Northern magnetic <br />
attraction) but rarely are we capable of escaping the main force <br />
which is Gravity.  Legit levitation vids are extremely rare.  <br />

The geiger experiment was proof, wasn&#039;t it?<br />
