<br />
The only popular gamelines are pokemon and zelda, and if it wasnt for pokemon no one wold have bought the DS.<br />
<br />
Plus the whole idea that the Wii was ment to be aimed at the untaped market of gaming, old people and little children?? and they are ment to pay $800(NZ) for a console? the idea boggels the mind. if u pay that much for a console and then around $100 for a game then you dont want so stupid 5min game that u can play on the net for free, you want a game with a real storyline and hours of game play, not to mention that the Wii uses a remote as the controler. even with the motion sensor (which is very buggy) there isnt enough interface for the player and it uncomfortable to use. <br />

Are the consoles really $800 where you live? There only like $250 in America. Although it must be said in Nintendo&#039;s defense that there lastest product has become very popular. It&#039;s been over two years since they came out and there are still hard to get. Also that new game Wii Fit has achieved its goal of making the Wii popular for both young and old. Wii Fit&#039;s almost as hard to come by as the console. You can&#039;t really say that about Microsoft&#039;s and Playstaion&#039;s products now can you? ^_^</div>

People acutally buy Wiis in America?<br />
And honestly its popluar with old and young people?<br />
<br />
Over here the only people they are sold to are the people with too much money (the people who have a New computer, a xbox 360 and a ps3)<br />
<br />
and what do u mean bout saying that bout their product? there are a huge amount of owners of xboxs and playstations, xbox live is huge.<br />
<br />
I hope this doesnt sound harsh im just trying to give a different country&#039;s perspective on it lol.<br />
<br />
and concerning the 800 dollar thing, are money is worth bout 60-70 american cents but since we are so far away everythings expensive due to imports, plus we get payed very little (if i was to do a job in america and got payed 10us dollars, if i did the same job here i would still proberly get 10nz dollars even though our moneys worth less)</div>

I happen to be a Game developer, and a lot of what you said is only half true from where I sit.. but I can see where you&#039;re coming from.<br />
<br />
In most areas, the wii is still outselling the PS3 and the 360 by a ton. When it first came out, I think it was around eight Wii to every PS3 and three to four wii to every 360.   It&#039;s not as high now, but they&#039;re still outselling them.<br />
<br />
The truth about the Wii&#039;s capabilities and the games that are coming out for it is that NO ONE is using the Wii to it&#039;s full potential.  The Wii&#039;s very capable of handling gameplay and gfx ten times heavier than what you&#039;re seeing now.  The problem is Nintendo, and I agree with you on that =/; They&#039;re not making many good games(though there are some)<br />
<br />
If some indy companies would just pick it up and start dev&#039;ing for it, you could have some pretty awesome games.<br />
<br />
<br />
(also, 800 for a wii? wtf man. you&#039;re getting screwed over.)<br />

EDIT: Your money won&#039;t be worth much less by the looks of where the US dollar is going.</div>

i happen to greatly enjoy my wii. fact, i just had it round at my aunts with the rest of my family for my 19th (yea, i know &gt;.&gt;) and we had lots of fun with it. we started off with wii sport then moved on to mario kart, and everyone was getting into it. including a 2 year old (with help), and 4 year old (mostly alone) and grandparents. and it&#039;s having everyone playing at once that makes it so fun. you just can&#039;t get whole families playing like that with a PS/Xbox. groups of people, sure, but not whole families. (lame as it sounds, it is actually much more fun this way)<br />
<br />
certainly, the wiis power is nothing next to the PS3/360, but IMO that actually has very little to do with how good the system is.  as there&#039;s barely any need for anything better than what the wiis running. graphics are already around the limit of what our eyes can process.
