The <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span> text means we&#039;ve approved of it and, for now at least, it&#039;s making its way to the final result. So I&#039;ll divide this into a few categories. When you get an idea, post it in this thread and we can start compiling everything and discussing the ideas we have so far.<br />
<br />
<strong>[Name]</strong><br />
Psi Academy (Proposed by Kube)<br />
New Beginnings (Proposed by mrj)<br />
Psinapse (Proposed by Reniiji)<br />
The Academy (Proposed by Shaffertyler)<br />
<br />
(Ummm... Guys unless everyone wants this, we need other ideas and put it to a vote XD)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Plan]</strong><br />
- 2-tier plan (Proposed by Instectoid)<br />
     1. Open an IRC or other chatroom.<br />
     2. Find dedicated psions willing to help.<br />
     3. Start giving lectures and seminars to form a base community and for everyone to start knowing each other more. Also used to determine who does what in the school.<br />
     4. After we&#039;ve determined a teacher for every main subject, we create a forum.<br />
     5. Start giving the classes. Also open an AP class for those already familiar with psi, kind of like an intensive program.<br />
     6. Once a student graduates, they can become teachers.<br />
<br />
- Library plan (Proposed by Dash)<br />
     1. Start with a library with a bunch of articles on different subjects<br />
     2. Teach in the forums, but formal classes will have to wait if we lack resources.<br />
     3. When we have enough teachers, they can start taking a few students under their wing and teach in more organized classes.<br />
<br />
- Forum-only plan (Proposed by Falcon)<br />
<br />
(This isn&#039;t an A or B thing, I just listed them like this to be more organized, but they do seem similar...)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Progress]</strong><br />
- Students are given grades according to assignments, either individual or in group. (Proposed by Dash)<br />
- Students are graded on their knowledge, not their skill. (Written exams?) (Proposed by Dash) (SEE 4 POSTS DOWN)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Who&#039;s who]</strong><br />
- When a student graduates, they get to apply to become a teacher. They need to be judged not only on their grades but also on their personality, skill as a teacher, etc. (Proposed by Insectoid)<br />
- Ranking system: The classes have different levels of knowledge, so we have beginner, intermediate and advanced students along with teachers. Create a tutoring program so the more experienced students can help out newer ones advance and help out the teachers. (Proposed by Kube)<br />
- Ranking system with special privileges for higher ranks based on credits. (Proposed by Dash) (SEE 4 POSTS DOWN)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Motivation]</strong><br />
- Achievements. Create an achievement board where everybody can compare each others&#039; achievements. Bragging rights, in other words. (Proposed by arzhul)<br />
- A teacher of the month system. (Proposed by mrj)<br />
- Similar to teacher of the month, have a student of the month for every class. That student gets bonus points and/or an achievement. (Proposed by Kube)<br />
- Take note of the students&#039; study in independent fields. (Magic, Qigong, etc.) (Proposed by mrj)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Quality]</strong><br />
- Interview the students before they can be admitted in the school to uphold the quality of the community. (Proposed by Kube)<br />
- If we require an admission to get a school membership, guests and applicants waiting for their admission should have a public section where they can have a sample of the school&#039;s content. (Proposed by mrj)<br />
- Interview teachers to see who&#039;s a hoax and who knows what they&#039;re talking about. (Proposed by arzhul)<br />
- Create a detailed application form to verify the teacher&#039;s skill, knowledge and know more about their ways of thinking/teaching. (Proposed by Kube)<br />
- Get an empath to interview applicants and would-be teachers so they can pick up the other&#039;s feelings. (Proposed by Dash)<br />
<br />
<strong>[Staff]</strong><br />
Dash: Organizer, Teacher (Energy Manipulation, Healing, Sensing)<br />
mrj: Advisor, Organizer, Possible teacher<br />
Kube: Advisor, Organizer<br />
Trick: Teacher (Energy manipulation, PK, Empathy)<br />
f3licks: Teacher (EM, Empathy, PK)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it for now. If I missed anything, write it signal me and I&#039;ll add it in. Also be sure to check if the names are right, I wouldn&#039;t want to give someone false credit :P<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, this isn&#039;t an A or B thing. All those things in the list could very well be merged together, but for the sake of organization, I separated everything.</div>

<br />
Maybe if we get enough teachers, we could have a teacher of the month thing? It&#039;s just an idea though, not a serious suggestion.<br />
<br />
Also: If we have any sort of written assignment type things, we should archive them somewhere, as a guide for beginning students. <br />
<br />
As a motivation tool, it may be a good idea to describe what increased proficiency in psiionics might entail. IE: working your way up through the ranks, getting to teach, interesting skills to learn etc etc. <br />
<br />
I think students should be able to independently study separate fields as well, perhaps being taken note of in their rank. (separate fields being things like magick or qi-gong, or an untaught skill in the school) They could write about things they&#039;ve discovered and it could be taken note of.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll keep thinking of things, take or leave (Or modify) what I&#039;ve posted.<br />

Teacher of the month, sure. It also makes me think about how they did it when I was in high school. The best students would get recognition from the teacher(s) and have special privileges (Maybe just an achievement in our case)<br />
<br />
We should only archive the best assignments, though. Like a teacher who uses the best exam copy in the class to show the other students how the best did it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure what you mean in that 4th paragraph... You mean making a kind of organized list on what skills should you have mastered as you go up in the ranks? Like in martial arts you need to know at least a certain set of techniques and forms before you can get the next sash?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, never mind I think I get it now XD You mean a list or something presenting the benefits of getting better, right?<br />
<br />
By being taken note of, you mean they&#039;d get kind of a bonus point or two for taking the initiative of learning other things independently? That could work. Maybe give bonus points if their article gets published to the library?<br />
<br />
@SL: I&#039;ll check it out later.<br />
<br />
Ah ok, I looked at their classes. So how they do it is you sign up for the class and when it starts, it goes on for a certain period of time with lectures and all. In the one I read about (Dreams and OBEs) there was a list of objectives that the student was expected to achieve by the time the class was finished. Doing this could help us give mroe details about the class.</div>

We should only archive the best assignments, though. Like a teacher who uses the best exam copy in the class to show the other students how the best did it.

I&#039;m not sure what you mean in that 4th paragraph... You mean making a kind of organized list on what skills should you have mastered as you go up in the ranks? Like in martial arts you need to know at least a certain set of techniques and forms before you can get the next sash?

EDIT: Oh, never mind I think I get it now XD You mean a list or something presenting the benefits of getting better, right?

By being taken note of, you mean they&#039;d get kind of a bonus point or two for taking the initiative of learning other things independently? That could work. Maybe give bonus points if their article gets published to the library?

@SL: I&#039;ll check it out later.

Ah ok, I looked at their classes. So how they do it is you sign up for the class and when it starts, it goes on for a certain period of time with lectures and all. In the one I read about (Dreams and OBEs) there was a list of objectives that the student was expected to achieve by the time the class was finished. Doing this could help us give mroe details about the class.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
