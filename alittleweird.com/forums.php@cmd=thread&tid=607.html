I just got done exploring the internet when I came across something called &quot;Photoreading&quot;. If you don&#039;t know what photoreading is, it&#039;s pretty much *supposedely* just unlocking your subconscious so that you can read 25,000 words per minute. So I wanted to ask you people what you think of it. I am thinking about buying a course, but I wanted to know what you guys though of it first.<br />

<br />
As far as actual reading is concerned, back in school I was able to easily finish one of the Harry Potter books within a day or so (and remember the contents), so photoreading seems kinda pointless to me, especially since in the day or so it takes for the information to settle in, I could&#039;ve just read the text and not had to worry about hypnosis or re-reading.<br />
<br />
Also, how many words are on a page? You&#039;d have to be flipping pages like crazy on smaller books to hit 25,000.</div>

By photoreading i think they are talking about a photographic memory type thing. I have a photographic memory and everyone else has one to an extent. I dont think 25,000 words per minute is likly but me i can look at a table of information in biology for not even a minute and be able to close my eyes and practically see it. I am not as good with an entire page of information type deal but numbers and table type deals i am good at. But with the website i wouldnt waste mony on that, no offense.  Back to the shadows for me...</div>

I believe he called it &quot;speed reading.&quot; He even gave a link to show how others could learn it which I&#039;ll look for later. <br />
The second place I heard of it was from my freshman English teacher. She mentioned that she learned how to do it because of a paper that was sent out to every English class. The paper had information about a class offering to teach speed reading. I actually wanted to go, but it costed around $200 and my mom didn&#039;t want to pay for it. :) </div>

I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever heard of the EyeQ method, but it&#039;s basically a speed reading course. Sort of like photoreading. I actually did the whole program and didn&#039;t gain anything from it. What they do is give you a reading test every session and then another one at the end of the session showing how you improved. It was a scam because the first reading test involves a story or information you&#039;ve never heard about or read before and the end of session test involves a very popular subject or story like the Wizard Of Oz or something as popular. So of course you end up reading the second story faster because you already know it and the graph shows how you improved when actually you&#039;re just skimming a story you already know. <br />
Anyway, I went a little long with that, but just wanted to say that you should probably save your money. And if you really do want to learn how to photoread, you could probably find some good books at the library for free. And just one more thing about speed reading, the best way to get fast at reading is to just practice, like anything else. </div>

So of course you end up reading the second story faster because you already know it and the graph shows how you improved when actually you&#039;re just skimming a story you already know. 
Anyway, I went a little long with that, but just wanted to say that you should probably save your money. And if you really do want to learn how to photoread, you could probably find some good books at the library for free. And just one more thing about speed reading, the best way to get fast at reading is to just practice, like anything else.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

But I am attempting to start that back up and get through it to see if it does what is says it does. As side note though, if you go through the book and just take out the photoreading step you have a fairly good reading system in and of it self, that is if you have problems with comprehension.<br />
<br />
As I do not yet know whether this is worth your money, and for all of those that are curious, you can get the personal learning course from here. Just get it from the RapidShare links, and don&#039;t forget the password listed at the end of the description when extracting.<br />

So why not give it a go with the whole course first before buying to decide if it really works for you or not. And if it does, then buy it. At least thats how I see these kinds of things, just because you never know what is the real deal what is just crap.</div>

		<div id="post_12199" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I know I&#039;ve not been active for a long time, but I&#039;d just like to say that I was taught this on some sort of gifted and talented summer school when I was about 12... I tried to photoread a French dictionary. And I honestly don&#039;t know whether it worked at all or not. But I do have an impressive French vocabulary, and when I&#039;m learning new words in French it almost feels like I&#039;m remembering them. In short, I haven&#039;t got a clue how much it worked, if at all, but I remember that some people had some results. I think it&#039;s worth trying to draw your own conclusions.<br />
<br />
Also, the technique didn&#039;t seem to be that hard. It was just a kind of meditation, followed by staring at the inside spine of the book and clearing your mind, then holding that whilst you turn the pages. The theory is that your subconscious can take a kind of picture of each page. Perhaps I should try it again.</div>

After that step, you have to recall it (and there is a technique for that), because aparently, after you photoread something, you have no conscience knowledge of it.

I have been looking into another reading system called Reading Genius 2.0. From the sound of it, it seems like it might be similar to Photoreading. So I am going to give it a try.<br />
