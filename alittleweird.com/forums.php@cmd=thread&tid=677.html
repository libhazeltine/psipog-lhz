This video has been posted before, in the Weird Videos forum, but that&#039;s not really the focus of this thread.<br />
This man, John Chang can not only electrokinesis (not a universally liked term, I know, but it seems fitting) and pyrokinesis <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aos0hnwiHt8" target="_blank" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aos0hnwiHt8">but several other impressive manifestations.</a><br />
<br />
Now, he does this by combining two types of &#039;chi&#039; and says they come from what I think are Chakra points (correct me if I am wrong). In psionics, by utilizing a different paradigm and method, we can produce similar results.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a theory I am considering: Chi, Chakra, Psi, these are all the same thing, each simply with a different take on the world. An empirical example of this would be religion, with several groups of people coming up with different conclusions and methodologies for the same fundamental purpose; explaining the world.<br />
<br />
OK, religion might not be the best example, but the point is that there are so many similarities, especially in chi and psi, that is it more likely that there are multiple similar somethings or that they are one and the same.<br />
<br />
Anything in this post is open to discussion, I&#039;m trying to make a pretty active thread, so I&#039;d really like to hear what you think.</div>

And that the only difference between any of them is the difference people make in their minds about them. So really, we should be able to apply all of the different ideas and paradigms from the other systems and do many of the same kinds of things that the other systems can do, just inside the understanding of whatever system you are using, so you would not have to learn the others in their totality to be able to get them to work for you. Hopefully that elaboration was of suffecient clarity.</div>

When doing anything with psi/chi/ki/prana/etc. you &quot;waste&quot; your energy. One has certain amount of energy in his/her body, and when it&#039;s used one may guess what happens.

When speaking about leeching another persons energy, one is just lying :) Well, not so to speak lying, but it&#039;s not from another person, but it&#039;s from the whole universe which has unlimited amount of energy to be used. It&#039;s possible that if your energy &quot;needs&quot; are huge at some moment, then via resonance the person you&#039;re &quot;leeching&quot; from, feels tired or loss of energy or what ever.<br />

		<div id="post_13076" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve seen a couple of John Chang threads on this forum so I will fill you in on some details..<br />
<br />
I highly recommend reading the book &quot;The Magus of Java&quot; by Kosta Danaos, as it is about this man you see in the first post, John Chang. Kosta Danaos was a student of his and he decided to write a book about him with John&#039;s consent.<br />
<br />
If the author is to be trusted then I think you will find the book quite interesting.<br />
<br />
According to the book Chi has both Yin and Yang components, and that it is the interaction between the two that makes life possible. Although most people thought yin and yang are just concepts, according to the book they are pretty much physical energies with different properties. Yang is in every object, and Yin supposedly comes from the Earth.<br />
<br />
This is a direct citation from the book:<br />
<br />
&quot;Inside our bodies, both flow in equal amounts. These energies are opposites, they can never meet. Yin and yang normally run parallel to each other, never letting go of one another. I use my yin and yang together as one; that is why I can do what I do. By itself, yang ch&#039;i cannot pass the limits of the body.&quot;<br />
<br />
John practices Neikung. It is written in the book that there are 72 different levels in this practice. You become level 1 when you fill your dantien (a point 3 to 4 inches below the navel, something like that) with yang chi to it&#039;s full capacity. In level 2 you compress the yang, and introduce twice as much into the same area. It is written in the book that you must be sexually abstinent to complete level two. <br />
<br />
In level 3 you make the dantien mobile. In level 4 you bring the yang from the dantien down to the hui yin and gather as much yin as you have yang down there. Then pull it up to the dantien (both yin and yang) if your lucky. It says in the book that many died before trying level 4 as it is very painful. <br />
<br />
Quote from the book for level 4:<br />
<br />
&quot;They float around inside the body, and the pain is incredible, constant, unbeliveable. Only if you have the discipline to ignore it can you control them and put their power inside your dantien.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every level from then is just doubling the energy inside you.<br />
<br />
John replenishes his chi by meditating. If i remember correctly (didn&#039;t have time to find it in the book) it takes about 81 hours of absolute meditation to fill up the dantien to it&#039;s full capacity.<br />
<br />
Be advised that the book does not offer techniques for this meditation, nor does it go in great detail about it. There is another book from the same author that supposedly reveals level 1, but I haven&#039;t read it yet so I&#039;m not sure about that.<br />
<br />
What else..<br />
<br />
Yes. John states that lighting the newspaper on fire was done with his yang chi. The properties of yin are somewhat different, it&#039;s a passive force which absorbs energy, something like that. John was able to resist air rifle pellets without injuries supposedly using his yin chi. This &quot;electricity&quot; you see him using in the video is done using both yin and yang. <br />
<br />
There are plenty more anecdotes in the book so I suggest reading it. <br />
