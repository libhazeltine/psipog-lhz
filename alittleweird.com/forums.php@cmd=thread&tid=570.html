<br />
My mom said goodnight to me and went off to bed. I watched a little TV for about an hour. When I went to bed, bits and pieces of my day just suddenly flowed into my head. All of the movies I watched on Youtube, things in science class, and more. Just slapped my upside the face. I tried to meditate off, but that didnt help. Then, I started calling myself insane throughout the night for no reason. I finally got up and walked over to my shelf. I had an urge to practice my tk for some reason. Perhaps I thought I had some sort of excess energy flow. When I reached for a bead on my shelf, I got this pen instead. And I could literally FEEL its energy. Like I was connected to it, yet repelling it. Like...A magnet. And it moved in all different directions. I could move objects heavier than usual with tk. I went from beads to pens/mini lucky japanese cats in one night. Then, it all stopped. I felt an adreneline rush because that was the most psychic ability I&#039;ve ever shown. This happened 3 times that night. And today, I figured out I can STILL move a pencil or something that wieght.</div>

I feel a bit out of my depth with this, as I&#039;ve never experienced anything like it. Try putting shielding up to block the extra sensory input untill you&#039;re ready for it. Look for intruders in your mind; thoughts and ideas that don&#039;t belong. Find their source and send it away to the light.<br />
<br />
Good for you that you&#039;ve managed to move up from the bead. A good exercise right now might be placing a double or triple A battery on the table and attempting to roll it in a specific direction. <br />
<br />
If you feel like practicing finesse, get a padlock and try applying force with a screwdriver and picking it with your TK. Useful skill.<br />

I still can&#039;t get the Psiwheel to spin under glass, and I&#039;ve been practicing for six years.</div>

@Akio: Thanks again. I do question some, however I have seen many wierd things as a kid and therefore I usually believe everything in the paranormal phenomena area.

But thats my 2 cents.<br />

@Goggle Hat: What d oyou mean by control? Well...There IS this male voice inside my head that I know isnt my sub-c. He keeps saying. &quot;You insane person. Your insane. *my name here*, your insane you even had to go to therapy and you know it&quot; and so on...He&#039;s gone now...Before I do anything else, I&#039;m trying to get stuff to move without being placed in the palm of my hand. As for the tk trouble, I never liked the psiwheel. Thats why I used beads. Lightweight, easy to roll. (P.S Gogglehat...on a psi forum...You dont play Psychonauts do you?)</div>

As for my TK problems, I&#039;m pretty sure they stem from a bad practice schedule, even though earlier this year I practiced like clockwork for three months. Before and since then I&#039;ve been practicing at different times.

Lastly, yes, I&#039;ve played Psychonauts, but that&#039;s not where my name comes from. I call myself Goggle Hat because I wear a hat with goggles on it.

Any voices in your head calling you crazy are not good for you. They are likely not your subconscious. I&#039;d be willing to bet money that those voices are not your subconscious. Kick them out. You should be able to. Since you can&#039;t actually kick your subconscious out of your head, trying won&#039;t hurt you. </div>
