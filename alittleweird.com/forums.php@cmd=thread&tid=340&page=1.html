		<div id="post_7871" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I was wondering, when we make our Psi-balls, manipulate things, use telepathy, what is this really? Long ago, we Used to Call this energy field that Surrounds us the Aether, a force that was essentially the cause of all motion. But When Albert Einstien&#039;s theories came to light, we dismissed the Aether, which was just a form of chaos, and proved it was acctually a Science, complex and accurate. with energy as the source. However, later in Albert Einstien&#039;s life, Quantum Physics became the newest topic of discussion. This dictated everything that was againt albert Einstiens beliefs, because it said that the subatomic level was dictated by chaos, which he believed was an&#039;unatural&#039; thing. Now, today, we are referring to what people would call the Aether before Einstiens time. I feel that we are backtracking, but I don&#039;t feel that anything said is flat out wrong. The idea is that Chaos Rules order, and Chaos is what people have called magic in order to bring order to it, harness and control it. to live.<br />
<br />
Now, I don&#039;t feel that Einstien was wrong, so I have come to the conclusion that this Chaos found at the subatomic level is just another form of order. Unfortunately, it is also my belief that any Order is open to manipulation. with every action we make, every wave of thought, everything. It&#039;s all an influence on this order, and with all of the influences we interpret it as a form of Chaos. The only thing I havent figured out is how exactly can we measure these things, what is the formula we can use to figure out how this manipulation happens? <br />
<br />
This, My Friends, People I&#039;ve known for all but 5 minutes of my Life, which is both nothing and everything to me, This is what I think to be the Next Frontier to cover, ad possibly the final. <br />
<br />
If my theories are correct, it is possible that I can put an explination to Psychic abilities. Explain things once dismissed by scientists as impossible.<br />
<br />
my goal is to Prove Psychic abilities as a reality and open up a new doorway into Discovery, and I have devoted my life to this, it&#039;s my Dream, My Goal, and my Very own Scientific Revolution.<br />
<br />
So, Any thoughts? I&#039;d like to hear as much as possible ^_^</div>

1-Other name for the gas &quot;nitrous oxide&quot; also called &quot;laughing gas&quot;.<br />

<br />
The &#039;Aether&#039; number 2 doesn&#039;t exist and that was proven by Albert Einstein. The &#039;Aether&#039; number 3 and 1 still exist, but nº 3 have a different name. &quot;Aether&quot; cames from greek and means &quot;pure air&quot;, that makes the word ambiguos.<br />

About your theory, I think Chaos theory is wrong, but there is so much variables, that is difficult to predict what will happen. It&#039;s like Einstein said &quot;God don&#039;t play with dice&quot;.<br />

The gas is spelled &quot;ether&quot; never aether.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the Aether concept, referred to as the &quot;Luminiferous Aether&quot; was originally the logically assumed medium for which light (and all energy) propagated.  Indeed in the early 1900&#039;s, physicists including Einstein refined our theories to exclude the need for the Aether.  But note the wording.  The Aether was never disproved.  <br />
<br />
Einstein himself said in the 1920 paper &quot;Aether and the Theory of Relativity&quot;  -- <em>&quot;More careful reflection teaches us, however, that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether.&quot; </em>and<em> &quot;To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever&quot;.</em> <br />
<br />
It served its purpose by giving us a &quot;fundamental platform&quot; and we grew from that.  Interestingly enough, once wave/particle duality was understood, the role of the Aether changed.  It being a horribly archaic concept in the modern world, we were quick to dismiss the term.  But as we delved deeper into our understanding, we once again saw the need for an &quot;all-pervading fundamental energy&quot; from which reality is supported.

The gas is spelled &quot;ether&quot; never aether.

Secondly, the Aether concept, referred to as the &quot;Luminiferous Aether&quot; was originally the logically assumed medium for which light (and all energy) propagated.  Indeed in the early 1900&#039;s, physicists including Einstein refined our theories to exclude the need for the Aether.  But note the wording.  The Aether was never disproved.  

Einstein himself said in the 1920 paper &quot;Aether and the Theory of Relativity&quot;  -- [i]&quot;More careful reflection teaches us, however, that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether.&quot; [/i]and[i] &quot;To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever&quot;.[/i] 

It served its purpose by giving us a &quot;fundamental platform&quot; and we grew from that.  Interestingly enough, once wave/particle duality was understood, the role of the Aether changed.  It being a horribly archaic concept in the modern world, we were quick to dismiss the term.  But as we delved deeper into our understanding, we once again saw the need for an &quot;all-pervading fundamental energy&quot; from which reality is supported.  Concepts like &quot;the Medium, Zero-Point Energy and the active vacuum&quot; exist today calling forth energy from the &quot;time-domain.&quot;  Everywhere you look in quantum mechanics, you see reference to scalars and active energies.  Realms of potentials and seas of possibilities.

<br />
Put simply, I feel that the aether wasn&#039;tt ever wrong, but that it was on a smaller plane that what we have thought about. <br />
<br />
My Idea here is that Psi is actually the driving force behind the Forming of Quarks, which are the Foundation of Protons, electrons, and neutrons. My thought is that it&#039;s not really randomness, but open to influence by other forms of energy. like a subatomic version of what we have already established, but open to more influences because of the size that we are dealing with.<br />
<br />
Because of this, energies that our brains could produce could effect the natural flow of this force and bend it to our whim.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not Saying we&#039;re backtracking because of referring to Psi as real, I&#039;m saying we&#039;re backtracking because you&#039;re trying to put it along the same level as normal physics.<br />
<br />
What I&#039;ve noticed along that line as well is that when you try to state that Aether is at the atomic level, you end up fighting an uphill battle. Mainly that is because the Deffinition of Aether, if you tell a scientist that it&#039;s the atomic level, then he&#039;ll think, for one, that you&#039;re a fool who doesn&#039;t know basic physics, and two, that what you&#039;re acctually reffering to is an Archaic term for Energy, which has a much simpler (or rather, more easily measured) pattern of movement.<br />

Sorry for not making myself clear earlier, my thought was in a jumble and I wanted to much to put the information out there. Seems I didn&#039;t get everything across.</div>

		<div id="post_7903" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So many times people wind up disagreeing on a subject but it turns out it&#039;s only on the level of semantics and not concepts.  Depending on who you talk to (and their educational history)  Terms like Aether, Psi, Chaos Energy, and the sort have different meanings.  They were introduced to them in different ways and they integrated the concepts in to their paradigms differently.<br />
<br />
That being said, I agree with what I think it is you are saying, but I have taken a bit more time to be more careful with the wording.  ^__^<br />
<br />
I regard &quot;psi&quot; in the same way &quot;wind&quot; is.  There is no &quot;thing&quot; called wind.  It is just moving air.  By that same token &quot;potential energy controlled by the mind&quot; is what I deem &quot;psi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Psi is a very neutral term but it can get brought in to take the place of other (more appropriate) terms to give the subject a mystique and class that &quot;guards&quot; it from empirical testing.<br />
<br />
In any event, most of the data I have (and that&#039;s a lot) suggests that the very framework that allows for physicality itself and the passage of time is what allows for our mind to impregnate our thoughts and intent on to our environment and commit changes for future events.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this:<br />
<br />
Quantum mechanics suggests that something &quot;isn&#039;t until it is.&quot; and &quot;until it IS it could be anything.&quot;  Now obviously that&#039;s a gross over-simplification of probability and likelihood but it serves the point. ^__^<br />
<br />
History describes the passage of &quot;something&quot; through time.  The arrangement of information from the past will describe the likely future state of the &quot;thing&quot; in the next frame of time.  Now, looking ahead, the further you get into the future, the less exact, and likely, the future states become.  The lines of probability diverge hyperbolically on to infinity.<br />
<br />
Now, &quot;permanence&quot; can be described as &quot;adequate information describing future states.&quot;  If you place an object on the table, it is there.  There is adequate history to describe it being there and it will continue to be there until action is taken to change that.  This is in stark contrast to the photons that we see &quot;pop&quot; into existence from an unknown source.  They have basically no history to describe where they appear let alone their trajectory or even their physical properties.  They could show up anywhere in the universe.  Interestingly enough, many theorize that they appear mostly where we expect to &quot;see&quot; them. ^__^<br />
<br />
All change needs energy.  Energy does the &quot;work&quot; of change and information &quot;describes&quot; that change.  <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go much deeper into this as it (the possible mechanism for psionics) is a bit lengthly.  I WILL say however that the data suggests strongly that the mind matter interaction is built on configuring potential energy (from the &quot;wherever&quot;) with thought (information) to predicate &quot;custom&quot; future states of matter.  And the broader the change, the more energy that is needed.<br />
<br />
The &quot;source&quot; of this energy (possibly all energy) when manipulated by the mind, is what we call &quot;Psi.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t call the power coming from my wall socket &quot;hydroelectricity&quot; even though that&#039;s what it is.  It was generated at a hydroelectric power plant using the energy of flowing water.  It&#039;s just &quot;power.&quot;<br />
<br />
On a semantic level &quot;psi&quot; is just &quot;energy;&quot; the same energy that is with everything else.  The qualifying factor here is that it was catalyzed using the mind.  But as you go deeper and look at other energy interactions, even those that exclude the mind, &quot;psi&quot; starts to get watered down.<br />
<br />
Still, what is important is not the words, but the data.  The Experiments.  The concepts.<br />
<br />
We have only just begun and I personally can see a wondrous future. ^__^<br />

I think there are real keys to the motion, one is feeling the link between the object you&#039;re trying to move. Unfortunately, I have no Solid proof of how it&#039;s done. It&#039;s not really that psions aren&#039;t accurate in their research, nor that they aren&#039;t having valid experiences. It&#039;s just that we as a whole, with a few exceptions, can&#039;t document everything in the detail that is required.<br />

There is another issue with the fact that magicians document the magic tricks that give the illusion of telekenisis much better and with more effect, but that&#039;s another issue for another time.<br />

I think there are real keys to the motion, one is feeling the link between the object you&#039;re trying to move. Unfortunately, I have no Solid proof of how it&#039;s done. It&#039;s not really that psions aren&#039;t accurate in their research, nor that they aren&#039;t having valid experiences. It&#039;s just that we as a whole, with a few exceptions, can&#039;t document everything in the detail that is required.

There is another issue with the fact that magicians document the magic tricks that give the illusion of telekenisis much better and with more effect, but that&#039;s another issue for another time.

<br />
I have experienced, first-hand, PK done in person both by myself and my colleagues countless times.  The analysis of this phenomena has brought many theories to the table but so far one has been able to be tested much more successfully than any of the others.  That theory ... is for another discussion later.  ^__^<br />
<br />
However, the gist of it describes that when a mind observes an object, the mental counterpart links with the physical counterpart on an information level.  The changes you cause to the entangled counterpart in your mind will be communicated to the physical object in tandem.  Provided there is enough available energy to execute the changes, the next future moments in time will be created reflecting those changes.<br />
<br />
Basically, we write &quot;an addendum to the future&quot; that commits the changes we visualize.<br />
<br />
This theory has held up to lots of testing though there currently doesn&#039;t exist a means to directly observe this interaction.<br />
<br />
The key is having enough available energy to fuel the actions.<br />
<br />
With grass-roots PK, there is often enough available energy for tiny effects like moving wheels and such.  Gravity can be seen as a &quot;potential vector&quot; where being able to affect the trajectory of this energy AS potential, you can use the natural properties of the material to move it.<br />
<br />
But most people when moving on to larger things hit a wall.  I suspect this is due to inadequate energy for the action.<br />
<br />
A small foil psi-wheel has very little friction to impede the rotation, but the metal has adequate density to &quot;carry&quot; gravity.<br />
<br />
If you are curious, this is possibly why it seems that a foil psi wheel is superior to a paper one.  Wad a square of paper and a square of foil into a ball and flick it.  The foil feels much denser even though there is less &quot;volume&quot; or material.<br />
<br />
An independent researcher, Mel Winfield, has a theory of &quot;Nucleonic Energy&quot; which basically uses a &quot;special&quot; electromagnetic field to manipulate the trajectory of particles in atoms to &quot;shift their velocity&quot; in desired directions.<br />
<br />
This is a much more complex, yet similar theory.<br />
<br />
In any event, at this stage of the game, we are pretty confident in our theories as to HOW PK works.  Right now, we are working on how to produce an excess of the &quot;potential energy&quot; needed to fuel some very large and grandiose PK effects.  By having a &quot;freedom of energy,&quot; we will be able to investigate the mechanism much easier and with more affect.  No more, &quot;maybe the wind blew the wheel&quot; but instead &quot;I need my sunglasses to view this flared psi ball!  Steve!  Stop levitating that small-block Chevy engine and come over here and see this!&quot;<br />

I agree with this Erik, but, I have another idea that could also be a possibility. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about leverage. We can put energy into an action to move something. But, we all know that with proper leverage, or a better leverage, we can move the said object with less energy needed. So, my idea is that maybe we do not actually need more energy to move a larger object, but need some type of better &quot;leverage.&quot; I do not know how exactly to obtain more leverage on moving bigger objects, it may work the same way as moving a door with your hand--pushing farthest to the opposite side of the hinges, or, in PK terms to move a larger object it could require a stronger connection between the person and object. </div>

<br />
If a certain amount of energy (work) is required to move an object, then that&#039;s how much is needed.  Leverage allows you to distribute the mechanical force to require less &quot;effort,&quot; not less total &quot;work&quot;.<br />
<br />

It could be seen as using leverage or other techniques to make more efficient use of the energy at hand.<br />

I can easily move a psiwheel, given that I&#039;m focussed on the taskat hand, but there are to many factors that could be used to Explain the effects hen it comes to Pk. So I guess I was Wrong in saying that I&#039;ve never seen Pk in action, rather, that I can&#039;t be sure that I have.</div>
