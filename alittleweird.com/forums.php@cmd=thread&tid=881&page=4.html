Oh, and I retract my vote for the &quot;Psion Academy&quot; name. &quot;The Akashic Records&quot; just sounds much better.

Cool name, of course, but not really suited for a school that wants to teach people Psionics, instead of Magic. ;)<br />

And Supernatural School, that just sounds bad. Especially since what we&#039;re doing is in NO way supernatural. It&#039;s absolutely natural, the universal laws we use are just not recognised by modern science at the moment.<br />
