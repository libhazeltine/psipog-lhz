So sometimes when I go to bed and sleep, I&#039;d have a lucid dream. I&#039;d have them about 1-2 a month. But, I&#039;m having sn issue:<br />
<br />
Say, I&#039;m in a dream in my school, and I realize I&#039;m dreaming. Normally when this would happen, I&#039;d yell out, &quot;I&#039;M DREAMING, WOO-HOO!!!&quot;. :-P  But than, my friends would go, &quot;No you&#039;re not you idiot.&quot;. And, I&#039;d prove them wrong by altering the dream world. Here&#039;s the problem. Sometimes, I can&#039;t. I can&#039;t control anything. It&#039;s like... Bah, it&#039;s hard to explain... It&#039;s like, I&#039;m dreaming of HAVING a lucid dream, but I&#039;m still not in control. Sorry if this makes no sense, it&#039;s hard to describe it. Anyone know what&#039;s wrong/thing they could help?</div>

 With that mind, maybe you could try telling yourself what very obvious dream signs you would like to appear in your dreams, or even more simply just say that you want to be lucid. Then, go to sleep.</div>

I remember waking up (in my dream) and getting out of bed thinking, &quot;hmm, this feels like I&#039;m dreaming still&quot; so I figured I&#039;d prove it to myself by levitating myself - it didn&#039;t work so I went back to &quot;sleep&quot;.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s happened more than once and I think the reason you can&#039;t control anything is because you don&#039;t believe you can.  I was pretty much convinced in my dream that I wasn&#039;t dreaming, but just to check I tried levitating.  However when I&#039;m completely aware that I&#039;m definitely dreaming it&#039;s much easier to affect things.<br />
<br />
So take a moment to say &quot;I am definitely dreaming&quot; and find a way to be sure of it before trying to make cool stuff happen, &#039;cause if you try and it doesn&#039;t work, you&#039;ll probably just convince yourself you&#039;re actually awake.</div>

In many of the dreams I have had I realize that I am dreaming and that I am using reasoning to figure things out, but then I quickly fall back into the sway of dream logic and become the spectator.

It&#039;s pretty normal dude. The fact that you have gotten that far is actually a pretty good sign. Don&#039;t give up :-D.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_7148" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I have had some similar experiences. I have been on and off trying to have a lucid dream for almost 2 years now (I obviously haven&#039;t practiced enough due to lack of time and stupid interruptions), and I have had 3 instances where I have achieved consciousness in a dream. The one time I was able to levitate before I woke up which was very exciting (although the dream was fuzzy and not as vivid as I had hoped), the second consisted of me being conscious during a nightmare which I could not change so I woke up, and the last was very peculiar. I was in my school and I realized this as an improbability because it was summer at the time so I said very vocally &quot;Ok, this is definitely a dream.&quot; and then all of a sudden one of my good friends came up to me and said &quot;No, it&#039;s not lets get to class.&quot; And i was very affirmative and said once more &quot;No, don&#039;t lie to me, I know that I am dreaming!&quot; and then my friend looked at me with  a disappointed look and then said to me &quot;Damn it, alright you win.&quot; and then The whole dream proceeded to change and I woke up very alert. This was probably the strangest experience I have ever had in a dream. *I am sorry if these were too long I just thought it may be of some help to hear other stories and maybe get feedback on my own*</div>

Sometimes I even start to question my dreams &quot;dreaminess&quot; AFTER I have done something horrible. Of course the support cast in my dreams plays along with my doubts, and way too often I end up waking up being grateful that it was just a dream afterall. =P<br />

If your mid creates a barrier there it would work in much of the same way. Is this reasonable?</div>

		<div id="post_7378" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">When I think about lucid dreaming while I’m awake I have a very strong feeling of fear due to a problem I’ve been experiencing during lucid dreams. When I become lucid in a dream that feeling comes back, and I’m then very conscious. <br />
<br />
Somehow I feel like my consciousness has something to do with this emotion I have. So maybe, just maybe ( and this is just a theory I’ll be testing out over the next few days) if you try to connect an emotion to your lucid dream, maybe even an emotional event, when you are lucid you may then think of this event (or feel) and this will help you stay lucid, and possibly then in control. To me it seems like an anchor, or a thread connecting me to reality.<br />

This is just a theory, it may be crap, I’ll be trying it, maybe you could. <br />
