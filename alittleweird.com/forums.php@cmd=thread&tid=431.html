<br />
you can relate better to something that is physical. something you can physically see and physically hold. the object itself holds not special power but it acts like an &quot;anchor&quot; that will always bring you back to what the stone was manifested to be.<br />
<br />
for instance I for a long time wore a pure white quartz stone. I wore it because i felt depressed and uncomfortable a lot of the time. the white was a soothing color and also i would hold it in my hand and think of all of the things that made me feel better, &quot;anchoring&quot; those feelings to the stone. <br />
<br />
whenever i would go to hold the stone, i would automatically think of those things because it brought me back to the first time I did it. After a while I would completely forgo the thoughts of what made me happy when I held the stone and automatically BE happy just from holding the stone because I trained my mind to react that way. A physical manifestation of good feelings.<br />
<br />
this is the same case with psi. if you infuse your energy into the object &quot;anchoring&quot; what you know or what you believe so every time you see or feel the object you&#039;ll automatically  be remembered of what you anchored to the point that what you anchored happens automatically from training your mind.</div>

		<div id="post_9989" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I am a firm believer in gemstones and crystals.<br />
Now, that&#039;s not to say that they have magic powers or anything. But I do believe they can help to channel certain energies in the user.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an idea that felt natural to me since the first crystal I owned. I&#039;ve since done some research on their uses as healing stones and put their methods to practice with a good deal of success. Unfortunately, the only scientific basis I&#039;ve ever come across as to why they work, is something about the patterned molecular structure of the gemstones somehow storing energy at unique frequency levels. Not sure how sound that claim is.<br />
<br />
I agree, however, that they do work fundamentally in the same manner as any talisman or charm. Maybe the advantage of using crystals is just that it&#039;s easier to distinguish which stone is for which purpose by their color or type =) (Plus, they&#039;re pretty!)</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9989">I am a firm believer in gemstones and crystals.
Now, that&#039;s not to say that they have magic powers or anything. But I do believe they can help to channel certain energies in the user.

It&#039;s an idea that felt natural to me since the first crystal I owned. I&#039;ve since done some research on their uses as healing stones and put their methods to practice with a good deal of success. Unfortunately, the only scientific basis I&#039;ve ever come across as to why they work, is something about the patterned molecular structure of the gemstones somehow storing energy at unique frequency levels. Not sure how sound that claim is.

Esro. Which gems have showed what? Like did a certain one have certain outcomes? I&#039;m becoming interested in this now, and might purchase one.<br />

Which would you recommend? And anyone else?</div>

Which gems have showed what? Like did a certain one have certain outcomes?</div>I have a book on which gemstones are most effective for which purposes, and the general uses seem to be pretty consistent. For example, rose quartz is often linked to friendships or love matters, and I believe emotional perception. Clear crystal quartz is most related to psychic abilities such as astral projection, intuition, visualization, and other things like divination (crystal balls).<br />
<br />
The color can also tell you about its probable uses, as the color of the stone corresponds to its chakra color. Amethyst, which is a deep purple, matches the crown chakra and is thus well suited to intuition, perception, and dream exercises.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t use them very often for psi activities, though I sleep with a quartz and amethyst by my pillow when I&#039;m trying to focus on dream work or OBEs.<br />
<br />
As for which I&#039;d recommend, Jeffrey, for a first crystal I&#039;d suggest any of the ones I mentioned, as their uses are varied and can be helpful in many situations. But it might also be a good idea to check out the selection at a store and just pick out whichever attracts you the most, either by feeling or whichever you think looks prettiest. =)<br />
<br />
Most of the information about which stones are used for what can be found on the internet, as well as how to care for them and charge them with energy. I&#039;d be happy to answer any other questions you (or anyone) may have =)</div>
