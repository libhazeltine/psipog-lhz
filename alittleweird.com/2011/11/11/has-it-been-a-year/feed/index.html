		<description>I first found Psipog when I was maybe 14 or 15. I'm 21 now. It's been fun reading these over the years, and I'll certainly be sad to see them slowly end. I never was terribly active on Psipog or here, but it's like you said: I moved on.

I'm glad I found this place, though. I think perhaps it might have been partly the ideas this place held for me that convinced me to switch my major from Computer Engineering to Psychology. Maybe they didn't influence me at all, but whatever the reason I'm certainly happier and doing better school-wise than I ever was as a CprE major. I'm definitely willing to attribute that to the time I spent here. :)

Good luck with your family and the rest of your endeavors, whatever they turn out to be. :)</description>

		<description>Your blogs are always interesting to read. I always thought psionics is something useful in our daily life, but I guess we always have to come back to face other things. It might be good to let go, I know that letting go is different from giving up. Good luck then, Sean.</description>

		<description>First of all, I wish you the best of luck Sean for the present and future.  The experiments and experience you gone through in the psionic phase was really challenging to modern science.  Even though you were weird to the outside world, you were always happy with your own inner world.

I personally learned many thing from your articles, and I have a great respect to you and your team.  If I was in at your location, probably I would prefered to meet you personally.  I alwasy appreciate your effort always.

Lastly,  I would like suggest you, please ensure that these articles are handy on the internet.  This may help other newbies to learn and get educated about these concepts.  Your team's experiences are valuable which may be useful to 1000s of people around the world who could see the probablity beyond science.

Take Care and Grow Rich

Regards,
SathyaKantha</description>

		<description>Optimism has me curious of the possibility that in the far future this site will be used as an example of a time when people first attempted to use their minds for purposes previously unknown.

It's been great to have been a part of this site!  
(..Though I sure say the weirdest things, sometimes.)</description>

		<description>These "phases" that you talk about, Sean, are an essential necessity for life. Were it not for phases how could the caterpillar become the monarch butterfly? These phases allow for progressive stages for growth. And in your case Sean, I'd say these "phases" have shaped your spiritual development. After all, where would your psyche be if it lacked all your psychic experiences? You'd probably be a "muggle". Haha. :)

All people grow through "phases" at one point or another in their lives. It's inevitable. Therein lies wisdom with such occurrences. These opportunities allow us to acquire perfections of all sorts, and just what are these perfections? Human virtues.

The highest attainments humanity can ever reach is at the summit of spiritual qualities. The characteristic virtues I'm talking about but not limited to are: benevolence, compassion, truthfulness, courage, enlightenment, generosity, wisdom, patience, forbearance, humility, etc. Everyone is in possession of these qualities but of course to varying degrees. It is the varying of these degrees that creates such illusions as inequality and injustice. One person may have the portion of a cupful while another has the equivalent of a boundless sea. Every human being has his/her own unique, innate capacities.

It is only through earnest striving and sincere devotion that we can ever adequately develop ourselves to the highest degrees of refinement. Day by day, little by little, inch by inch; it is possible to become better. Cultivation of virtues also leads to the proper application of psychic potentials. This is what the Buddha did. So to everyone out there: Take your "phases" to the next level. Cheers.

PS: Sean, have you had any OBE's lately?</description>

		<description>I have always been frustrated by those that attempt to devalue things I hold to be valuable. Just because it is not a part of their reality, or they think that valuing something like that is immature, or some such. 

Anyhow, I wish you the best of luck Sean for the present and future. I am glad I was able to share in a small part in the journey that has unfolded from all of this.

Remember Sean, never stop growing in the various multi-facated ways people do.</description>
