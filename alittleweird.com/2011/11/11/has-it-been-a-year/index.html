				<p>Ah, 11/11&#8230;/11!</p>
<p>Surely I must have something important to share on this once-in-a-century date?!</p>
<p>No&#8230; not particularly :-P.  I can&#8217;t imagine too many people will end up reading this anyways, which is fine by me.</p>
<p>The only thing remotely psionics-related I&#8217;ve been doing is attempting to unwire my thoughts concerning empathy.  I discovered a term called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency" target="_blank">codependency</a>&#8220;, which does a great job at explaining the mental processes of (what I call) empathy.  If you find yourself a victim of empathy, perhaps researching codependency will help you.  It&#8217;s helped me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on archiving PsiPog and ALW to a single download of the appropriate HTML/CSS files.  I plan on putting this file on PsiPog.net, leaving it up for a year or two, then taking the site down completely.  We&#8217;ve had a good run&#8230; these websites were a big part of my teens and 20&#8217;s.  I&#8217;m 28 now&#8230; about to get married and start a family.  I&#8217;m glad to have helped a lot of people, but there comes a point when you have to move on. I hope to have the download available within the next couple months.</p>
<p>When I first started getting into the paranormal, when I was 15, my father told it me was just a phase.  I hated that.  I guess it&#8217;s something a parent tells themselves when their child gets into something weird, whether it be obnoxious music, or dressing a particular way, or trying to move things with their mind :-P.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a phase, but I don&#8217;t hate that it was a phase &#8212; I hated that &#8220;just a phase&#8221; was used to devalue my thoughts and feelings.  Oh, you believe something weird?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you are doing lots of research?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you&#8217;ve found scientific evidence?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you&#8217;ve seen it with your own eyes?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  It&#8217;s this attitude of devaluing that I hate.</p>
<p>Psionics was a phase&#8230; a long phase :-P.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t valuable.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that it was all bullshit.  I have seen and done things that modern science cannot explain.  I feel proud of that.  It has helped me to deal with <em>being weird</em>&#8230; and finding other weird people in this world to relate to.  It&#8217;s pushed me towards self-growth and becoming a good person.</p>
<p>Everything is a phase&#8230; it just depends on the scale.  This human life is a phase we will all get over some day.  Psionics is what you make of it.  No one has the right to minimize something important to you.  That doesn&#8217;t mean you have the right to bully people with your beliefs either &#8212; it just means we should strive for mutual respect.</p>
<p>Happy 11/11/11!  Someday you will outgrow whatever it is you find valuable today.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t valuable today.</p>

			<p>I have always been frustrated by those that attempt to devalue things I hold to be valuable. Just because it is not a part of their reality, or they think that valuing something like that is immature, or some such. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I wish you the best of luck Sean for the present and future. I am glad I was able to share in a small part in the journey that has unfolded from all of this.</p>
<p>Remember Sean, never stop growing in the various multi-facated ways people do.</p>

			<p>These &#8220;phases&#8221; that you talk about, Sean, are an essential necessity for life. Were it not for phases how could the caterpillar become the monarch butterfly? These phases allow for progressive stages for growth. And in your case Sean, I&#8217;d say these &#8220;phases&#8221; have shaped your spiritual development. After all, where would your psyche be if it lacked all your psychic experiences? You&#8217;d probably be a &#8220;muggle&#8221;. Haha. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>All people grow through &#8220;phases&#8221; at one point or another in their lives. It&#8217;s inevitable. Therein lies wisdom with such occurrences. These opportunities allow us to acquire perfections of all sorts, and just what are these perfections? Human virtues.</p>
<p>The highest attainments humanity can ever reach is at the summit of spiritual qualities. The characteristic virtues I&#8217;m talking about but not limited to are: benevolence, compassion, truthfulness, courage, enlightenment, generosity, wisdom, patience, forbearance, humility, etc. Everyone is in possession of these qualities but of course to varying degrees. It is the varying of these degrees that creates such illusions as inequality and injustice. One person may have the portion of a cupful while another has the equivalent of a boundless sea. Every human being has his/her own unique, innate capacities.</p>
<p>It is only through earnest striving and sincere devotion that we can ever adequately develop ourselves to the highest degrees of refinement. Day by day, little by little, inch by inch; it is possible to become better. Cultivation of virtues also leads to the proper application of psychic potentials. This is what the Buddha did. So to everyone out there: Take your &#8220;phases&#8221; to the next level. Cheers.</p>
<p>PS: Sean, have you had any OBE&#8217;s lately?</p>

			<p>Optimism has me curious of the possibility that in the far future this site will be used as an example of a time when people first attempted to use their minds for purposes previously unknown.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been great to have been a part of this site!<br />

			<p>First of all, I wish you the best of luck Sean for the present and future.  The experiments and experience you gone through in the psionic phase was really challenging to modern science.  Even though you were weird to the outside world, you were always happy with your own inner world.</p>
<p>I personally learned many thing from your articles, and I have a great respect to you and your team.  If I was in at your location, probably I would prefered to meet you personally.  I alwasy appreciate your effort always.</p>
<p>Lastly,  I would like suggest you, please ensure that these articles are handy on the internet.  This may help other newbies to learn and get educated about these concepts.  Your team&#8217;s experiences are valuable which may be useful to 1000s of people around the world who could see the probablity beyond science.</p>
<p>Take Care and Grow Rich</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

			<p>I always read what you write, sad that its ending.<br />
Sad.. but there&#8217;s beer. Alot of beer.<br />
Psipog played a fucking huge part in my life, I&#8217;m going to keep the archive of it with the rest of my lifetime haul I&#8217;m transferring from one computer to another, three hdd&#8217;s at a time. Ha ha. I should write once I sober up</p>

			<p>Your blogs are always interesting to read. I always thought psionics is something useful in our daily life, but I guess we always have to come back to face other things. It might be good to let go, I know that letting go is different from giving up. Good luck then, Sean.</p>

			<p>I first found Psipog when I was maybe 14 or 15. I&#8217;m 21 now. It&#8217;s been fun reading these over the years, and I&#8217;ll certainly be sad to see them slowly end. I never was terribly active on Psipog or here, but it&#8217;s like you said: I moved on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I found this place, though. I think perhaps it might have been partly the ideas this place held for me that convinced me to switch my major from Computer Engineering to Psychology. Maybe they didn&#8217;t influence me at all, but whatever the reason I&#8217;m certainly happier and doing better school-wise than I ever was as a CprE major. I&#8217;m definitely willing to attribute that to the time I spent here. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Good luck with your family and the rest of your endeavors, whatever they turn out to be. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
