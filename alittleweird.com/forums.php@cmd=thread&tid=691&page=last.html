If the dream is only messing with the past, it doesn&#039;t help us at all. We were there; the dream is only reviewing what happened in a strange and twisted way, if even at all. If the dream said something about the future, however, then they would be slightly more useful. Some people believe they do speak of the future. Still, my thoughts on this is negative as well.

I&#039;ve had my share of clear visions. Just a few weeks ago there was a fire in my neighborhood. 4 nights before that I kept have a same dream. Me running out of the house after smelling smoke, and looking to my RIGHT. Then, I see it. A fire so big, it lit up half the sky.  I ran to see if I could help them when it exploded (not the big explosions in the movies, just a small bang) I see a garden hose near the house. I turn on the water and start spraying it. I scream for help but my call doesn&#039;t go past the &#039;somebody&#039; Something just exploded in my face. I&#039;m dead. Dream ends. It goes like this for another night. But the third night, I don&#039;t do anything This was happening around 4:00 AM. But anyways...A firetruck speeds past me as I watch on helplessly.  Dream ended right there. The FOURTH night, I tried to save the house, and I died. Again. Now I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s absolutely no possible way this was a coincidence. 4 friggen nights of that damn nightmare and then ****! I&#039;m back in the nightmare. Only this time, if I die, I stay dead. O.O 3rd friggen dream came real.</div>
