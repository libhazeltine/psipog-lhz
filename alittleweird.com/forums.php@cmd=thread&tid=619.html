<br />
as you might already have noticed, I&#039;m new to this forum.<br />
I already read lots of articles on PsiPog and was able to move the psi-wheel once. (I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m still able to move it, last time I tried it didn&#039;t really move) It&#039;s a bit sad that PsiPog isn&#039;t active anymore and I&#039;m also wondering where all the members went to.<br />
Btw, I&#039;m 16 years old and from Germany.<br />
<br />
I think a Phasing Thread does already exist, but since this page has no search function (or am I just too stupid to see it?^^) I open a new one.<br />
I read that Phasing could be dangerous, but in a Phasing Thread in the (inactive) PsiPog Forum there were a few people who could phase without pain or anything else. (For example maxus or PazarX, does anybody know if they are still active in any psi forum?)<br />
However, I don&#039;t want to try to phase my body, but some objects (for example a pencil) instead. My question is, how to do it. I didn&#039;t find an article on how to do that on PsiPog.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div>

There is nothing in modern understanding of physics that prevents time travel.<br />

<br />
Now, lets stand in (absolute) position X on earth and travel one minute into the future.<br />
<br />
Now, when we arrive 60 seconds later into that same &quot;absolute&quot; position in the universe, earth below us has moved and rotated in space at the speeds we know.<br />
<br />
So, we would have moved some distances along x,y and z axis in relation to earth, and thus achieved teleportation :P<br />
<br />
By definition, this is teleportation. <br />
defined as: &quot;When an object disappears from one place and reappears in another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Although it is still relative... Since the subject actually does not move at all during experience, but meh.</div>

<br />
It &quot;disappears&quot; now from point A, and &quot;appears&quot; X seconds later in a point B :P<br />
<br />
Both A and B are the same point in space, but with earth moving, we can abuse its speed to achieve effect. <br />
<br />
To get to point B, either you must move in relation to world, or the world must move in relation to you. The latter happens in the situation.<br />
<br />
So you would &quot;disapper&quot; from current time, and appear in the future at that exact point in space. <br />
<br />
Sadly this would only work with short times and shortish distances, since the earth is spinning and rotating around sun, which in turn is doing its own movement in the milky way.<br />
<br />
Some 2 weeks or a year long time travel in this manner would end you up hundreds of thousands of kilometers off the earth. Since you would  be moving instantly from this time to the next time.<br />
<br />
And for everything else, the time you were &quot;gone&quot; has caused different forces to affect their positions.<br />
<br />
Gotta patent this idea as soon as someone builds a time machine ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
And a graphical explanation to help visualization.<br />
