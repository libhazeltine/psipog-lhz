		<div id="post_9766" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">For awhile I have thought about this and I decided it was time to voice my opinion. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m simply projecting my own feelings onto everyone else, but from when I first found out about Psipog I was very lazy about training. Why? Well, I was a regular daydreaming kid. I had other things to do, and while psychic phenomenon was what I felt I cared about most, it was more of a daydream idea than something for me to actively pursue. I didn&#039;t feel like I could.<br />
<br />
The second thing that discouraged me was the condition of the community. Sure, the articles were written by friendly sounding people, but once I had read them and saw the terms they used I thought, &quot;Really? That&#039;s it? &quot; Psychic phenomenon was mysterious, and here I had these people who weren&#039;t even that developed themselves (by my super hero influenced standards) saying that it was this way.<br />
<br />
Then I visited the forums, and that&#039;s were it got old. Most of the forum goers were just like me: Little kids, or much worse, people who thought they knew everything. Everyone had a theory, and plenty of them really thought ONLY MY THEORY IS CORRECT. To be honest my entire experience there is pretty vague, but it led to my still current habit of just skimming over theories and such that people have because I didn&#039;t feel like they knew anything at all.<br />
<br />
(SKIP TO HERE IF YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO READ ANY OF THAT)<br />
<br />
My point is, I&#039;ve been with ALW since its inception and I see a lot of limiting behavior. Psychic phenomenon is by far one of the most mysterious things that we have, and guess what we as a community say about it? We say it is a tangible concept. We say it&#039;s possible! But so many people say, &quot; Well, you can&#039;t do it to that extent. &quot; Why, because you can&#039;t?<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t meant as rude, but how many of these skeptical ( I realize I&#039;m a skeptic too!) people who immediately shutdown someone&#039;s fantasy actually have tried their hardest to develop these skills? Are you still practicing and trying to get better, or have you reached a mental climax where you just say, &quot; Oh well, can&#039;t get any better. &quot; and start telling everyone else they can&#039;t too? How many of you who are making up theories have spent more time developing the skill than the theories?</div>

Lets be honest. Who arond here is willing to work his ass off in a pursuit of something that has no promised reward. Imagine spending 10...20... or 30 years in a pursuit of something, denying yourself from being distracted from your efforts, and finding out that all was for nothing. <br />

People who attend medschool KNOW that if they are willing to work the hours and walk the walk, they WILL become doctors. <br />

Psionics however gives no guarantees. You might gain something or you might not. Nobody knows and everybody wonders. People just sit in ring explaining their pipe-dream theories to one another but at the end of a the day, none is the wiser.</div>

The glass represented our lives, The sand is the fun things we can do, and the Marbles are all of the achievements we make. <br />

&quot;Won&#039;t have the time in his life to make any achievements&quot;<br />

He then poured the marbles into the jar, they rolled off the top and fell to the ground beneath his feat.<br />

*he pours the marbles into the jar, filling it up nearly to the top*<br />
<br />
&quot;Can fill his life with all the fun in the world&quot;<br />

 not a grain of sand fell from the jar, The whole High school gave him a standing ovation... It was one of the best speeches I&#039;ve heard in year ^_^.<br />

And yes, we have no idea to what end Psi will lead us. But if the British Colonists didnt TRY to gain freedom, we probably wouldnt be here. So we&#039;re like the thankless pioneers in this respect. And quite frankly, I could care less about &quot;Making something of my life&quot;. Success comes after happiness is achieved, NOT the other way around.

You get to a point where what you are talking about is so speculative that it is almost completely worthless to talk about. Not to mention it completely destroy&#039;s your credibility in the eyes of others.</div>You didn&#039;t mention how much you&#039;ve studied and tried to do any of those things though.<br />
<br />
 I understand your point, I just don&#039;t agree with it overall. It feels very silly to put limits on what we currently know as limitless. You can observer limits, but why ONLY adhere to those limits? Practitioners of Chi and martial arts (Zectra!) spend a long time developing their abilities to a tee. Maybe we just haven&#039;t tried hard enough yet.<br />

ALTHOUGH, I do agree that it can get to a point of pointlessness when all someone does is fantasize and talk about how cool it is wtihout trying to achieve it. I know, I&#039;ve been that person for a very long time.</div>

But at the same time, you can&#039;t be so open, that you entertain every wild idea with complete seriousness.  The truth is that there is only a finite amount of time, energy, and resources in the world.  So, we have to prioritize.<br />
<br />
Now, if I prioritize things differently than someone else, then that&#039;s ok.  If someone else wants to spend time and energy on trying to fly, or teleport... go for it.  I personally think there are better ways to spend your time, but it&#039;s your time.  And if you succeed, then I would definitely be interested.<br />
<br />
But what realistically happens?  A kid becomes excited, sees a movie, and thinks that if they just &quot;BELIEVE!&quot; then they can become a super-hero!  I have a hard time taking these people seriously.<br />
<br />
But sure - <strong>if</strong> that kid is successful, then by all means - bring forward your evidence!  I will be very interested in seeing it!  But that&#039;s the big if.<br />
<br />
The evidence I&#039;ve seen suggests that there are limits.  Now, I am open-minded to the point of allowing someone to show me otherwise.  But I am not open-minded to the point of ignoring all the evidence I&#039;ve seen, just so I can indulge someone in their fantasy.  I believe my approach is realistic and balanced.<br />

Not so easy is to take responsibility for what you choose to believe and how you choose to let it affect you.<br />
<br />
If someone says you can&#039;t, that doesn&#039;t mean you have to let that get you down.  Have strength, challenge their opinion if you must acknowledge it as credible, or better yet, don&#039;t acknowledge it as credible at all.  You have that choice.<br />

This forum is filled with those types of people. The world is filled with those types of people.  Those people aren&#039;t going to disappear or go away.  What are you going to do about it? Complain? Blame them? Or take control of your life?<br />
