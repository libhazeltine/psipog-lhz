More and more specific sections of the forums, hopefully a few on psionics, magick, aliens, news, etc; anything you can think of paranormal.

		<div id="post_12744" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">There&#039;s no point in making more sections if there isn&#039;t enough activity to sustain it.  I don&#039;t think there are enough posts to warrant additional sections (at this moment in time).  For example, the first 8 posts in the main forum account for 2 days worth of activity.  If there were more sections, you would still have the same amount of activity... it would just be spread out.<br />
<br />
I specifically try to avoid writing tutorials, because I feel PsiPog.net does a satisfactory job of teaching, and I don&#039;t want to attract a lot of &quot;how do I do ___?&quot; threads.  Sure, a few of these are fine, but I would like more conversation around ideas, experiences, and beliefs... not instruction.<br />

What does phpBB offer that you want to do - but can&#039;t - with the current forums?<br />

		<div id="post_12747" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Sean, can you make a banner for this site? I&#039;d use it for advertising purposes. I&#039;d really love to see more people here. I realize that it&#039;s not going to be an overnight process, to draw in a crowd. I also realize that advertising will probably draw more skeptics and trolls than anything. IF this worked, the forums would probably be overrun with a less than desirable population for some time. However, I also know that they will get bored with the chastising and whatnot, whereas those who are actually serious will stick around long after the others are gone.<br />
<br />
Whether or not this attempt seems to be pointless, I&#039;d like to try regardless. It seems a shame to me that most if not all the psi communities are all but dead. I regret missing out on the days when this stuff was in full-swing...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Made a banner. Might be cruddy though, I&#039;m no judge for my own abilities in that area. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve started advertising..I haven&#039;t been using the banner. There&#039;s a section on yahoo answers that&#039;s got people asking things on TK, trancing, etc. I&#039;ve tried answering only to people who seem sincerely interested. If they come, great. If not, well at least I tried...<br />
<br />
The number of people who dismiss this-especially in a rude manner-is astounding to me. I HAD thought about advertising in another forum, but then upon a search for related topics I came across an old thread in which I got into a huge argument with several people who believe none of this exists. Vexing, vexing...So I decided against that idea.</div>

		<div id="post_12774" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">VampiricKody, I must respectfully disagree with your ideas.<br />
<br />
1) Signatures are rather distracting, from my experience...<br />
<br />
2) What is the point of a mod? MOST of us are not immature enough to warrant the use of a moderator. If anything, only one would be needed. And it wouldn&#039;t have to be a constant thing. Just log in every once in a while and make sure there aren&#039;t morons gunking up threads and whatnot. ALSO, this forum is not even active enough for a moderator. <br />
<br />
3) I don&#039;t really think a post count is necessary.<br />
<br />
4) Why do we need profiles...? It wouldn&#039;t take off. Haven&#039;t you poked in the thread that someone asked for myspaces of other users (you may have, I forget). Nobody wanted to do it. A few did. Most said they didn&#039;t want to be known as *Random name Age Random blah blah blah blah blah&quot;. Jefferey put it excellently. *Of course I suppose some people might use the feature but...*<br />
<br />
I admire your enthusiam, and I apologize if I sounded rude.<br />
<br />
But honestly, I like the way the forums are set up now. I don&#039;t think there is any need to change it. If there ARE needs for additional features...post counts and signatures should not be at the top of the list..<br />
<br />
Which brings me to a question, and depending on how it is answered, I can ask my REAL question.<br />
<br />
Sean, I noticed that about five months back you started to become less active on the forums. I know you post at least one blog entry a month, and as you proved recently you do check in on the forums every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Is work/school(if applicable), and other things like that taking up the majority of your time? What I mean to say is, are you not as active because other circumstances make it to where you CAN&#039;T be?</div>

The reason I don&#039;t participate in the forums that much is because I don&#039;t like forums (in general).  Since the beginning of PsiPog, I&#039;ve stated my distaste for them.

<br />
The frequency of blog posts is dependent on how much paranormal stuff I do.  If I spend a month without researching or having any paranormal experiences... then I won&#039;t post anything.  A lot of my time is spent working, sleeping, eating, shopping, etc.  I had a lot more free time when I was a teenager and college student.<br />

Most people CAN&#039;T research correctly.  Most people CAN&#039;T formulate their thoughts into logical, structured articles.  ANYONE can go on a forum, and throw up all over a keyboard.  But it takes effort to produce a well thought-out article.<br />
<br />
Look, I&#039;m not saying that all the stuff I write is perfect, and everyone else sucks or anything like that.  In fact, I find a lot of the posts on ALW to be far above what I&#039;ve experienced on other forums.  And I find a lot of my blog entries to be lacking in quality.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think an article has to be bland or boring in order to be well structured.  I read engaging articles all the time, with very powerful messages, that are also well researched, and structured logically.  Yes, I&#039;ve read boring articles too, but I&#039;ve also read boring forum posts.  If anything, forum posts are more boring than articles.<br />

My time is precious.  If someone doesn&#039;t have the time to put their opinion in a well formulated, concise, engaging, researched format... then why should I take the time to read it?  I simply don&#039;t care about every little thought that crosses every person&#039;s mind.  My own thoughts are hard enough to keep up with.  I don&#039;t want to hear your thoughts; I want to hear the conclusions you&#039;ve made after 1000 hours of thinking.<br />
<br />
Everyone has an opinion, especially on the internet.  If you want your opinion to stand out over the noise, then you need to do <em>something</em> to make it stand out.  One way is to read a dozen books on the subject, and post your conclusion.  Does that take a lot of effort?  Well... yeah!  That&#039;s the point!  Do you care enough about what you&#039;re saying to actually invest your time into it?  If you don&#039;t, why should I?<br />

But you have the free decision whcich thread you want to read and/or reply to and which not. And if a discussion goes the wrong way you can still leave this thread ^^.[/quote]

In order for me to make that judgment call, I must read all threads.  So, read all threads, and determine which ones are worth following?  I would rather spend my time reading articles, where the quality is much higher.  Maybe 50% of threads I find worth my time to read, and 10% worth replying to.  Probably around 95% of the articles I read I find worth my time.

[quote]And I guess what Subliminal wanted to say is that you cant ask an article if you have a problem or if you are stuck somewhere, but the author might be able to help you, since the article holds only part of the authors knowledge. I dont say articles are useless, its the opposite, but in combination with forums their usefullness is increased (as long as the forum talks stay around the subject of the article)[/quote]
