I&#039;ll start with mine. One time when I was 12 I was out camping. It was night time, and I was observing the fire in the fire pit in front of me. I started to look at the smoke, and just to my surprise...THE BOOGY MAN CAME OUT! Just kidding, what seriously happened though is the smoke all of a sudden took into the shape of what appeared to be a full grown Indian man holding a rifle concentrating on something in the distance. It then vanished back into regular looking smoke.<br />

<br />
OBEs have had the biggest impact on me and my thoughts about reality.  One cool experience with them was talking with my subconscious (in my head, the night before), and making a deal that &quot;he&quot; would help me out.  Then, at night, I was grabbed by the wrists and ankles, and yanked out of body.  I couldn&#039;t see &quot;who&quot; did it, but I felt the hands on my wrists and ankles... and while out, I grabbed a hand and shook it, trying to say &quot;thank you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lucid dreaming, if that counts, has been fun.  I just had a lucid dream last night, where I was teaching people how to manifest objects inside of dreams.  The night before, I had a lucid dream where I was helping my uncle.<br />
<br />
Another event that had a large impact on me was the original geiger counter experiments.  After seeing the data with my own eyes, that killed my inner skeptic.  That was cool.<br />

		<div id="post_13193" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I was exhausted from a busy schoolday, sitting on my bed and just looking at the mirror next to my bed. When I found that I have been staring at it for 5 minutes already, I thought it was time to go to bed.<br />
<br />
I had a dream:<br />
There was the same mirror. Someone appeared next to it and said: &quot;You should already know that having a mirror next to your bed isn&#039;t good for you.&quot;<br />
I answered: &quot;Okay, lets cover it up then..&quot; and covered it in some kind of blue cloth.<br />
&quot;I don&#039;t actually even need that mirror there. Actually, I am the best mirror for myself..&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it felt like that someone wished to thank me for this.<br />
<br />
The dream faded out and I was drawn into the void (there was nothing around me).<br />
I started hearing some noise. The sound slowly grew louder and it was possible to feel it. At that time the sound reminded me the crunching of snow under my feet. The only difference was that I felt it in my head. The feeling grew stronger and less bearable while moving downwards from the head. It felt like my brain was boiling and my body was shaking. <br />
I then thought: &quot;What&#039;s going on with my body?&quot; and imagined myself shaking in the bed with white foam coming out of my mouth. Just in case I reoccupied my body, ran a memcheck, performed some simple calculations and verified that my limbs were still moving. Everything seemed to be working.<br />

After that incident I spent a lot of time googling those feelings. That&#039;s how I found PsiPog.</div>

OBEs have had the biggest impact on me and my thoughts about reality.  One cool experience with them was talking with my subconscious (in my head, the night before), and making a deal that &quot;he&quot; would help me out.  Then, at night, I was grabbed by the wrists and ankles, and yanked out of body.  I couldn&#039;t see &quot;who&quot; did it, but I felt the hands on my wrists and ankles... and while out, I grabbed a hand and shook it, trying to say &quot;thank you&quot;.</div>Awesome! Same thing happend to me a couple of weeks ago, though i didn&#039;t try to shake anybody&#039;s hand :D <br />
<br />
The most mind blowing experience I&#039;ve ever had was when I once had an OOBE where I traveled through some &quot;dynamic world&quot;, can&#039;t really describe what it looked like in words, which I tried to explore together with a glowing light entity.  <br />
Might sound kinda dull but it wasn&#039;t, I kid you not gentlemen I seriously shat a brick when I woke up :P</div>
