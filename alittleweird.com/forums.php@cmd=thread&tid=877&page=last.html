So instead of telling their brain that they cannot see you, you&#039;d be sending their eyes the image of what you&#039;re standing in front of.

But no, projecting the background has nothing to do with it, as you&#039;re not making yourself invisible per-say; you&#039;re making light bend and so, the person looking in your direction receives the light that went around you and which was reflected by the wall or whatever you were standing in front of.

@Sussch: Yeah I thought about the seeing problem... haven&#039;t found a work-around yet... You could make it so there&#039;s a portion of the shield that let&#039;s in light, but the others would see a face floating around... Not exactly useful. But if you can bend light this way, you could also make that chameleon shield since instead of deviating the light, you&#039;re actually making yourself absorb/reflect different colors than usual.<br />

How is telekinesis impossible?<br />
It&#039;s very possible, both theoretically and practically.</div>What I think Insectoid meant was we here at ALW and other communities know it&#039;s practically possible, but theoretically, it&#039;s breaking the laws of physics. Here are a few examples:<br />
<br />
The Inverse-Square Law<br />
The Second Law of Thermodynamics<br />
Momentum<br />
<br />
I&#039;m in a hurry so I just gave the Wikipedia examples (bad habit of mine) but you should look them up, it makes sense as to why PK would oppose them. So yes, practically, it is possible, but with our current physics system, it is theoretically impossible. But rules are meant to eb broken, right? ;)</div>

How is telekinesis impossible?
It&#039;s very possible, both theoretically and practically.[/quote]

What I think Insectoid meant was we here at ALW and other communities know it&#039;s practically possible, but theoretically, it&#039;s breaking the laws of physics. Here are a few examples:

The Inverse-Square Law
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Momentum

I&#039;m in a hurry so I just gave the Wikipedia examples (bad habit of mine) but you should look them up, it makes sense as to why PK would oppose them. So yes, practically, it is possible, but with our current physics system, it is theoretically impossible. But rules are meant to eb broken, right? ;)</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

The sight-problem is a vexing one. I was going to suggest making it so that only the visible spectrum of light passed through your body, but we can&#039;t see in infrared or ultraviolet light anyways...<br />

Ah, maybe the best idea is to just use a combination of the don&#039;t-notice-me shield and making the light pass through your body. I guess it kind of defeats the purpose to use both though...</div>
