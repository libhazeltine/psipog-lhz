My mind has been in complete chaos since the last few months, and it has started to reflect itself in my room. I have a whole bunch of boxes in my room which represent the objects in my life. My dog and his bed takes up quite a bit of space in my room. He represents my family. My dog is actually represented by a stuffed dog I have on my bed. My bed represents my dreams and nightmares. I have a small collection of jewelry which represents vanity in my life. The Icons in my room represent my spiritual life. I have my first stuffed animal sitting in an Indian baby carrier in the corner of my room, that represents my childhood. My closet represents my secrets. My windows represent the outside world and the closed curtains on them represent me shutting the world out. My bike hanging from my ceiling represents travel, and the wolves on my walls represent my personality. And since my room is really dirty and messy, it represents how messed up I am in the head right now.<br />

So, anyway. Tell what you guys think. </div>

Some would say our environments area reflection of what&#039;s going on inside of us, but at the same time we are a reflection of the environment.

I do believe that one&#039;s room reflects one&#039;s mind in more ways then one. My room is messy and small, so most of the time I have tons of chaos and I usually don&#039;t focus on it to much and explore things other than myself (to get out of that claustrophobic space).<br />

Heading back to the original topic:<br />
I would disagree on one thing with regards to my mind/my room. If my bed reflected how I dream, then one would guess that I do almost no dreaming, as I sleep on a rough cot (both because it takes up little room, and because it&#039;s crazy easy to fall asleep on). However, I dream all the time. You could, however, deduce that I am a logical/analytical person, due to the stacks of Magic: the Gathering cards and the prevalence of technology in my room (about half of my room is taken up by electronics of some sort or another, some of it partially disassembled). One would guess that I&#039;m quick to anger by the stash of weapons/ammunition in my room in open display, and the cushy loveseat, air-conditioner, and heater would give away that I like to be physically comfortable as much as possible. My closet shows my packrat nature, as it&#039;s filled with boxes from when I built my PC, which are in turn filled with PC parts (old and new-ish) that I&#039;m not using. The messy state of my room (particularly the way the clutter is arranged) indicates that I prefer convenience and utility rather than appearances (for instance, I&#039;m using an old computer case as a speaker stand for my surround sound). This also shows that I&#039;m more interested in my own happiness than the happiness of others, as I have people in my room all the time, but I almost never bother to clean up the place (everything has its place, and its place is exactly where it&#039;s at).</div>

So, I am sitting in my room, on my bed, typing. <br />
<br />
My room is a complete mess, but it has only been this way for a little while.<br />
<br />
My mind has been in complete chaos since the last few months, and it has started to reflect itself in my room. I have a whole bunch of boxes in my room which represent the objects in my life. My dog and his bed takes up quite a bit of space in my room. He represents my family. My dog is actually represented by a stuffed dog I have on my bed. My bed represents my dreams and nightmares. I have a small collection of jewelry which represents vanity in my life. The Icons in my room represent my spiritual life. I have my first stuffed animal sitting in an Indian baby carrier in the corner of my room, that represents my childhood. My closet represents my secrets. My windows represent the outside world and the closed curtains on them represent me shutting the world out. My bike hanging from my ceiling represents travel, and the wolves on my walls represent my personality. And since my room is really dirty and messy, it represents how messed up I am in the head right now.<br />
<br />
So, anyway. Tell what you guys think.</div>Well, the fact that you are making these connections means that parts of your room now reflect parts of your life. Basically, like SheepKing and Psikillion said, take control, and get your life organized.</div>

I&#039;d clean my room too, but there&#039;s really not much to be done. I mean, I could clean out behind my montior (my catch-all space for stuff I might need easy access to later, but not now), and organize all my stuff, but really, my room is <em>cluttered</em>, not <em>dirty</em>. But then again, it is a really good feeling to clean it all up, get everything organized, and then to sit down amongst the cleanliness knowing you accomplished something.</div>
