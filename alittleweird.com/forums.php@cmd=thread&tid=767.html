		<div id="post_14025" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Today I moved the psiwheel for the first time (Hurray ^o^), then tried again a few minutes later when I had calmed down and accidentally moved it with my breath (I had been breathing through my nose the whole time so it wouldn&#039;t disturb the wheel) and the paper was about to fall from the needle so I put my finger near it and as I was about to move it up on the needle, it moved back up on its own before my finger got to it.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s when it gets weird. I was too excited to keep trying, so I got up to go get a glass of water and relax. When I went back in my room and looked at the psiwheel, it started twitching lightly. The window was closed and I check the other ones on the floor, only my brothers was open and his room is next to mine, so the wind couldn&#039;t have gone to my room... So I just stared at it and it kept moving. Then I turned around, looked back and it started twitching again! When I bent down to block off any source of wind and put my hands around it, it started moving a lot more! By that I mean the twitches were bigger, as if someone was pushing it back and forth with a stick and making it rock... Do you think I unconsciously moved it around because I was in the right mindset or could it be geisting? I wasn&#039;t trying to move it or anything... Maybe my subconscious was really bored? :P</div>

Either way, simply don&#039;t use them, I am not trying to discourage you, and it is absolutely possible that you really got that wheel to move, but if you hold your hands around it, you will never be completely sure whether it is Psi or just heat coming from your hands. (For example.)<br />

Just one tip, don&#039;t put your hands around the Psiwheel!</div>Yeah, I try not to use my hands. The only times I did was when I was when I was about to put it back up and it did on its own and when I was about to pick it up and it started moving more. Other than that, I don&#039;t use them, as I read the &quot;How to NOT practice Psi&quot; :)<br />

It seems it rebels because your training your subconcious and psionic energy to do things. Some things are alive and your will is definitely a live thing. So it becomes bored and thus doesn&#039;t work right as its rebellious. It gets interested again if you reinforce your training by however you want to and relax your mind to achieve the result. The result is thought about while your mind is relaxed. Then it does the action through your subconcious. Altering reality with a caused effect and effective force, that is being applied at the time. <br />

That is my finding for now.. feel free to disagree.</div>Interesting. So right now it&#039;s a matter of controlling my mind through training, correct?<br />

Just one tip, don&#039;t put your hands around the Psiwheel!

Yeah, I try not to use my hands. The only times I did was when I was when I was about to put it back up and it did on its own and when I was about to pick it up and it started moving more. Other than that, I don&#039;t use them, as I read the &quot;How to NOT practice Psi&quot; :)

Today I moved the psiwheel for the first time (Hurray ^o^), then tried again a few minutes later when I had calmed down and accidentally moved it with my breath (I had been breathing through my nose the whole time so it wouldn&#039;t disturb the wheel) and the paper was about to fall from the needle so I put my finger near it and as I was about to move it up on the needle, it moved back up on its own before my finger got to it.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s when it gets weird. I was too excited to keep trying, so I got up to go get a glass of water and relax. When I went back in my room and looked at the psiwheel, it started twitching lightly. The window was closed and I check the other ones on the floor, only my brothers was open and his room is next to mine, so the wind couldn&#039;t have gone to my room... So I just stared at it and it kept moving. Then I turned around, looked back and it started twitching again! When I bent down to block off any source of wind and put my hands around it, it started moving a lot more! By that I mean the twitches were bigger, as if someone was pushing it back and forth with a stick and making it rock... Do you think I unconsciously moved it around because I was in the right mindset or could it be geisting? I wasn&#039;t trying to move it or anything... Maybe my subconscious was really bored? :P</div>:) this is exactly what happens to me.  I couldn&#039;t move my psi wheel with my hands even after a few days of resting and meditating so I tried to do it withought touching it and voila! a few days later I can do it :).  *also, please excuse the annoying &quot;voila!&quot; I just didn&#039;t know what else to put :P<br />
