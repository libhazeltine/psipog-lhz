		<div id="post_11672" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;m curious...anybody who has blatantly obvious psychic skills (Macro PK, advanced telepathy, spoon bending etc...how did you tell people/show people for the first time, and how did it go...I ask this, because I&#039;ve practiced psionics on and off for about 8 years now...well I couldn&#039;t do anything that was blatant enough to make people believe (those who have gotten ridiculed at psi wheel demo&#039;s by ignorant fool convinced it&#039;s &quot;the wind,&quot; will probably enjoy my story) Well I pretty much gave up on psionics years ago after being beaten down by skeptical family members...until recently, something was urging me to practice...when I was a young lad,(OK, fine, I&#039;m only 19) there were hardly any web videos available on psionics...I felt like an old man on a computer when I discovered that youtube now has hundreds of psionic tutorials and homemade vid&#039;s...well to make a long story short, a video by a girl by the name of (sagedwarf?, stagedwarf?) completely changed my life...she shows you how to magnetize your forehead and stick metal objects to it...I was convinced, despite the artards who though sticking a large chopping knife to your forehead is only a matter of balance...the video somehow removed an unconscious block that had been in me for all these years, and thanks to eight years of learning how to connect with objects...I&#039;ve achieved dramatic results in the course of about only 2 days and 12 hours of practice...here is a list of the degree to which I can magnetize my body:<br />
<br />
I can magnetize an ipod nano to my chest<br />
<br />
I can magnetize a spoon to my stomach, bowl end down...<br />
<br />
I can magnetize a video game case to my chest<br />
<br />
I can 3 stick dimes to my forehead, go into a handstand, and the dimes will not loosen there grip<br />
<br />
AND my personal favorite...nothing on this planet at all will give you the same high as sticking 25 foreign coins to your stomach, an Australian penny to your left pec, a Peruvian peso on your right pec, and a door key on your forehead!<br />
<br />
The high ended this morning when I felt more alone and alienated than ever...yes, ten years of fantasizing about having psychic powers had finally become a reality...but how do you go across telling somebody you can do stuff like this?...how do you just sit them down and show them?...there are way too many complications involved in a matter like this...so I went throughout most of the day distressed...yes, it&#039;s perfectly fine to have a unique talent, but I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s healthy to keep something like that completely to yourself...I feared that all that would come of this would be me hiding a talent to the confounds of my own room...worse, I feared that my room mate and brother would most likely grow suspicious of me, and I would have to lie to them about what was really going on...but this evening, I gathered the strength to fess up to my dad about this...honestly, without exaggerating, I was petrified to make that phone call...while I was talking to my dad, I was shaking really bad, and breathing eratically...but after I found out that he did indeed believe me, I started to calm down...I guess the main issue is that my dad doesn&#039;t want me to alienate myself...I have a habit of going on and on about the metaphysical in conversation with people at times, and I think he was afraid that I might make myself out as a pathological lair to others...so I reassured him that I would keep discussion of my talent to a minimum, and that I would be very selective in the people I show this too...we both agreed that I should probably avoid telling my brother and room mate...at least for now...<br />
<br />
well unfortunately I don&#039;t have a digital camera as of now, and I have no way of documenting my magnetism...I&#039;m hoping to get a camera phone after my next paycheck, and I would like to start posting some video&#039;s in my blog for people to watch...If I can teach even only one person what I know, then I will be satisfied...<br />
<br />
And there is one thing that I haven&#039;t told my dad...you see, I&#039;m currently a landscape student...I&#039;m very career driven, and when I start something, I finish it...My dream is to get my contracting license hopefully within the next two years...I want to own a landscaping business, own a small online nursery, (I&#039;m a horticulture nerd lol) and invest my money into real estate...<br />
...well I&#039;m starting to get a new idea...If it were last week, before I had these skills, I wouldn&#039;t have even dreamed of this: I want to start performing at the Saturday market...I don&#039;t expect to make hardly anything at first...I bet that 7 hours of performing as &quot;the human magnet&quot; would probably make maybe around a 100 dollars...but I want to take it further...I want to learn conversational hypnosis, and maybe improve my PK (which shouldn&#039;t be a problem now that the mental block is gone)...I have a really outgoing personality, and I think that if I promoted myself right, I could start going somewhere...and no, this isn&#039;t about the money at all, so don&#039;t take it the wrong way...In fact, I probably wouldn&#039;t make that much...but if I could pay the rent for my apartement while doing something that I really really enjoy...I think that is success right there...I&#039;ve made up my mind about one thing though...this summer I will perform at the Saturday market, if  at least, only once...even just as a magnet I think I could be the the next human statue (it&#039;s a Portland thing lol...there is a guy at the market who paints himself grey and stands as a statue for the entire day...he&#039;s basically a local star, and is regarded as an icon around here...you can probably find pictures of him on google)<br />
<br />
...btw, I&#039;m a writer, so I type alot...ALOT...I&#039;m known for taking two hours to post huge detailed blogs that nobody even reads...so if you&#039;ve made it this far through my thread...your either do NOT have ADD, OR your completely insane...no jk on that one...but seriously, if you&#039;ve read my entire post, I commend you...<br />
<br />
...uh...discuss?<br />

I don&#039;t think coming out of the &quot;psychic closet&quot; is always a good idea. I don&#039;t mean to scare you or anything, but some people might just want to start the salem which trails all over again. However, if you decide to make a career off of this, then everyone will just think there is some sort of trick or illusion behind it therefore you being safe.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, you are having trouble getting people to believe that you can do this sort of stuff. If that&#039;s the case, try practicing in front of your dad since he already believes you. Once you can do it comfortably in front of him, I don&#039;t see why you won&#039;t be able to do it in front of others.<br />
<br />
Also, could you maybe find the you tube videos again? This sounds very interesting, and sounds like it could be a new different sub form of psychokinesis. If not, then  I look forward to you buying a camera phone and posting your videos online.<br />
<br />
PS: I have ADD yet I still was able to read everything no problem! :P</div>

<br />
If someone you&#039;re trying to tell is too hasty and doesn&#039;t seem interested at all, then stop trying, it doesn&#039;t lead anywhere. I&#039;ve succeeded in proving something &quot;paranormal&quot; to people, and everytime it has been something that is easy to prove (with their rules). Maybe most easy thing to prove is energy/chi/ki/whatever, if someone is interested, tell him to try out ie. psiball, almost everyone does feel something at the first time but they ignore it. It may be warmth, tingling (do they spell it that way?), what ever else.<br />

Hello equinox,<br />
I don&#039;t think coming out of the &quot;psychic closet&quot; is always a good idea. I don&#039;t mean to scare you or anything, but some people might just want to start the salem which trails all over again. However, if you decide to make a career off of this, then everyone will just think there is some sort of trick or illusion behind it therefore you being safe.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, you are having trouble getting people to believe that you can do this sort of stuff. If that&#039;s the case, try practicing in front of your dad since he already believes you. Once you can do it comfortably in front of him, I don&#039;t see why you won&#039;t be able to do it in front of others.<br />
<br />
Also, could you maybe find the you tube videos again? This sounds very interesting, and sounds like it could be a new different sub form of psychokinesis. If not, then  I look forward to you buying a camera phone and posting your videos online.<br />
<br />
PS: I have ADD yet I still was able to read everything no problem! :P</div>Thanks for the reply. I can tell by my dad&#039;s voice that he believes me...it&#039;s just that when I bring up the subject, he get&#039;s very quite, and tries to change it...I&#039;m in no hurry to show him...I think he simply finds it taboo...The hard part isn&#039;t telling people...you see, when you stick things to your forehead, people are convinced you&#039;re balancing it, or it&#039;s oil that&#039;s keeping it attached...I&#039;m just afraid that the only way I can get people to believe is by sticking things to my stomach and chest...my fear, embarrassingly enough, is that If I tell someone to sit down, then I proceed to lift my shirt up, they&#039;ll be like &quot;dude, what the?&quot; then get up and leave before I can show them...that&#039;s why this is going to be a slow, methodical process...I just have to ease it in slowly with conversation and video&#039;s, and I bet that after a year, all of my friends will know and accept it as a part of me...most of my friends are social outcasts anyway, so they&#039;re the type that would stick by me even if they thought I was weird... oh, here&#039;s the video that I learned from...I started off with a door key, and took it from there... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8ppCxtcCpk...and" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8ppCxtcCpk...and</a> what you said about the illusion thing is true...I don&#039;t even have to tell people that it&#039;s real...everyone knows that Criss Angel is only an illusionist, but people are still impressed by it...When I was once at the saturday market, I saw a lady levitating a crystal ball in her hands...to this day, I don&#039;t know if it was sleight of hand or PK, but that doesn&#039;t matter, because it was cool none the less...and I&#039;m not going to jump into a career change anytime soon lol...I&#039;m going to continue my education, try performing at the Saturday market in the summer...at the very least, I can do it for fun, and on the higher spectrum, I can maybe find a way to get a small source of income throughout my schooling, or perhaps it will take me somewhere else...who knows?<br />

I&#039;ll admit I skipped through a lot of that... I think I already gleaned most of it from somewhere else (another forum, maybe?). Anyhow, the way I would come out of the &quot;psychic closet&quot; (as you put it) is by just doing the stuff around the nonbelievers without saying anything about it, and not being surprised/defensive when they don&#039;t believe you. Then when you do end up doing something, don&#039;t rub it in their faces, just carry on as if it were the most normal thing in the world. Eventually they&#039;ll see you doing all this shit and they&#039;ll be finding it hard to disbelieve. That&#039;s probably the way I&#039;ll do it, anyway. It&#039;s a good idea to keep it selective, at least for a start. Just be careful! There are some pretty unforgiving sceptics out there who won&#039;t stop bashing no matter what you do. =)</div>hi, thanks for the advice...this is kind of how I&#039;ve been planning on doing it...I&#039;m going to be posting a video on psionicsonline within the next few weeks, and if they like it, then I&#039;ll post it on my myspace...people can watch if they want, and make up their own minds...if they don&#039;t believe me, I don&#039;t get angry...I&#039;ll just use it as a motive to improve the skill...<br />

Very nice post Equinox. You have a really interesting and cool vibe. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m also very interested in seeing this &quot;magnetic body&quot; technique. The only thing I was going to say was regarding: &quot;I can 3 stick dimes to my forehead, go into a handstand, and the dimes will not loosen there grip.&quot; I do not believe that American coins can be attracted to magnets, although, in your next small paragraph you mentioned &quot;foreign coins&quot; which I am aware that many are indeed attracted to magnets. So, I&#039;m guessing those dimes were also foreign?</div>hey, thanks for the questions,<br />
<br />
first off, from what I&#039;ve read about human magnetism, they think it may be caused by electrical nerve impulses...I&#039;m not much of a science person, but from what I&#039;ve read, the electricity in peoples nerves/brains is supposed to be different from elctrostatic/ magnetic energy...the question that people should ask is not &quot;do people have electrical energy in their bodies?, but are humans physically capable of controlling it, and if so, is there even enough of it to do anything significant?&quot;...sorry lol, I&#039;m not much of a biologist, but I do know that nerves send electrical signals to the brain, and from what I know, they are not the same as magnetic or static energy...so basically, human magnets, are not in a literal sense &quot;magnets&quot;, rather they can attract various magnetic and non magnetic objects...if you watch the video, the girl explains that it can be done with plastic forks and knives...oh, about the dimes...some of them were American dimes, and some of them were Canadian dimes...they&#039;re both about the same size...although the Canadian one is a little thinner... but they seem to be made out of the same metal I think, and they both seemed to stick equally well...I have a large bag of foreign coins...I don&#039;t think they&#039;re worth much, but at least they entertain me lol...feel free to ask if you have any more questions.<br />

Don&#039;t ever give up dude...I practiced for about 8 years...I had essentially given up, and practiced maybe once every few months, just for the heck of it...until last Saturday evening I could spin a psi wheel, make non-visible psi balls, that was about it...and you should be very proud of yourself if you can do that, because you and I both know that despite what skeptics say, you are psychic, and probably none of your friends or family are...I&#039;ll tell you what...after I get my video uploaded, I will work one on one with you, and one day, very soon, anyone who has been skeptical or put you down for your hobby, will look like a fool as they watch you do something incredible!...I can actually start helping you right now, but until my video is uploaded, you may still have a subconscious block...I&#039;d focus searching youtube for psychic video&#039;s, as doing this over and over again will help remove any blocks...meditating on the subject may help also...if you can move a psi wheel, and you can remove this block, then I guarantee, that you will be able to do every single thing I have learned...drop me a message or email me at <a href="mailto:neon-eon@hotmail.com">neon-eon@hotmail.com</a>, and I can start working with you, if you&#039;d like...<br />

hi, thanks for the advice...this is kind of how I&#039;ve been planning on doing it...I&#039;m going to be posting a video on psionicsonline within the next few weeks, and if they like it, then I&#039;ll post it on my myspace...people can watch if they want, and make up their own minds...if they don&#039;t believe me, I don&#039;t get angry...I&#039;ll just use it as a motive to improve the skill...

I really hope this video can help others as much as it helped me...you have to use it as a tool to rid your mind of any doubts or blocks...after I make my video, I will go over some techniques that I developed which helped me personally...

Very nice post Equinox. You have a really interesting and cool vibe. 

I&#039;m also very interested in seeing this &quot;magnetic body&quot; technique. The only thing I was going to say was regarding: &quot;I can 3 stick dimes to my forehead, go into a handstand, and the dimes will not loosen there grip.&quot; I do not believe that American coins can be attracted to magnets, although, in your next small paragraph you mentioned &quot;foreign coins&quot; which I am aware that many are indeed attracted to magnets. So, I&#039;m guessing those dimes were also foreign?[/quote]

hey, thanks for the questions,

first off, from what I&#039;ve read about human magnetism, they think it may be caused by electrical nerve impulses...I&#039;m not much of a science person, but from what I&#039;ve read, the electricity in peoples nerves/brains is supposed to be different from elctrostatic/ magnetic energy...the question that people should ask is not &quot;do people have electrical energy in their bodies?, but are humans physically capable of controlling it, and if so, is there even enough of it to do anything significant?&quot;...sorry lol, I&#039;m not much of a biologist, but I do know that nerves send electrical signals to the brain, and from what I know, they are not the same as magnetic or static energy...so basically, human magnets, are not in a literal sense &quot;magnets&quot;, rather they can attract various magnetic and non magnetic objects...if you watch the video, the girl explains that it can be done with plastic forks and knives...oh, about the dimes...some of them were American dimes, and some of them were Canadian dimes...they&#039;re both about the same size...although the Canadian one is a little thinner... but they seem to be made out of the same metal I think, and they both seemed to stick equally well...I have a large bag of foreign coins...I don&#039;t think they&#039;re worth much, but at least they entertain me lol...feel free to ask if you have any more questions.

Aww, you&#039;re supposed to ask him that BEFORE you give the explanation. Now the answer is less important. = (

ah! double negatives...I&#039;m confused...I keep reading that sentence, and I feel stupider then the time I spent 10 minutes staring into a car window trying to figure out what &quot;objects in mirror may be closer than they are appear.&quot; meant...&quot;are they close?...or do they appear close, but they&#039;re actually far away?...or do they look far away in the mirror???? lmao...ahhh...

Hey I feel the same, except I still can&#039;t do anything significant, I hate myself for that, but I know I can&#039;t accomplish everything in life so it&#039;s okay. But psionics is very important, so I hate my self for being an idiot, and for feeling like an idiot. What I need to do is get myself together and start heading my own life, easy to say...Everyone can hate me for being the way I am ,incapable of doing things which I am capable of to help my team, my friends, I can blame myself for it, but that&#039;s the way, for some people it is not so easy to control yourself that much, it is my incapability, and I must conquer it, and I am working on it. =p[/quote]er

Don&#039;t ever give up dude...I practiced for about 8 years...I had essentially given up, and practiced maybe once every few months, just for the heck of it...until last Saturday evening I could spin a psi wheel, make non-visible psi balls, that was about it...and you should be very proud of yourself if you can do that, because you and I both know that despite what skeptics say, you are psychic, and probably none of your friends or family are...I&#039;ll tell you what...after I get my video uploaded, I will work one on one with you, and one day, very soon, anyone who has been skeptical or put you down for your hobby, will look like a fool as they watch you do something incredible!...I can actually start helping you right now, but until my video is uploaded, you may still have a subconscious block...I&#039;d focus searching youtube for psychic video&#039;s, as doing this over and over again will help remove any blocks...meditating on the subject may help also...if you can move a psi wheel, and you can remove this block, then I guarantee, that you will be able to do every single thing I have learned...drop me a message or email me at neon-eon@hotmail.com, and I can start working with you, if you&#039;d like...

-good luck, and DO NOT GIVE UP!

A couple years ago, I showed a friend some telepathy. That person was interested for a little while, but then they forgot about it. Eventually that person even began to disbelieve in that even being possible. So I figured, &quot;why even bother if they just forget?&quot;, I keep most things to myself anyway.

If people express interest long enough, then sure, I&#039;ll show them.

But if its just &quot;the next new thing&quot; for them, then I don&#039;t see a point in wasting time.[/quote]

I&#039;ve found that non-psychics tend to behave in this manner...I always thought it strange...for example, if I do something incredibly embarrassing, my friends will make fun of me, or embarrass me for a few day&#039;s then they will completely forget about it, and never bring it up again...I can sometimes almost manipulate my friends into forgetting about it...try this next time your friends are giving you a hard time about something...throughout the day, tell your friends about random things, that are completely opposite of embarrassing...bring up intellectual conversations...point out random things that you notice, that do not pertain to the reason they were making fun of you...if they&#039;re talking to you, and they start using words similar to your event, start pointing out random things to change the subject...Of course, friends are supposed to give you a hard time now and then...but I&#039;ve found that you can manipulate people to stop thinking about something, until they completely forget...this is actually a very basic level of conversational hypnosis...I believe that psychics are much more immune to mental manipulation, because if something funny happens to one of my friends...I never forget lol...


ahhh...it&#039;s 1:30 and I have work tomorrow...

		<div id="post_11697" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">IMO, non-psionics are skeptical because they don&#039;t experience psionics themselves, and the hardcore skeptics will never believe in psionics, perhaps because they are more used to the &quot;conventional&quot; science that govern the world today. Things that are tangible are often easier to believe than things that are not, agree? Like what the others said, it&#039;ll be good if you can prove it to others that psionics is true, but then there will be those hardcore skeptics who would decide that psionics are just illusionary or non-existent. Just look at people like James Randi.<br />

@equinox<br />
Your skill is quite cool. Are you able to attract things with your palms as well? If you can then you could wield objects easily without fearing that the objects would drop. If you learn martial arts too, and can hold your weapons and handle them without having to grip them, now that is something worth watching. Just a suggestion here.</div>

<br />
...first off, sorry about my comment, I didn&#039;t mean to come off as a jerk if it sounded that way...I have a really bad habit of wording things the wrong way sometimes...I was actually trying to make fun of myself, as I feel kind of embarrassed about how I get confused really easily over stuff that almost anyone can understand...I tend to make fun of myself so that others can&#039;t...it&#039;s kind of a defense mechanism, but it sometimes comes off the wrong way...<br />
<br />
...are we cool? :)<br />
<br />
now about the video:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit myself, that her techniques seemed a tad ehhh &quot;on the fluffy side&quot;...and it was kind of comical that it took her a a million tries to put out the candal (I had watched that a few days ago) ...now I personally believe that her techniques were aided somewhat by oil and balance...and, I will admit, that they could have possibly been completely non-psychic related...so why did I post it?...let me explain...after watching her video a few times, I started using my own technique...when I magnetized myself now, I do not tap my stomach...I naturally transitioned into using a technique that felt natural to me...I was able to use this technique to implement larger objects onto other area&#039;s of my body, hence why I brought up the shirtless factor...When I posted this on tuesday, I was aware that there was a great deal of skepticism about the forehead...Sunday night was the night when I had success sticking objects to my torso and chest...that is why my post on psionicsonline is dated around 7:00 in the morning the next day...I had first watched the video Saturday, stuck a door key to my forehead, and completely believed it was psychic phenomenon...so Sunday night, after reading more of the skeptical comments on Youtube, I was determined to do something better, that could not be proven with science...having what I felt to be success, I joined psionicsonline, and offered to share a video...At this time, all of my feats which I felt worthy involved my stomach or chest...Monday, after waking up late in the afternoon...oh, forget, it, I&#039;m confusing my self trying to backtrack lol, and this is beyond the point (see, what I mean?)...well anyway, healthy skepticism is appreciated, as it will help me train harder...when I show the video, you can make up your own mind... <br />
<br />
A quick update...<br />
<br />
I just PM&#039;d the admin of psionicsonline, (I&#039;ve been posting there as well, as I think one of you mentioned) anyway, I&#039;m going to be sending him some footage Monday, and if the staff like it, they may put it up...<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, that I&#039;ve been busting my gut trying to keep up full communication on two sites as well as trying to reply to everyone, and I&#039;ve been taking this time out of my sleeping time, as well as my practice time...anyway, I probably should have been asleep an hour ago, but I need to practice for about an hours as well...There are still some people that I haven&#039;t replied to yet, and I promise that I will respond to everyone eventually<br />
<br />
here is a list of things that I&#039;ve learned since:<br />
<br />
magnetizing dimes to the back of my hand, WHILE it is completley vertical...<br />
<br />
I moved from magnetizing the ipod from my chest, to my stomach<br />
<br />
While playing around with some coins in my hands for a few minutes, I noticed that I was beginning to learn how to magnetize them to my palms, while I held my hands vertically<br />
<br />
I can magnetize dimes to my forearm<br />
<br />
I will get back to everyone on Sunday...I&#039;m not getting enough sleep, and hence, I&#039;m starting to loose track of time and not have the slightest clue what I&#039;m talking about...<br />
<br />
-please be patient (again I will have the footage on Monday)<br />

Hey Cinderwild,

...first off, sorry about my comment, I didn&#039;t mean to come off as a jerk if it sounded that way...I have a really bad habit of wording things the wrong way sometimes...I was actually trying to make fun of myself, as I feel kind of embarrassed about how I get confused really easily over stuff that almost anyone can understand...I tend to make fun of myself so that others can&#039;t...it&#039;s kind of a defense mechanism, but it sometimes comes off the wrong way...

...are we cool? :)

now about the video:

I&#039;ll admit myself, that her techniques seemed a tad ehhh &quot;on the fluffy side&quot;...and it was kind of comical that it took her a a million tries to put out the candal (I had watched that a few days ago) ...now I personally believe that her techniques were aided somewhat by oil and balance...and, I will admit, that they could have possibly been completely non-psychic related...so why did I post it?...let me explain...after watching her video a few times, I started using my own technique...when I magnetized myself now, I do not tap my stomach...I naturally transitioned into using a technique that felt natural to me...I was able to use this technique to implement larger objects onto other area&#039;s of my body, hence why I brought up the shirtless factor...When I posted this on tuesday, I was aware that there was a great deal of skepticism about the forehead...Sunday night was the night when I had success sticking objects to my torso and chest...that is why my post on psionicsonline is dated around 7:00 in the morning the next day...I had first watched the video Saturday, stuck a door key to my forehead, and completely believed it was psychic phenomenon...so Sunday night, after reading more of the skeptical comments on Youtube, I was determined to do something better, that could not be proven with science...having what I felt to be success, I joined psionicsonline, and offered to share a video...At this time, all of my feats which I felt worthy involved my stomach or chest...Monday, after waking up late in the afternoon...oh, forget, it, I&#039;m confusing my self trying to backtrack lol, and this is beyond the point (see, what I mean?)...well anyway, healthy skepticism is appreciated, as it will help me train harder...when I show the video, you can make up your own mind... 

A quick update...

I just PM&#039;d the admin of psionicsonline, (I&#039;ve been posting there as well, as I think one of you mentioned) anyway, I&#039;m going to be sending him some footage Monday, and if the staff like it, they may put it up...

Please keep in mind, that I&#039;ve been busting my gut trying to keep up full communication on two sites as well as trying to reply to everyone, and I&#039;ve been taking this time out of my sleeping time, as well as my practice time...anyway, I probably should have been asleep an hour ago, but I need to practice for about an hours as well...There are still some people that I haven&#039;t replied to yet, and I promise that I will respond to everyone eventually

here is a list of things that I&#039;ve learned since:

magnetizing dimes to the back of my hand, WHILE it is completley vertical...

I moved from magnetizing the ipod from my chest, to my stomach

While playing around with some coins in my hands for a few minutes, I noticed that I was beginning to learn how to magnetize them to my palms, while I held my hands vertically

I can magnetize dimes to my forearm

I will get back to everyone on Sunday...I&#039;m not getting enough sleep, and hence, I&#039;m starting to loose track of time and not have the slightest clue what I&#039;m talking about...

-please be patient (again I will have the footage on Monday)
