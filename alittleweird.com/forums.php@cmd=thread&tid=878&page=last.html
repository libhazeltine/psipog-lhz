<br />
The thing is, there has to obviously be some element that enables psi to take place. I am convinced it is dimethyltryptamine since it is the most potent hallucinogenic in the world and is found naturally in the pineal body and the spinal fluid. Now then, what is a kundalini awakening? That&#039;s right, the spine and the &quot;third eye&quot;. <br />
<br />
Toddler&#039;s brainwaves are in the theta state (4hz-7hz per second), and many of them can do remote viewing without knowing there is any such thing - Ingo Swann tells us that RV must take place at the theta brainwave state. Get the picture?<br />
<br />
There is, without question, some scientific way one can examine and utilize psi itself as of which. I did a report on DMT being connected to psi activity through the research of Dr Roney-Dougal years ago. Now even if DMT wasn&#039;t how psi begins, something else certainly is responsible for it. Electrical activity seems to be present in the people with poltergeist activity surrounding them. And, of course, some people whom have received a near-fatal electric shock have had strange movements of objects around them from time to time.<br />
<br />
Some people are born with this core of psi activity where the intensity is obviously higher and thus do psi without even knowing it has a name. The ones who &quot;learn&quot; it, I&#039;m convinced, are controlling whatever strength the &quot;psi core&quot;, we&#039;ll call it, has. Others don&#039;t have such strength because not enough of the psi source&#039;s energy has been &quot;charged&quot; like a few people in the world have. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s what I think it all comes down to. Very few people have so much &quot;psi core&quot; charge that they can move chairs, but many people have just barely enough to move a paperclip one millimeter forward if they really make concerted efforts to do so. My goal is to find out what this &quot;psi core&quot; is and how it is charged/discharged using science.  <br />

That is of course, if the charging process involves anything other than a deadly electric shock :P.

You guys are some of the troopers working on the new community aren&#039;t you? Except for the praise, my post doesn&#039;t really apply to you guys. Kube even in your post you didn&#039;t say &quot;dead&quot;, you said &quot;dying&quot;, which implies more hope than does &quot;dead&quot;, right?  Really, without mentioning any names, I was talking about those who seemed to be promoting the idea that psionics is &quot;dead&quot;.  There were only a few posts that seemed to convey that, however those were the posts I was referring to.<br />
<br />
Kube buddy, you&#039;re a smart one and I respect you, which is why I hope what I&#039;m about to address is a misunderstanding: <br />

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;"><em>posted by savemydonkey:</em><br />
...that discouragement will spread into the minds of newcomers, who we shouldn&#039;t turn away with pessimism...</div>then I would have to wholeheartedly disagree.  I definitely wouldn&#039;t call declaring the death of a living idea, in itself, &quot;ambitious&quot;.  You troopers may have had an ambitious reaction, however the pessimism I was referring to was the idea that psionics is dead.  <br />
<br />
Now if those same newcomers came in and read &quot;Psionics is declining&quot;, don&#039;t you think it would have a different effect on them than &quot;Psionics is dead&quot;? I would definitely think so, and furthermore I consider the latter to be pessismistic or cognitively simplistic.  <br />
<br />
Let me also emphasize that my statement about the thread dying was an attempted pun on its title, not a resolution to remove the thread from the forum, which is obviously ridiculous.  I am often reminded that my sense of humor is a little aloof :/ but rest assured, it is not serious.  I&#039;ll go ahead and EDIT the post to avoid future confusion.  <br />

<br />
I&#039;m sorry if anyone feels like psioncs is dead, or that the psionic community as a whole is dead.  Realisitcaly, psionics isn&#039;t dead and probably never will be and I would ask those who think that to open up their scope.<br />
<br />
Hasn&#039;t psionics been around for ages - even before it was called &quot;psionics&quot;? Isn&#039;t its practice age old and comes in numerous different forms? Just because it&#039;s difficult to find a website on the internet that practices psionics in the way Psipog did doesn&#039;t mean its &quot;dead&quot; - let alone that the psionic community does not just reside in various forums on the internet.  <br />
<br />
In my 7 years of practice, I have seen numerous psionic and metaphysical communities rise and fall, but a new one always emerges and the ideology itself never dies and probably never will - unless they can find a way to disprove metaphysics in its entirety, beyond a doubt (joke).  <br />

You can be positive and realistic at the same time :)</div>

		<div id="post_16261" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">@savemydonkey: And a misunderstanding it was... That&#039;s just me replying to posts without thinking abut who they were intended for, sorry. XD You&#039;re right; psionics isn&#039;t dead and most likely never will be, but it&#039;s in bad shape. The analogy with the cancerous child works well here: Even though you can&#039;t say he&#039;s doing great, you still can&#039;t say he&#039;s already dead and that there&#039;s no hope.<br />
<br />
What I meant by &quot;psionics&quot; when I said it&#039;s not doing well, I was mostly referring to the whole psionic community. Of course, psionics will always be around and have always been, but it wasn&#039;t always such an open topic. Now, we&#039;ve got people researching it and experimenting with it in every situation imaginable and helping each other out to understand something that&#039;s been filled with questions for its entire history. If the psionic community dies out, the chance to actually advance dies with it. Sure, maybe a few years later, or a decade, two, maybe over a hundred years, someone will do it all over again. But as much as I trust our friends at the Immortality Institute, I&#039;d rather not wait another hundred years before that happens. The psionic community&#039;s not dead, but it sure is broken. If we keep going in the right direction, we can fix it.<br />
<br />
By the way, what I meant by &quot;ambitious&quot; was that even though we&#039;ve got the realistic point of view and the whole idea that psionics isn&#039;t doing good right now, we&#039;re still working on it. As you can see, I&#039;m pretty confident we can work this out.<br />
<br />
Oh and, yeah, me and f3licks are some of those working on the project. Let&#039;s not forget, though, there are a lot more. Dash, Trick and Paranoid Jester, just to name a few.</div>
