Do you want to confirm it?<br />
Do you want to realize the full potential of the ability and start changing the world for the better?(like the death note guy, kill all the bad guys--bad is subjective here, I am bad)<br />
<br />
But, I don&#039;t believe a word you said sorry. Why don&#039;t you test your theory, why don&#039;t you test it on me since I don&#039;t believe a word you said ---so I don&#039;t really mind even if you can do it, though I know it would never be true.<br />
<br />
yes I am skeptical with this, I don&#039;t care, and I know I am not messing with my life here, this is not my real name so if you do kill me no one will find out, just to assure you.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t see me posting anything for a week then I&#039;m gone, I&#039;m pretty sure people will be convinced. But if I do live, it proves me to be correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don&#039;t you just ask death to do it? Because you can&#039;t? Or because you need to &quot;know&quot; a couple of things before you can kill someone? Are you ganna make up those things because you really can&#039;t do it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Or, you can just say i have nothing to do with me, so there&#039;s no reason to. Well, does a reason really matter in this case? You CAN&#039;T do it...that&#039;s my conclusion, maybe I am skeptical about this stuff, but right now I&#039;m 100% sure for some reason...maybe it&#039;s not me talking anymore. <br />
<br />
<br />
But to prove it just to me, you have to do something =p<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry for the lines of distrust, it just doesn&#039;t feel like myself =p<br />
on second thought you don&#039;t have to take anything into your consideration at all, it is NOT that I am taking back my words, I still don&#039;t believe you, but if you think I&#039;m nonsense or just someone who is crazy, ignore it. I swear I don&#039;t want you to, but it&#039;s really all up to you, since you are the boss of yourself. <br />
<br />
And NO, nothing will happen to me because I don&#039;t believe in the power to talk to death, maybe that can happen but I can somehow assure that it is not death, how do you know it&#039;s death? It can be some other lost soul, or something unknown. And no, we don&#039;t die without a consequence, this post will not be a consequence I can assure you that. Nothing will happen. Death can not kill a specified person, that&#039;s what I know for SURE...<br />

PS: by specified person I mean just anyone you want to kill =p</div>
