		<div id="post_16052" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The other day at school in psychology class we had the opportunity to be hypnotized via a speaker on a cassette tape. I decided to go ahead and try it, as did the rest of the class.<br />
<br />
It was amazing. I don&#039;t even think I can explain what it was like. We started out by sitting or lying down on the floor, and the tape walked us through the procedures of relaxing ourselves until he began telling us what to do. He pretty much just gave us several scenarios in which we had to fill in missing details with our imaginations, but the <em>imagery</em> - it was incredible! I could literally feel everything he was saying and could clearly see everything in my mind&#039;s eye.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think this could be a really good tool for helping some people realize their psychic potential, because of the relaxed state of mind and the power suggestion has on you. Basically, you can focus the entirety of your attention on a single thing or task, which would help a lot of people. Any thoughts? <br />
<br />
Has anyone else ever been hypnotized? For anyone who doesn&#039;t know much about it, I suggest they skim over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis" target="_blank" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis">this</a>, since hypnosis has become one of those things hyped up to the point you don&#039;t know what to believe.</div>

		<div id="post_16054" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">A friend of my mother&#039;s went to a very expensive hypnotist to experiment with hypnotism and recall any possible repressed memories she had.  During the session, she recalled her father molesting her and so after the session, highly agitated, she confronted him about it.  However, he told her it had never happened.  When she explained the situational context in which it had occured, her father and mother both were able to account for it not even being possible, due to the father being at work.  When this evidence was shown to her, she confirmed that her father was indeed at work and that it was indeed impossible, however even though she could confirm such things logically, the &quot;memory&quot; which she had formed while under hypnosis was so vivid that she struggled to emotionally be the same with her father - she couldn&#039;t even hug him anymore because when she did, she thought about the fake memory of her father molesting her.  <br />
<br />
Hypnosis is a very powerful, very dangerous thing guys.  You&#039;re going to want to be careful when playing with it.  <br />
<br />
(It should be noted that this is only one situation; hypnotism happens all the time safely without these kinds of results.  In fact, there is a hypnotism program to help people stop smoking that actually works; my friend used it and hasn&#039;t had even the desire to smoke a cirgarette since.  Just be careful when you play with it!)</div>

<br />
In the situation you described, this could have only really happened if the person thought the situation up on her own (barring the possibility of it being true, which it obviously isn&#039;t) There were probably several psychological factors involved in the falsification of memories, but in any case, it could not have been the hypnotist&#039;s fault either. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not really as dangerous as you&#039;re saying, though. Even though you are very open to suggestion during hypnosis, you still have plenty of self-control. The effects are only as strong as you let them be - this is why hypnosis is effective for smokers who really do want to quit (though this may also invoke the placebo effect to some extent). Anyways, you still retain your consciousness and self-awareness when you&#039;re hypnotized, you just don&#039;t pay as much attention to them.</div>

I must also second your statement &quot;[h]ypnotism really relies on the person being hypnotized,&quot; because I completely agree, however I would also agree that this is where the danger lies, wouldn&#039;t it?  It is similar to the way a scary movie has different effects on people; take &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; for example. Everyone walks into that movie knowing just what it is: a movie.  Some of those people can get into the movie and become really scared; in some cases, so much so that they might not be able to sleep soundly for days.  Others, however, might not be as scared during or after the movie, and still others might not even have been able to get into the movie enough to get scared at all.  <br />
     However, you are right about hypnotism, and applying it to this situation, we all walk into the movie with our previously acquired psychological traits and mindsets, and we all have the potential (for the most part) not to get scared of the movie, just as before a hypnotism session we have the potential to have full self-control.  At the same time though, we know there will be people that will be scared despite their ability not to get scared, be it that they come into the movie wanting to get scared, or just because they were forced to.  The main point I want to bring up from that example is that although almost everyone has the self-control potential, not everyone realizes it, right? <br />
Being that anyone could come upon the information in this forum, although I&#039;m not trying to be adversarial to anything you&#039;re saying, and I&#039;m most certainly not trying to say hypnotism as a whole is unsafe, I just want to make sure that our happy readers are informed :)<br />
