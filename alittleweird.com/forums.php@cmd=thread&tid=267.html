It is made up of 2 different sounds, each put in different ear on headphones. For example, you use something with like 315 Hz in the left ear and 325 Hz, the brain is entrained towards the beat frequency (10 Hz).<br />
<br />
There are many free programs which use BB&#039;s for their own reason.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.i-doser.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.i-doser.com">I-Doser</a>: A BB program used to simulate the effect of drugs and others. The site has a store which you, for a small fee, purchase &#039;doses&#039; from (Which I own, along with most of the doses.).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://uazu.net/sbagen/" target="_blank" title="http://uazu.net/sbagen/">SBaGen</a>: A BB generator.<br />
<br />
Some of the main BB&#039;s that are featured are the normal brain waves, which include:<br />
<br />
Gamma waves - Higher mental activity, including perception, problem solving, fear, and consciousness<br />
Beta waves - Active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration, arousal, cognition<br />
Alpha waves - Relaxation (while awake), pre-sleep and pre-wake drowsiness<br />
Theta waves - Dreams, deep meditation, REM sleep<br />
Delta waves - Deep dreamless sleep, loss of body awareness<br />
<br />
Now, the one we&#039;re gonna be centered around, and which I believe all paranormal happenings center around, is Theta.<br />
<br />
So, I&#039;ve been doing some research, well, A LOT of research. I plan on making a post of my findings, you may benefit from them. And so far, many weird things, such as TK and others of the sort, center around Theta. One of the things I&#039;ve discovered is that children from 5-8 spend most of their time in Theta... And I <em>know</em> you&#039;ve seen those videos of children with TK. :-) Theta is also found in adults as well.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, lemme get to my point. Me and my friend have always been into things paranormal (She&#039;s 17 and I&#039;m 15.). We would explain our theories and such like that. Now, I&#039;m a person who has much difficulty with most of this stuff. I told her about PsiPog and ALW and she might even read this post as well. (:-P) But, as I was saying, we would practice TK daily. I didn&#039;t make much progress on it. I&#039;m not really that good, I don&#039;t know why... Hell ,I can barely make a decent psi-ball. :-/ But she, she was making the psi-wheel twitch. So, I told her about BB&#039;s and gave her I-Doser and one of the doses that come with it which enduces theta. She listened to it, and her TK ability has increased dramatically after she listened to it. I believe it made her brain more familiar with theta and it makes it easier for her brain to move to theta. She was first twitching psi-wheels, and now she can throw forks! I was amazed at this, and when I tried the theta, it worked for me as well. You could&#039;ve guessed how overjoyed I was. :-P <br />
<br />
<br />
And also, she has been working on OBE&#039;s as well. Me, I&#039;ve also been trying out OBE&#039;s as well, but I can&#039;t remember my dreams alot and I&#039;m working on the dream journal first. So, I&#039;ve been looking up all the OBE methods and come down to a conclusion:<br />
<br />
How to OBE<br />
<br />
1. Put your body to &#039;sleep&#039;.<br />
2. Get into a trance.<br />
3. Your body &quot;spits you out&quot;.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much the general idea. So, on the I-Doser site/SBaGen, there are doses that numb your body (Pretty much step 1.). So, I gave her one of them, and she used it before going to sleep. After days after nothing, guess what? She had an OBE. It was very exciting to know most of the theories I&#039;ve come to are true.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, main points:<br />
<br />
- I believe the brainwave theta is connected to subconscience/conscience communication.<br />
<br />
- My OBE general idea is somewhat correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what do you guys think after reading all of that? Think I&#039;m correct or just some weird 15-year old? :-P</div>

Also, what was the atmosphere like when you did it (noises, lighting, location)? Were you lying down in a bed? Sitting in a chair? What distance can your friend &quot;throw&quot; the forks?

<br />
1. The dose for theta was... Theta. :-P I could send it to you if you want. The dose for the OBE, I don&#039;t remember. But, I know they do have a certain dose for OBE CALLED OBE....<br />
<br />
2. There are no people immune to BB&#039;s. I&#039;ve looked it up. It just takes awhile for your brain to go &quot;........OH! OKAY!&quot;. It took me awhile as well.<br />
<br />
3. Atmosphere? Best kind is usually lying down in bed with your eyes closed in the dark, no distractions. But, it could be done in any as long as you can concentrate on the BB&#039;s.<br />
<br />
4. Well, I&#039;ve never seen her throw the fork cause she was really mad (Long, personal story of hers which I don&#039;t wanna say in public.). And it was across a kitchen table. But, she can also roll pencils.<br />
<br />
5. Well, her? I&#039;m not sure. Maybe RIGHT when it was finished. But, I tried it when it was playing, and it barely moved. But, I believe that was cause I wasn&#039;t paying attention to the BB. But, AS SOON as I was done, I tried it, and it worked. :-)  The effect&#039;s of most BB&#039;s last 5 minutes after it stopped.<br />
<br />
5. Side effects? Nah, not really. But, if you listen to the BBs on loud, you WILL get a headache.<br />
<br />
6. Put &#039;Jeffrey Awesome! was here.&#039; in your journal for me. :-P<br />
<br />
But, yeah, I wish you the best of luck, and if you, or anyone reading this right now wants any of the doses, I have them <em>all</em> and I&#039;m willing to share. :-)</div>

2. There are no people immune to BB&#039;s. I&#039;ve looked it up. It just takes awhile for your brain to go &quot;........OH! OKAY!&quot;. It took me awhile as well.

3. Atmosphere? Best kind is usually lying down in bed with your eyes closed in the dark, no distractions. But, it could be done in any as long as you can concentrate on the BB&#039;s.

4. Well, I&#039;ve never seen her throw the fork cause she was really mad (Long, personal story of hers which I don&#039;t wanna say in public.). And it was across a kitchen table. But, she can also roll pencils.

5. Well, her? I&#039;m not sure. Maybe RIGHT when it was finished. But, I tried it when it was playing, and it barely moved. But, I believe that was cause I wasn&#039;t paying attention to the BB. But, AS SOON as I was done, I tried it, and it worked. :-)  The effect&#039;s of most BB&#039;s last 5 minutes after it stopped.

5. Side effects? Nah, not really. But, if you listen to the BBs on loud, you WILL get a headache.

6. Put &#039;Jeffrey Awesome! was here.&#039; in your journal for me. :-P

But, yeah, I wish you the best of luck, and if you, or anyone reading this right now wants any of the doses, I have them [i]all[/i] and I&#039;m willing to share. :-)</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
