Second I want you to think about these experiences very carefully, because they are really complicated (I think, for the lack of a better word).<br />
<br />
A few days ago I had one of those shocking moments that my life needs more control or else my life will be terrible in the future. However this is not what I wanted you to think about (because that is a personal experience), but what happened after it.<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">I went to bed very upset, and was wondering how the heck I will be able to pull all of that off. I felt helpless and did not know what to do. Then what happened was I felt like someone was mentally placing their arm around my shoulders (all of that was mental, not involving any physical things at all). My guess at the time was that it was God reminding me that he was there (which I have not been able to disprove). Then I decided the best way to handle my situation is to allow God to completely control it, because it was pretty obvious that I (as my own person) cannot do it. Then I felt as if I was mentally shaking someone&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
When that was over I suddenly had this really weird dream. I died in such a horrific way that I was completely destroyed. My family decided to bury me (though how they buried me, I have no clue). Near my tombstone and in the ground I was buried in were the most beautiful flowers ever (for the lack of better words, or at least that is what came into my mind when I was dreaming). These flowers were made out of pure silver that one can see their own reflections in it. Also these flowers are in a shape that makes it look like these flowers are fire. A person went up to my grave and looked at one of these flowers. It seemed like he completely changed and became more cheerful when he was looking at this flower, and decided to take it and leave.</div>First I would like to mention about my experiences in receiving telepathy in order to clarify my first experience for you:<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">1. July 2008 One of my friends and I played this telepathy game which was like the colors and shapes game, except it was objects at the table. I managed to get it right once, but unfortunately after then he did not have the time to practice with me (work).<br />
<br />
2. August 2008 I did the telepathy game (the colors and shapes) with wolfdancer on Psionline and I was usually off in either the shapes or the colors category.<br />
<br />
3. September 2008 to present I decided in order to become more skilled in telepathy I need to make a telepathical beacon to pick up the signals in telepathy and other people&#039;s thoughts.<br />
<br />
4. I have no shields unless my subconscious has certain defenses already made.<br />
<br />
5. When I do receive something in telepathy it takes a while and does not seem to come out as clear. However, this experience was instantaneous and extremely clear.</div>For the dream I translated as such (even though I probably will forget to translate a few of the details):<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">My physical and spiritual life will completely change (utter destruction). This change would effect me forever (buried). This change will bear fruit which will affect others (the flowers). This fruit will make others look introspectively at their own lives (the silver and the man looking at the flowers). These people will change similar to what will happen for me (the fire shape of the flowers and man completely changed). These people would be changed for the better (the cheerful part). Others I have not seen would hear the story of how I completely changed through others (man walking away with flower).</div>I am of course open to any suggestions, and I would like to thank you in advance for any help you might give. ;D</div>

I&#039;ve had a somewhat similiar experience once that invloved me feeling much like you did, about life and fear about the future. I went to bed upset as well(very upset) and out of nowhere, this amazing image was displayed in the forefront of my mind (not in my mind, but much like a psychotropic hullucination, in front of the mind. It was warm and brilliant and there was this intense feeling of &quot;someone&quot; or something looking out for me. I won&#039;t say it&#039;s god, but I can see where you are coming from. <br />
I also had a dream that night after my experience, but I do not recall it at all. I do remember the experience very well though and I still wonder what it means. I think the empasis should be placed more on the &quot;arm around shoulder&quot; experience you had moreso than the dream, only because it seems to have been a very mysterious and interesting experience. I see dreams as mostly our own answers to questions or problems in our lives our conscious minds are unable to answer, unless it&#039;s lucid of course, then we make them.   </div>
