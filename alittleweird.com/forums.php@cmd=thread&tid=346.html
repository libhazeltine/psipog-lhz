Well,what is time then? theoretically, if any type of link between times was possible, would it then also be possible to take energy from a physical event in time, and harness psi-energy, or even normal energy from that event?<br />
<br />
for example, If a rock was falling in 20 B.C off a cliff in present day Ireland, would it be theoretically possible to harness energy from that rock falling to make something move where you live in the here and now?<br />
<br />
moreover, what would be the repricussions of doing such a thing, and, for further inquiry, what would our lives ten look like because of it?<br />
<br />
Would it even be possible to corrupt an Experiment, and therefore our own concept of science because of it? If it was, what kind of effect would it have, would it be corrected? Could there have been someone who got a false test result that changed our concept of reality that was then fixed later on in time that we don&#039;t know about because we didwhat we did?<br />

These are questions I ask myself on a day to day basis? What would your answer be to these?</div>

<br />
However, I do see where you are going.  Don&#039;t think of time as being an energy, rather, think of the &quot;velocity&quot; of time as HAVING energy.  According to science, there only exists one &quot;moment&quot; of time.  One &quot;frame&quot; if you will.  Physically, current theories suggest that quantized time is:  1.8755459 × 10^−18 C   or  about 5.4 × 10^−44 seconds.<br />
<br />
The past is done, the future hasn&#039;t happened yet.  <br />
<br />
However the energy of the past exists as energy that, many say were started by the Big Bang, continue to &quot;push&quot; time forward.<br />
<br />
Now that&#039;s physical time.  When time as a constant changes, everything relying on it does as well.  Time on a mental level is more elastic.  Not being constrained by the energy of physicality, the mind can work ahead or behind to manipulate information.  Using this, we can use the &quot;velocity&quot; or &quot;stress&quot; of the time-domain to perpetuate our own changes.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s how the theory goes at least.<br />
<br />
Obviously, more experimentation is needed.  ^__^</div>

Even if one could draw energy from the past, a paradox would likely be created.

It hasn&#039;t happened until it happens.  Note I said &quot;Now that&#039;s physical time...Time on a mental level is more elastic&quot;<br />
<br />
You see, physicality is a one frame game.  But fanning out from the present is a multitude of lines of probability.  What has occurred in the past will describe the possible states of the future.  Just like we can use spatial-temporal reasoning to do problem solving everyday, supposedly, we can extrapolate possible future events and scenarios from &quot;playing forward&quot; physical time.  This is external to physical time where &quot;The past is done and the future has not happened yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have to keep in mind in this world-view, the physical and non are separated on a level where what applies to the physical may not to the non; including physical constants like time and space.<br />

You see, physicality is a one frame game.  But fanning out from the present is a multitude of lines of probability.  What has occurred in the past will describe the possible states of the future.  Just like we can use spatial-temporal reasoning to do problem solving everyday, supposedly, we can extrapolate possible future events and scenarios from &quot;playing forward&quot; physical time.  This is external to physical time where &quot;The past is done and the future has not happened yet.&quot;

You have to keep in mind in this world-view, the physical and non are separated on a level where what applies to the physical may not to the non; including physical constants like time and space.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

You&#039;re saying that, on a Mental Scale, Time infact is in an infinite loop, where the Past,present,and future are one, however; on a Physical level, It is a straight line, and the future infact has not happened yet because we have not experienced it, therefore, it is a one frame thing.<br />
<br />

		<div id="post_7969" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I wouldn&#039;t conceptualize time as a &quot;loop.&quot;  Time is not that easy to conceptualize with a physical representation.  In the mental, all time and space are one.  Everything all at once.  Obviously this goes beyond physical abstraction.<br />
<br />
Time the mind and the universe is a complex concept that has many people thinking of explanations.  It&#039;s a hard thing to explain in language as it transcends semantics.<br />
<br />
With the &quot;space and time as one&quot; concept, a natural thought is to think &quot;well then the future has already happened just as the past has.&quot;  This causes one to think of experience like a stylus on a record player gliding through time on a predetermined path.<br />
<br />
Studies show that may be true, but only partially.  Understand, that it is action that creates history.  Real physical changes that &quot;writes down&quot; the changes made to space and time.  Under this concept, each person&#039;s observation of time draws their own &quot;time-line&quot; Their own historical path through history.  The rest of the universe manifests as you observe it during the time and relative spatial location in said universe.  Others alive and observing in the same time-frame, have time-lines that run parallel to yours.  The universe is &quot;shared&quot; among us all.  Now, if you take a &quot;top looking down&quot; view of time and space, all people, alive, dead, or yet to be, are all at once living their time-lines simultaneously in their respective &quot;time-frames.&quot;<br />
<br />
As confusing as it sounds, it fits together quite nicely.  Read about the 10 dimensions of quantum mechanics.<br />
<br />
Now we think &quot;well crap, our futures are determined and there&#039;s nothing we can do.&quot;   Not true.  Even if there is a future being lived right now, it&#039;s not YOUR future.  Your time-line, your &quot;universe&quot; is being lived by you and you alone.  The probable events of the future are probable because of the availability to information to describe it.  Since your mind is NOT part of the physical time, it is not a predetermined event.  What you think and in turn what you DO is not predetermined.  And that causes changes in what &quot;would normally happen given the history.&quot;<br />
<br />
Think of it this way.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/World_line.png" alt="External Image" /><br />
<br />
Take a look at this graph.  The past and future fan out from the present.  That &quot;hypsersurface of the present&quot; is home to all of our &quot;observer points&quot; as are the observer points of people in the past and the present as you move along the time dimension.  As energy changes through time, information present in the current formation is more prevalent than the information of the past.<br />
<br />
An example, the water in my cup that I got from the tap could have been moose testicle sweat or glacial spring water.  But after centuries of evaporating, condensing, ingesting, processing, evaporating, condensing and mixing, what the water &quot;was&quot; is so diluted (no pun intended), it makes little real difference in the water of today.  Of course without it, it wouldn&#039;t be here as it is, but at a point, the history &quot;fades into time&quot; as just potential.  But the observers in that time-frame will interact with it creating new (old) information pertinent to their experience.<br />
<br />
The same goes for the future.  Whatever happens in the future becomes less &quot;relevant&quot; to our present the further out it will occur.  Our changing of the past will have less and less effect on the distant future the further out it goes.  But that&#039;s proportional to the amount of change, which is proportional to the amount of energy spent.<br />
<br />
Still, it&#039;s an interesting thing to think about, but it takes a lot of sobering scientific and philosophical journeys to even begin to comprehend the ramifications.</div>

This Idea that things become less relevant the further from the present. It makes perfect sense to me.<br />

You see it in this way because you only are in one point in the present, one path, if you will, but there a million ways to get to that point in your life and a million different outcomes. The further you go, the more outcomes there are possible, and therefore the less relevant each one is. <br />

The simple fact of the matter is I agree and Support everything that Erik has said so far. all I&#039;ve really been doing throughout this thread is post my updated concept on the subject matter. Maybe I should post more on things that give more information, instead of my concepts, but I have found that saying stuff like that pushes the discussion further, and the further the discussion goes, the more knowledge we can all gain from it.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
