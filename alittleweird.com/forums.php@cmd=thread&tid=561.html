<br />
~Sean</div>Not only to organize memories but to shuttle them from short term to long term, which is why staying up all night to cram is of negligible value.<br />
<br />
I can also sleep up to 12 hours a night. And being here at the university has made my dreams more frequent and has given me some strange sense of being back at home and then I wake up and relize where I am. So it has made the whole process more interesting, whether or not I actually have a lucid one or not.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, that does not sound very healthy as others have mentioned. To get myself back on track I do not bother to go to bed and just stay up throughout the day until it comes time to go to sleep again, and usually by then I am tired enough to sleep fairly well and get up early enough to keep the cycle going, at least for a while.<br />
<br />
Any how hopefully that helps, somehow.<br />

I can also sleep up to 12 hours a night. And being here at the university has made my dreams more frequent and has given me some strange sense of being back at home and then I wake up and relize where I am. So it has made the whole process more interesting, whether or not I actually have a lucid one or not.

So to sum it up, that does not sound very healthy as others have mentioned. To get myself back on track I do not bother to go to bed and just stay up throughout the day until it comes time to go to sleep again, and usually by then I am tired enough to sleep fairly well and get up early enough to keep the cycle going, at least for a while.

Any how hopefully that helps, somehow.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Still, I believe there are people who don&#039;t NEED to sleep at all...its all about how you feel really, normally everyone would want to sleep when the time comes...(usually at night, noon naps too for some people), sleep when you are tired, when your body needs to, that&#039;s my belief.</div>
