They noticed wut was up and i told them. Then i was looking at audi, (the girl who lived their) and i saw her and her grandpa (deceased) in a forest he was near a light and on the other side was total darkness she was in the middle. after i said this she told me she had a dream the night her grandpa died that was exactly that. when it was time to leave we headed upstairs. I was standing theire waiting to get outside when i felt a really weird sensation going through me from front to back. Like when you inhale helium but way too much and it kinda hurts ur stomack. ya thats the feeling. i asked my friend if that was a ghost going through me and she just smiled and said &quot;yaa&quot;.

You watch David Blaine&#039;s street magic and you see those guys looking at the camera. Angel&#039;s people never look at the camera like professionals or something idk. I enjoy Angel though entertaining but I think he&#039;s just an Illusionist for stuff like that. Some stuff he does is unexplainable though.<br />
Hey Sheepking I&#039;ve done that dissapearing thing. I was making a psi-ball in the basement of my friends house my friends were in the other area of the basement playing around. I decided to go sit on the couch and make a psi-ball. I heard one of my friends coming downstairs or them in the other room questioning where I was. So I&#039;m like hhmmm I don&#039;t want to be disturbed I&#039;m not important just a box not important just a box. My friend came downstairs looked dead at me walked to where my friends where and said where is Slick?? I was highly amused they started looking for me I couldn&#039;t control my laughter though was cool experience. </div>

It wasnt too busy or anything. when i was by the bread oven a cup &quot;flew&quot; (almost literally) out of the holder. It moved about two feet, but it was only the one cup. I have notice that things move and fall of ledges when i get really overwhelmed, but this was way weird.

Well it&#039;s not as weird as some of the other things in here, but it was to me. I was experimenting with fading (My word for blending into the surroundings.) <br />
<br />
It was near the end of school in my band class, we had already finished our last performance so we were all just walking around talking and playing cards. I was becoming quite bored so I decided that it might be a good time to actually test my results from fading. I asked two of my friends at different times, to look for me after a few minutes. The first friend the fading was a success, he looked right at me and his eyes just kind of slid away from me until his second time looking at me. The second trial was not quite as good but I was not found by sight. My other friend just closed his eyes a moment, I believe he must have extended his field, as soon as I felt it the energy &quot;locked onto me&quot; for lack of a better word, It was a very interesting feeling, like someone grabbing your arm except it was more like grabbing my aura or field. He just looked over and pointed at me afterwards.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed that other psions seem to be able to look through any kind of fading a bit better than most?<br />
