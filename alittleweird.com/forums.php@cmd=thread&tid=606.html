As far as I&#039;m concerned, I think my greatest achievment is &quot;absorbing&quot; some electricity in a battery and putting it in my DS. Fingers felt weird, so I&#039;m counting it as a sucsess.

I was lifting my weights and could not hold the bar up very well one time and the weight bench started to tilt backwards.It was the winter time and I struggled with all my strength to put the bar back on the bench. By the time I got the bar back on I looked at my watch (i don&#039;t wear it when lifting)which was nearby on a stand had stopped or was actually still moving but the second hand would not pass the 11 on the watch.I was freaked out at the weights almost falling on me and thought nothing of the watch.I gave the watch a smack and it started to run as normal.Then about 5 months later I was lifting weights again early in the morning and I could not lift anymore, the weights felt really heavy after lifting a few reps and the bar started to tilt down towards me at one end. I used all my strength to get the bar on the bench one side of the bar at a time.I was wiped and I looked at my watch again on this occasion and again it was stopped . The second hand would not pass the 11.The second hand would just go back and forth at the eleven and before the 11 it would not cross it.I gave it a smack again and it started running as usual although after that it gradually got slower and the battery died 2 mons later.The moral of the story is to have someone to spot you when you do weights or trick out your bench so you don&#039;t need anyone,I tricked out my bench after that.</div>

		<div id="post_12001" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve done something similar to Atrum, whenever my mp3 player use to run out of batteries on my way home from school, i would take the batteries out and  hold them, and imagine i was taking energy from the trees and plants i walked by, putting it into the batteries.  They would always work for the rest of the way home.   Mind you it may have been caused by simply taking the batteries out of my mp3 player and then back in. But it happened many many times, so it makes me think:P  <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also remote viewed a persons grandmother, and with only knowing her name and age, described exactly what she looked like, including her walking frame, again this could have been just a coincidence, but it could be seen as something... best not to follow something with blind faith though.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the moving of the psi wheel.  Though i think the most psi thing i&#039;ve experienced wasn&#039;t done by me.  Me and my little brother when to the park and were trying to make shields.  I told him to make one and i would touche him and see what happened.. when he was ready i reached out and about 10cm from his shoulder i felt electricity surge up my arm, it didn&#039;t hurt but gave me a bit of a shock.<br />
<br />
With all that in mind i am very skeptical, and would invite you all to be so too.  I feel that if people could do extraordinary things like so many &#039;youtube&#039; videos, and forums claim, then there would be groups of people who would use there powers to help others, where no one else could.  I dunno, thats my two cents, and its probably gone way off topic.</div>

Edit: Actually, the first physical manifestation that really jogged my interest in psionics happened quite a few years ago when I was staring at an open Christmas card (lying face down) and trying to get it to move. I stared at it for about 15 minutes, visualizing energy flowing toward it, and then suddenly the open half of the card bobbed down and then back up. That was the first and only time I&#039;ve been able to move anything besides a psi wheel and (possibly) a needle floating on water.</div>
