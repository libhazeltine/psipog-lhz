		<div id="post_7851" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">My thoughts on the &quot;Energy-Vampire&quot; topic:<br />
<br />
I am of the opinion that the mind (external from the brain) requires energy to operate intellectually and semi-emotionally.  A properly nourished body has the bio-chemistry needed to power the physical workings of the body and mind-body interface.<br />
<br />
By our own nature, we unconsciously cultivate from our environment the energies needed to operate our mind on a level beyond just &quot;existing.&quot;  Just as we eat food to fuel our physical bodies, we &quot;channel&quot; energy into our mind to fuel our consciousness.  Whether we are aware of it or not.<br />
<br />
Now, energy is not just some quantity of power coming from nowhere.  It has a history.  All of it.  Just as a person or object has a history that describes its passage through time, so do environmental energies.  This encoded information is consumable just as the energy itself is.  Once the energy is converted, that bit of history will co-mingle with the receiver and extra information can be perceived. <br />
<br />
This process is very passive and to the average person, however the experience of this can be right in the front of their mind.<br />
<br />
Those who become more aware of subtler energies and begin to consciously manipulate them on a daily basis, work out the &quot;energy cultivating mechanisms&quot; to a greater degree; ESPECIALLY those with the attitude that &quot;more energy is better&quot; or &quot;I am energy deficient and need more.&quot;  On an unconscious level, you could be pulling more energy from your environment (and other people) to do your energy work.<br />
<br />
Now, I speak of this not in the tone of a rogue psion sucking energy from various victims, but as a normal human being.  This is a normal thing.  This is part of being human.  As a matter of fact, I feel, that this mechanism is actually the CRUCIAL &quot;everybody has it&quot; device that we use for manipulating energy and any other mental energy work.  It connects us to others, our environment and the universe.  Dare I say, without this, our mind would not survive (or exist).<br />
<br />
I have a longer rant about links, information and energy but I&#039;ll save that for later.  ^__^<br />
<br />
But being an &quot;Energy Vampire&quot; is like being a &quot;popcorn hog;&quot; it is just a potent simile describing an observation.  A charismatic and open person is energized being around interested listeners.  Just as a room of mopey people could bring a chipper person down to their level.<br />
<br />
People who become more aware of energy and how it affects them can react positively and negatively to their environment more than others.  Often overreacting.<br />
<br />
The one example of &quot;energy vampire&quot; that is the truest for the namesake is the person that feels the conscious need to specifically extract energy from a specific target over fear of depleting their own supply.  A theory I have is that they, have too much conscious control over the gathering of energy and see the need to control it consciously all of the time perhaps they have even &quot;damaged&quot; their ability to do it naturally and NEED to control it.  I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
In any event, I personally feel that over 99% of the cases of &quot;energy vampires&quot; are just normal people slightly more aware of their energy and are complaining about the effects they perceive from the quality of the energy they receive.  Crappy job with a mean co-worker, polluted energy being absorbed, mental and emotional effects observed.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s life.<br />

		<div id="post_7854" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Nicely Said Erik! Here&#039;s my take on the Psychic Vampire, I think you&#039;re on to something with what you&#039;re saying, This is all that I&#039;ve gathered through searching, expirimenting, andgennerally observing the Case of Psychic Vampirism without the religeous backwash you&#039;ll find on other site&#039;s that talk about this.<br />
<br />
An energy vampire or, as some people would put it, a psi-vamp is just an average human being, a psion could easily be a psi-vamp, considering it&#039;s just a combination of other techniques we already use. <br />
<br />
First off, Telepathy and Empathy use links between people in order to read the natural energy fields that surround us (called an aura for those who didn&#039;t know) and derive from them emotions and thoughts. <br />
<br />
What I think a Psi-Vamp does is take that same type of link, and syphon the persons energy from them, kindof like drinking milk from a straw.<br />
<br />
Now, as for the repricussions... The human body&#039;s aura is Like a musical chord, a harmony of thoughts and emotions, and everybody has different auras, atleast at a very small level (there are probably a few exeptions to this, possible twins, but that&#039;s beside the point). Going back to our reference of aura&#039;s being like a musical chord, what happens when two chords mix? The most common result is an unharmonious chord, the same thing goes for auras.<br />
<br />
The effects, from what I can Gather, are mood swings, or a white, or otherwise damaged aura.<br />
<br />
There are ways to get around this, but for the most part not worth the time it takes because it defeats the purpose of having drained it.<br />
<br />
I hope I could be of some help to clear out some confusion about psychic Vampirism.<br />
<br />
By the Way, Sean, Nice site! Your old one helped me quite a bit in my studies of Psionics and I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how this one turns out ^_^.</div>

<br />
I feel that is very much true, though &quot;waging war&quot; is a bit strong of descriptor.  ^__^<br />
<br />
Naturally, we act instinctively to survive.  If your mind needs energy to survive, it will act accordingly to acquire it.  Whether you are aware of it or not.  However, as I mentioned before, in increased awareness of this may actually cause some people to &quot;overact&quot; and pull more energy than needed or directly target a &quot;victim&quot; to pull the energy from rather than use the natural ambients.<br />
<br />
Everybody is leeching energy from their environment and others.  It&#039;s part of living.  At no point should the exchange of energy between people, known or unknown be considered intrinsically negative.  Like anything, it is the intent behind it that matters.  When you are inspired my a musician, holding hands with your lover, invigorated at a sporting event or giggling at a comedy club, the energy you are exchanging with those around you &quot;connect&quot; you to them on an emotional and spiritual level.  Communicating the deepest level of language in the purest way possible.  On the same token, angry people worked in to a mob-like fervor can invigorate emotions charged with an entirely different intent.  Bullies could bring the worst out of the best people simply by how the negativity is manifested in the target.<br />
<br />
When you become aware enough of these energies, you will be able to &quot;filter&quot; what is encoded in the energy and be able to stay in control of yourself.<br />
<br />
I have reasons to believe that on the &quot;road to awareness&quot; &quot;vamping&quot; is a natural step that many people take.  When they become more sensitive to their energies, but still lack experience and control, they may get more paranoid from the feedback or perhaps overzealous in their early manipulation habits.  Once you get your balance and have good perspective and control, &quot;vamping&quot; should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
It has its utility in a pinch, but is generally unnecessary if you know what you&#039;re doing.<br />
<br />

When you are inspired my a musician, holding hands with your lover, invigorated at a sporting event or giggling at a comedy club, the energy you are exchanging with those around you &quot;connect&quot; you to them on an emotional and spiritual level.  Communicating the deepest level of language in the purest way possible.  On the same token, angry people worked in to a mob-like fervor can invigorate emotions charged with an entirely different intent.  Bullies could bring the worst out of the best people simply by how the negativity is manifested in the target.

When you become aware enough of these energies, you will be able to &quot;filter&quot; what is encoded in the energy and be able to stay in control of yourself.

I have reasons to believe that on the &quot;road to awareness&quot; &quot;vamping&quot; is a natural step that many people take.  When they become more sensitive to their energies, but still lack experience and control, they may get more paranoid from the feedback or perhaps overzealous in their early manipulation habits.  Once you get your balance and have good perspective and control, &quot;vamping&quot; should not be a problem.

It has its utility in a pinch, but is generally unnecessary if you know what you&#039;re doing.

Very interesting comment. What about a hermit who lives away from all other human life? The hermit would only be near nature, unless you believe there is energy interaction between nature and humans as well? If so, are there perceivable outcomes of the energy interaction between a human and nature? </div>

get a potted plant, and a friend who will not mind being drained a small bit ever day.<br />
for 1 week drain a small amount of energy from your friend and record anything thats different from when you started, like in the way you feel and act.

It sounds like a fine experiment, one that I think has been done similarly before.  I encourage anyone to try it.  Unfortunately, I&#039;m in the middle of a move and I have so many other experiments on the table, the data I would get from this one won&#039;t justify putting the others on hiatus.<br />
<br />
Still, if conducted well, that experiment could show some interesting data.<br />

Wandering Wolf:<br />
<br />
One has to be very careful when diagnosing human energy malfunctions.  ESPECIALLY with  a heavily &quot;awareness&quot; rooted problem such as this.  If she is aware of or can sense the energy anomaly, she has already acknowledged it.  If you are told &quot;this is because of this&quot; and are convinced that is the problem, mentally your subconscious could &quot;settle-in&quot; to this dysfunction thinking that it is the normal way to function.  Like someone who loses a limb adapting (not instinctively using the missing appendage).<br />
<br />
Since I feel the mechanism at &quot;fault&quot; in psi-vamping is the same mechanism we use for exchanging energy with our environment.  Targeted control exercises could entrain more naturally functioning energy &quot;cultivation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here is one example of an exercise that I have seen results with.<br />
<br />
As you interact with the world, take a moment to look at everything around you.  Cognitively think about &quot;what has energy.&quot;  Visualize energy from your environment streaming THROUGH you.  Remember, energy is not just absorbed and spent.  You are putting out energy just as much as you get in.  Grounding through the energy around you revitalizes the natural mechanisms and if you do it enough, you should be able to do it more effortlessly with the passing of time until you do it naturally without thinking.  Like &quot;tuning back into the radio station&quot; or &quot;re-establishing the connection to the server&quot;  ^__^<br />
<br />
A person suffering from asthma often has to take deeper conscious breaths to supply their body with enough oxygen because their normal breaths can&#039;t bring enough in to their system.  Breathing exercises can help sufferers learn a more capacitive breathing volume that accommodates for their dysfunction.  Even if the affliction doesn&#039;t leave, you can return to a fairly normal life only having to manage occasional flare-ups.<br />
<br />
I feel psi-vamping can be managed (or eliminated) in a similar way.<br />
<br />
But this is a complex issue that needs a lot of investigation.  I would like to note that there is no evidence that suggests that there IS NOT a physiological connection that contributes to this.  The body&#039;s energy can reflect its physical state as well as its empathic state.  There have been studies that suggest a neurological and physiological connection to chakras and your physical body.  It&#039;s all an interconnected system.  If she has a real physical problem like a spinal injury or other nerve dysfunction, there may be a connection that simple exercises won&#039;t overcome.<br />
<br />
Still, when it comes to energy manipulation in general, I can not emphasize enough the importance of awareness and control exercises.<br />
<br />
I hope your friend can get past her problem.  Though I can not speak from experience, I can imagine how uncomfortable it would be to have to &quot;harvest&quot; energy consciously to stay &quot;topped-off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Take care.<br />

That would likely be the main problem in helping psi vampires. Fortunately, my psi vampire friend is highly intelligent and open-minded, much like most of the members on this forum. I am certain that she wouldn&#039;t mind giving it a try. She also seems to have considerable influence in various psi vampire communities, so she could act as a medium to spread awareness of this possible solution.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I would never tell her that this is pure, proven fact and that she should start preaching it to her fellow psi vampires. I will present the idea to her and ask that she experiments with it herself and then let others try one-by-one if it turns out to be a success.<br />
<br />
I also agree with your asthma analogy. It sounds tedious, but beneficial nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the informative answer.<br />

P.S. That experiment sounds like it is worth looking into. I may even try it myself one day. The only problem with it would be ruling out other possible contributing factors to the plant&#039;s increase in vitality. <br />

On a personal level (coming from someone who has very little experience) my first thoughts were that we really don&#039;t need &quot;mental energy&quot; to survive, but then again if we didn&#039;t, we probably would function just like a robot, to put it bluntly, Which is almost how I function so its quite understandable coming from me.<br />
<br />
My second thoughts were that most people just found out that they could take others energies and used it almost like a drug, or they just accidentally started pulling more and more energy from others, so they became addicted. Again, all of this is being put very bluntly (I&#039;m a simple minded person).<br />
<br />
I do not believe that a person is born being a psi vamp. Why, I don&#039;t really know. It could come from some subconscious pleasure that acts as a drug, quite like the way homosexuals are (and I&#039;m not trying to be bias). <br />
<br />
True, I have barely even experienced any kind of psychic ability (even empathy) So I have no room to talk about psi vamps existing. Just my own thoughts on the matter. <br />
<br />
so ace_of_spades, I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re feeling. But if I was ever to meet you, I wouldn&#039;t mind letting you feed off of me. It would be a nice little experiment on my part...or maybe I just enjoy gambling with my life...*smile*<br />

I would have to say that I agree with Erik&#039;s Reaoning to an extent. It&#039;s pretty simple to that that desire drives need. To say that you desire to be empathic, you may find out that you then require to sense others emotions. <br />
<br />
Why wouldn&#039;t it be the same with Vampirism?<br />
<br />
I know the Physical method of Concience draining of others energy, but I&#039;ve neverhad any desire for it, for the power that it has. So I won&#039;t gain any addiction.<br />
<br />
If I desire to have the &quot;energy&quot; of others, That need is created and, as sure as we are human, we subconciencly try to fufill our needs.<br />

I&#039;d recommend making a very strong initial energy absorbtion before programming the construct so that you can have the energy build up quickly as the construct takes effect throughout the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
Obviously, if that doesn&#039;t work you will have to either try other methods (such as akio&#039;s method or Erik&#039;s method) or you will simply have to give in to your cravings and absorb energy from people again. If it comes to that you may be able to try to reduce the amount of times you feed, much like how a smoker cuts down on cigarettes by smoking one (or more) less cigarettes each given reduction period.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am sorry to hear about the hardships that your psi vampiric disposition burdened you with. It&#039;s times like these that make me hope that Erik&#039;s theory holds validity. My psi vampire friend is more fortunate than you in that she feeds subconsciously and therefore does not need to deal with as much guilt, but all psi vampires should be given the chance to learn how to find healthier ways to survive.<br />
