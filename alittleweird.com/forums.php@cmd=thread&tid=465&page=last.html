it seems that your chakra is very well developed (is that the way to put it?) but what exactly do you feel when practising it? i would really love to try it, but the whole idea still sounds a little scary, this negative-energy issue. and wow, what are those troubles? i would surely need some chakra, if this is the case.<br />

im sure tancy was referring to you....cause my chakras aint that well developed yet. maybe more developed than an average person, but definitely not as much as yours.<br />
btw, im sure you are more experienced than i am, so if you dont agree with what i say, you can feel free to point it out, and everyone might be able to learn from it.<br />
<br />
@tancy<br />
when you do these chakra exercises, you would normally either feel a tingling sensation at your chakras, or your chakras might feel warmer than usual. these are some signs that your chakra is activated and being filled with energy.<br />
about the negative energy thing, well i never had much experience with it, but then i know that it isn&#039;t good to harbour negative energy within your body, cause it might make you fall ill easily and upset the balance in your body. it might also make you become pessimistic, and as a result you might manifest some terrible events in your life.<br />
i think it is a good idea to develop your chakras before negative energy finds you. at least that energy would have a hard time trying to harm you, cause your body would be filled with positive energy when your chakras are developed.</div>

This is a powerful exercise, but it requires great caution. for those who do not know what kundalini is, it is actually a type of powerful energy which is usually dormant in a person. it is usually quite dangerous to force the kundalini to awaken.<br />
however, i found a brainwave track by Kelly Howell, which can help you awaken kundalini safely, and energise your chakras. i&#039;ve been using it for quite some time, and i&#039;ve not experienced any of the negative effects associated with kundalini awakening so far.<br />

you can also choose to search for the free download of this track on google, but you need bittorrent for that.</div>

for me, visualising or not visualising doesnt make much of a difference to me, but honestly i feel that robert bruce&#039;s techniques are quite effective, after trying them a few times. hope it works for you guys too:)<br />

what you described are some signs of having one or more developed chakra(s). eg, you dont feel sad easily, meaning your heart chakra might be more developed than any other person. a person could show different signs, depending on the chakra(s) that is more developed. eg, a person who has a developed crown chakra might possess wisdom that most people would not have, something like enlightenment, but not exactly. a person with a developed root chakra can ground himself easily, and always feel stable and secured.<br />
as for being able to feel or perceive energy moving through your body, that doesnt have much to do with your chakras. i believe you would be able do that when you&#039;ve practised EM long enough.(actually you can also use EM to move energy to your chakras to stimulate it)<br />
btw, actually i dont like to associate the adjective &quot;stronger&quot; or &quot;weaker&quot; with chakras, cause these are usually associated with things that can exert a force, like people or gravitational fields or magnetic fields, but then chakras aint even physical in nature, so they dont really exert a force. normally i use &quot;more/less developed&quot; or sometimes just &quot;developed&quot; to describe chakras, but &quot;more/less energetic&quot; sounds fine too, just like describing the energy body, as the chakras are energy centres after all.</div>

my advice to you is to not just concentrate on your third eye chakra, but also your other chakras as well. this is prevent any imbalances from happening due to the overdevelopment of one chakra.<br />
if you are good in EM, i believe you would be able to see results in 1 or 2 weks time if you practice everyday.<br />
wishing you good luck:)</div>

strictly speaking there isnt really any definite &#039;limit&#039; to how much everyone should develop their chakras. it all depends on the individual. when you do chakra exercises you should try to do as much as your body can take it and not overdo it, so this is a limit in some sense. as for the extent of your chakras&#039; development, you dont need to worry about any limits if you do exercises for all your chakras to make them balanced. <br />
<br />
the problems only come when some of your chakras become overdeveloped while others become underdeveloped. what i mean by an overdeveloped chakra is one which spins too much faster as compared to other chakras. similarly, an underdeveloped chakra spins much slower than other chakras. i believe this definition makes more sense, rather than saying a chakra is overdeveloped because it has exceeded a &#039;speed limit&#039;. when all your chakras are well developed, they will be balanced, and they will spin very fast, converting large amounts of raw energy from our environment to useful energy in our body. if we apply this &#039;speed limit&#039; to our chakras, then all our chakras would become &#039;overdeveloped&#039;. but this is contradictory as something that has gone overboard cant be balanced. also, when your chakras are balanced, they all spin with similar speeds. thats why i say that my definition of &#039;overdevelopment&#039; is better than this &#039;speed limit&#039; concept.<br />
<br />
as for the third question, my chakras are still developing, slowly but steadily. i believe that developing my chakras the longer way is better as it has long term benefits, rather than doing it so quickly till you hurt yourself. also i didnt use the same method as akio did, and thats still currently so, i believe. akio mentioned in one of his earlier post that he had his own method, which im not very sure of, while i use kundalini awakening and NEW Energy Ways to develop my chakras. <br />
<br />
side note: im doing the kundalini awakening in a safe and proper way. kundalini can be dangerous if awakened improperly. you can try the mantra and visualisation methods in rick richard&#039;s site(the link is found in an earlier post in this thread), or you can use robert bruce&#039;s NEW Energy Ways. both methods are safer alternatives for kundalini awakening.</div>

for me, the lower order of evolution could mean spirits, ghosts, or even demons, while the higher order of evolution would be angels, spirit guides, keepers or even God Himself(i got this from an article in www.psipalatium.com about angels, spirits ...).<br />
<br />
as for humans, i think that it&#039;s subjective as to whether they belong to the higher or lower order of evolution. there are some people in this world who has committed heinous crimes, done inhumane acts, and you wouldnt consider them to be in the higher order of evolution, would you? there are also some people who you know will definity go to heaven when they leave this world, and it wouldnt make sense to say that these people belong to the lower end of evolution. thats why i say it&#039;s subjective when it comes to classifying humans in the hierachy of evolution.<br />

		<div id="post_11592" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi there. Someone might remember me from old times of psipog. Oh well, back to business before it&#039;s time to get some sleep. As what comes to cakras (oh yes, that&#039;s a first thing to notice, when speaking of cakras, there&#039;s no letter h in middle of it (chakra), it&#039;s originally cakra), I must say, they do exist and they do control your bodys&#039; awereness and wellness. For example, when one has problems with his/her inner organs (like liver or what ever else), I&#039;ve found out that with good control of your cakras you may stimulate that &quot;ill&quot; organ, and take the pain away. Like, if you suffer of constipation, with a help of yoga master and some practise, you&#039;ll get rid of it. If one thinks yoga is only stretching, one is wrong. To be exact, yoga is some moves which contains stretching in a way where you notice your vital energy grows, and you&#039;ll get control of energy flows in your body (through cakras).<br />
<br />
Nevertheless I was little bit sceptic about cakras at times when I started to practise my energies and psi/chi, but nowdays I notice I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong.<br />
<br />
Cakras are invisible energy centers in your body, and are located everywhere around it. Main 7 cakras are mostly known, just because when you have control of them, you may start exploring others (which are minor areas/spots, but not irrelevant).<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no right path to start exploring world of psi, but most of you are already on a way to something better if you just have enough patience to discover this hard and long path. Hopefully we&#039;ll meet again if I don&#039;t lose this address :)<br />
