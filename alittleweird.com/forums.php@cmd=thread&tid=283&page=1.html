 Favorite Music: I like just about all music, but I really like to hear strange artists, that don’t try to fit some specific Genre.<br />

 Hobbies: Drawing, writing, animation, filmmaking, role-playing, video gaming, psionics and basically designing anything from my own games to t-shirts.<br />
<br />
Reason You Are Here: There are a lot of reasons why I’m here, basically to be with people learning and practicing the same things as me. Psionics is not just a light interest to me. The things I have learned on Sean’s sites has furthered my vision of reality and improved me as a person. I can see the corrupt societal views of today dieing, as people in general improve gradually like they have always done. I am here to be doing my part to build a better tomorrow, too.<br />

 Favorite Music: I like just about all music, but I really like to hear strange artists, that don’t try to fit some specific Genre.

 Favorite Color: Red, but I like all colors in their own way.

 Favorite Book: Too many.

 Favorite Artist: Too many.

 Hobbies: Drawing, writing, animation, filmmaking, role-playing, video gaming, psionics and basically designing anything from my own games to t-shirts.

Reason You Are Here: There are a lot of reasons why I’m here, basically to be with people learning and practicing the same things as me. Psionics is not just a light interest to me. The things I have learned on Sean’s sites has furthered my vision of reality and improved me as a person. I can see the corrupt societal views of today dieing, as people in general improve gradually like they have always done. I am here to be doing my part to build a better tomorrow, too.

Sex: Male<br />

Location: York, England<br />

Favorite Music: Bad question. I&#039;d list all my favourite composers, but then this would quickly become boring... so I&#039;ll go with &quot;classical&quot; music from about 1830 onwards... plus more or less anything with a violin in. I&#039;m not even kidding. Oh, and Russian composers ftw.<br />
<br />
Favorite Colour: Green or purple. I am a stunner in black with my auburn hair, though. Anything but yellow is good. =)<br />
<br />
Favorite Book: Oh, no. Er. No, I pass, there are far too many.<br />
<br />
Favorite Artist: See above.<br />
<br />
Hobbies: Music - I&#039;m a violinist/saxophonist/violist/flautist/pianist. Hence my ridiculous music degree in the making. Psionics. Reading random crap. Baking cakes and cookies. Oooh, yum. Learning languages. Speaking foreign languages.<br />
<br />
Photo: I refuse to post one until I have one of me with my new hair. It&#039;s hot. =D<br />
<br />
Reason You Are Here: I was upset when I came back from a huge break from psionics to find Psipog had been archived, and managed to find my way here from there. I&#039;m glad I did. =)<br />
<br />
Psionic Abilities: Current ones, or all I&#039;ve ever done? Current - MacroTK on a small scale, but I am improving constantly! I&#039;m also fairly sure I retained some skill at telepathy. But that was always random and unfocused anyway. =) Back in the day, I was fairly competent at energy manipulation, spurts of telepathy, pathetic progress at TK, and I also dabbled in OBEs. However, I managed to freak myself out so much with that that I stopped.<br />
<br />
Others: I&#039;m a bit obsessive. I got a 75% score when I took a Machiavellian test thing. I speak French and German in abundance, uncontrollably when I have the drink taken. That&#039;s more or less all you need to know about me. =0 =)<br />
