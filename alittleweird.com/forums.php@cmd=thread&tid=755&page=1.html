I found a link to PsiPog and I was looking for a community to join.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really interested in learning psionics, but I have no idea what to start with. I&#039;ve heard and read a bit about telekinesis and psiballs. What path do people usually take to start training?<br />
<br />
The only paranormal encounters that have happened to me so far are dreams that, if I can make sense of them (because they don&#039;t really show the exact thing) I can vaguely predict what will happen, but it only happens very rarely, usually before important events, such as the first time I went on a plane, I knew someone on the trip would be injured. It could just be dreams, but they seem too real and they don&#039;t fade away over time after waking up.<br />
<br />
So do you have ideas of where I should start?<br />
<br />
PS: Do things like this run in the family? My grandfather seems to be pretty good at stuff like this (Heating up his hands, making aches leave with thoughts and slight movements of the hand) My cousin can also see a man standing there starring at her when she wakes up at night and when he&#039;s there, she can&#039;t move or make any noise.</div>

You are good on finding stuff in Veritas, Falcon.<br />
I would recommend on training yourself first: Learn meditation, Grounding and Centering. Then feeling the psi. Afterwards you may start with your psiballs.</div>

<br />
Personally, I don&#039;t think making psiballs is even necessary, with a good basis you will find yourself able to do Kinetics (all sorts of Psychokinesis) and forms of Scanning. (Telepathy, Empathy etc.) Energy Manipulation is not something I would encourage to beginners, though it is often thought of as the easiest practice, I think that&#039;s not the case, and is most prone to problems such as biofeedback.<br />
<br />
So, start with increasing your focus, being able to meditate for long periods of time, (about 20 minutes is okay, don&#039;t START with 20 minutes, build it up slowly!) and try to become aware of everything you do. That is, don&#039;t eat without reading comics, watching tv etc. I would consider this last step to be optional, but it will greatly increase your overall focus in life.<br />
After that, start working on Kinetics and Scanning. And AFTER having the basics of at least Kinetics under control, I would advice starting on Energy Manipulation.<br />

NO, don&#039;t try to listen to black metal and meditate, although it might work, but usually it just sets your mood to bad and sad. Someone likes psy-trance, others DnB, but best is the one that sets your energy flow free. For me, it&#039;s different violin chords, high voices (female singers etc) and so forth. Just go ahead and listen to different types of music, close your eyes and just let it work, feel how it effects on you. Try to live the music, like what kind of attitude or state of mind it creates. If you&#039;re familiar with cakras, then try focusing on what cakra some music works, and thatwise forwards.. Hope it helps :)<br />

Anyway, to go to the original question. Yes, you cán use music for your meditation, concentrating on music is the same thing as concentrating on anything else, so it can be used.
