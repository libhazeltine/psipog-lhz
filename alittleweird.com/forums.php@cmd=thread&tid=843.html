I recently started looking into magick, rituals and symbolism and all that stuff and I&#039;m finding it very interesting. I&#039;m picking up demonology and I thought magick would be a cool thing to check out along with it. But there&#039;s only one problem: I know next to nothing about the subject.<br />

I mean, I&#039;ve got a few books on demons and such for demonology, but I can&#039;t find anything about magick. There are websites about it here and there, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be much help for the beginners on them. How would you suggest I go about starting out?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also heard about different type of magick. Terms like Chaos Magic and Hermetics. Rune Magic was also one of them. Are they different systems? What&#039;s the difference?<br />
<br />
PS: In psionics people are either referred to as psions or psychics, but when it comes to magick, I&#039;ve read about magi, sorcerers, magicians, magickans... Is there a general term most people use?</div>

<br />
How you would go about starting out depends entirely upon what you are trying to achieve with Magic, so, if you don&#039;t mind, I will first try to give an answer to your other questions.<br />
<br />
Chaos Magic, Hermetics and Runic Magic are different systems. Chaos Magic is a form of sorcery wherein there are no real &#039;rules&#039;, so to speak. People from the Chaos Magic paradigm believe that faith and belief is the real key to success (= achieving what you want, aka a spell). You can use whatever belief you want, there are sorcerers who use the &#039;force&#039; (yes, from Star Wars), or they make up their own &#039;system&#039;.<br />
<br />
Another system is Runic Magic, personally, I&#039;d say this is more of a compliment in your training, and not a complete system. Technically, it cán be a complete system of magical development, but most people who try this out start writing down (sigilizing) some runes and are happy when they&#039;ve cast them and get some results.<br />
<br />
Hermetics is the form of magic I am personally practicing, (in a way, I am not a 100% Hermetic, though,) in my opinion, it is the most complete system of Magic. However, this depends on what you want. Hermetics focuses mostly on developing the spirit, so as to allow Divine Consciousness to flow through it (aka merging with God). If this sounds way too religious and weird to you and you only want to use Magic for material ends, then this system is probably not for you. If you are interested in this however, I suggest you take up the Initiation into Hermetics by Franz Bardon and STICK WITH IT. It is the best book available on Hermetics (in my opinion) because it offers a complete system of training with ultimately results in merging with the God-form.<br />
<br />
You can probably look up Chaos Magic and Runic Magic yourself, I think Veritas has a good article on Runic Magic, and there are many, many articles on Chaos Magic. (Check out Phil Hine&#039;s website.)<br />
<br />
As for the different &#039;types&#039; of magicians. This is just a matter of personal preference, for me, as a Hermetic, I see a magician as the &#039;good guy&#039;. Because it comes from the word magia, which means wisdom. On the other hands, people from the Hermetic paradigm use the word &#039;sorcerer&#039; as a name for someone who solely uses Magic for material ends instead of spiritual development. So it is up to you, many people have different definitions.<br />

Kube, Hermetics isn&#039;t really religion-like, it&#039;s more for the spiritual person, nevertheless, I already had the impression you weren&#039;t looking for this. ;)<br />

On the other hand, Franz Bardon&#039;s Initiation into Hermetics offers a lot as well to someone who doesn&#039;t want to become a very spiritual person, I recommend you read it anyway, you can find an online copy <a href="http://vsociety.net/wiki/V-Library" target="_blank" title="http://vsociety.net/wiki/V-Library">here</a>. (Look under the section &quot;Bardon, Franz&quot;) Just read it, and after you&#039;ve read it as a whole, think about it what you want. (No, really, read it. It&#039;s different than you might think.)<br />
<br />
The difference between Magick and Magic is.. none. Magick is a term coined by Aleister Crowley to differentiate between the stage magician and the &#039;real&#039; magician.<br />

<br />
As for your question about picking bits of different systems, that is a possibility. You can, for example, make your own &#039;magic ritual&#039; wherein you go into trance using the Chaos method (gnosis), use the power of the runes (Runic magic),  and the god-names of Hermetics. *shrugs* On the other hand, I would recommend first mastering a single system .(Which is going to take a long, long time, so think before you start &quot;do I really want to follow this?&quot;) You will never increase in power if you take bits of all systems and end up with nothing.<br />

No, really, many people in the west tend to have the mindset of &quot;I can do it all myself!&quot;, and &quot;Certainly there is none in the world higher than I!&quot;, and though learning from books is fine if you don&#039;t have a teacher, it should néver replace the teacher.<br />
<br />
Hah, those who haven&#039;t already closed this page in disgust, might perhaps bring up the question &quot;Where do I find a good teacher? And how do I know he isn&#039;t a fraud?&quot;. This is a hard question, especially today, where frauds can be found anywhere. The best choice for most people is to find a magical order, though I have to admit that the quality of magical orders varies greatly, where the orders of higher quality tend to be a little bit more secretive. (These do, for example, not have websites, but contact people personally whom they think are ready for their teachings.)<br />
<br />
Of course, the order of choice depends upon your personal beliefs and inclination. I think, however, that I would recommend The Servants of the Light or The Rosicrucian Fellowship if I had to choose from some of the public orders.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, most people in the west want to learn by themselves. Though I personally think such a thing can only cause failure in the end, it is probably the best method for such people, because, to learn from a spiritual master, one has to be completely open to him/her, and not question something because you do not yet understand it. I realize that this is a difficult thing for most westerners to do.<br />
