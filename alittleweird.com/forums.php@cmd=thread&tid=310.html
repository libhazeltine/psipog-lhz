  I was flipping through on demand on the tv to look for  good movie because I was bored i looked through a few and one reminded me of a good movie called Unbreakable with Bruce Willis and Samuel. L Jackson that came out in 2000 . I only saw it once when it did come out in 2000. And i thought to myself that would be a good movie to watch right now but the on demand didnt have it so i dismissed it and watched a dvd i owned.<br />
<br />
    NOW tonight I am bored again flipping through the channels looking for a movie to watch. AND LOW AND BEHOLD Unbreakable is playing on USA! i have never ever seen any point in the past 8 years that this movie has ever been on tv and now after not having thought of the movie for years and then just thinking about it yesterday it comes on tv? what are the odds? such a weird coincidence. way too coincidental to me. And this is only one example this happens to me occasionally for different  things and they are always so oddly coincidental.<br />

if you want coincidence, a few years ago i was looking for something to watch on TV, and  i saw there was a movie on that i really wanted to see (forget what it was). it didn&#039;t start for another hour or so though, so i just muted the TV and did stuff on the internet. i forget the details, but i started getting really absorbed in whatever it was i was doing and completely forgot about everything else. then all of a sudden the TV turned itself off and on* thus unmuting itself. this happened at the exact same time the movie started, and was the only reason i ended up watching it.<br />

all the more reason to believe coincidence is more than people think i suppose.<br />

This kind of thing happens to me all the time, I actually keep a journal where I write them down when they happen so Ill remember them. I average about 3 to 4 a week, usually they&#039;re associated with some phrase or person.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t read a lot of it, but the Holographic Universe by Micheal Talbot seems like a pretty plausible explanation of crazy coincidences. He talks something about how reality is just a projection of our own minds, nothing is really there at all, and how our mind can create parallels and coincidences inside our reality.<br />

I really love this subject, I think Ill try to get a hold of that book.</div>

he should get in here and maybe discuss this more with us, see what he thinks.<br />

maybe theres some sort of unconscious suggestive projection, using empathy like dash said, where we project what we feel and want  onto the world and the world responds sometimes. i dont know. interesting though</div>

I think it&#039;s just a coincidence anyway. A coincidence is something that you just can&#039;t &quot;determine&quot; the connection between the two events - and doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they aren&#039;t related. If you can&#039;t see any direct relation, that&#039;s usually defined as coincidence.</div>

		<div id="post_7555" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Just a quick thought... it could be possible when one has these sorts of coincidences when referring to television programs, that advertising agencies actually send directly to your brain advertisements (possibly psychically).  However you hardly ever realize because you get the message at the same time as you are watching the ad.  However, it could be possible that for some reason occasionally you receive it before you see the ad;  or without even seeing the ad.  In which case the feeling that you really want to see the movie is achieved without you having to watch the advertisements.</div>
