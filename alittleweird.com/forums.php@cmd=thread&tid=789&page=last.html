		<div id="post_14347" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I just had the craziest experience.<br />
<br />
I was trying to trance out to get comfortable with the hypnogogic hallucinations that I always freak out over and I ended up almost getting out of body... as soon as the session started I knew I&#039;d be successful on some level, and I got extremely deep in meditation when I started pondering what my &quot;ethereal&quot; or whatever body would look like should I look at &quot;myself&quot; in a mirror while out of body...<br />
<br />
And while I was pondering this visually, I made some kind of indescribable connection, and I felt this really profound sense of &quot;alignment.&quot; I looked myself in the eyes in the mirror [mentally, in this visualization that I was completely lost in] and all of a sudden I was &quot;back&quot; in my body having easily the most intense vibrations I&#039;ve ever experienced. There was a very strong sense of heat, but none of it was painful or unpleasant, just intense.<br />
<br />
I felt my bond to my physical body &quot;melt&quot; or something in the heat and I heard/spoke simultaneously this voice in my head [it&#039;s hard to describe, but no, I&#039;m not &quot;hearing voices,&quot; I was just voicing a deeper concept I became aware of]... It was something along the lines of &quot;...You sure you&#039;re ready to do this?&quot; and I affirmed it to myself, and started rising, in some sense, completely out of body...<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to describe it, but it was very, very vaguely like a plane lifting off the runway, when you become acutely aware that the ground beneath the plane is now WWWWAAYYYYY beneath the plane, waaayyy down there... that&#039;s what it felt like in regard to my physical body... I felt like I would eventually just get &quot;tossed&quot; out of body completely if I held it long enough, but my heart was pounding and the adrenaline ultimately woke me up all the way. Mentally, I wasn&#039;t scared, although I was a tad nervous. Apparently my body was scared shitless =p<br />
<br />
Anyway sorry for the rambling, I figured I&#039;d share this before I lost the words completely.<br />
<br />
I must say though, the feeling of freedom while in that state is profound and exhilarating. I only hope I can achieve it again and take the next step further so I have something more interesting to report back.<br />
<br />
If I can ever get out consistently, I&#039;ll try some experiments and report back. Anyone have any good ideas about things I should try? [psiballs, flying, looking in the mirror, telepathy, interacting with &quot;physical&quot; people, telekinesis, morphing my ethereal body, seeing in 360 degrees, and such are stuff I can think of offhand...]</div>

On a  more serious note, though, that&#039;s pretty cool! I hope I can OBE soon too :)<br />

I was going to suggest trying telekinesis, but you&#039;ve already mentioned it... Maybe trying to see how far you can get from your physical self without being sent back to your body? Or see if animals react to your presence.</div>

		<div id="post_14353" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Haha, pretty good..  I might as well talk about my near OBE experience that just happened today.  (Man, I haven&#039;t posted in these forums for like 10+ months.)<br />
<br />
So I managed to wake  myself up at about 6am (went to bed at 1).  I decided to splash some water on my face from having me immediately go to sleep.  So when I get in my bed, I have my arms above my head, and my feet pointing inwards.  Usually I can stay still for quite some time waiting, but this time my arm kept itching, so eventually I decided to move and itch it because it got so annoying (bad idea).  Then it was getting really cold (had no covers on).  THEN eventually I wasn&#039;t comfortable lying on my back, so I decided to lay on my side..  All of these ruined my OBE.  Eventually I feel into a trance, but it wasn&#039;t a good trance..  My body wasn&#039;t numb (I kept moving it) and I didn&#039;t see it coming until I had it (the OBE).  When I finally had it, I decided to play with my arms first before leaving.  So, taking my right arm that was sort of floating there, I decided to push it against me bed.  I did that, and at first I was just pushing it.  Then I decided to push harder, and my hand went THROUGH the bed.  Then I feel asleep.  Which sucks.  I think this happened because I wasn&#039;t prepared right (kept moving when trying to lay still.)  I&#039;m sure if I actually STAYED still I would have not fallen asleep...<br />
<br />
Oh btw, I&#039;m so used to the hallucinations that sometimes I don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re there..  I seemed so passive, which might also be why I feel asleep.  I never felt (maybe once.. idk) any vibrations either.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this probably doesn&#039;t make sense, so I&#039;m sorry if it doesn&#039;t. :P (Grr, I&#039;m going to be able to get one soon I know it!  (Haha I used to get them so easily 1 1/2 years ago..))<br />

...<br />

When I actually DO have an OBE (a good one) one thing I like to do are back flips.  For me, instead of being weightless, I feel like I&#039;m being pulled down by moon-like gravity.  I can almost float, but not quite...</div>
