		<div id="post_12711" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I went to the chiropractor yesterday and he showed me my xrays. My lower back was .03 away from being severe it was so curved (and I&#039;m 16 o.o and have never been in an accident), so he tried to fix that. Anyways, it feels awesome now.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering, does anyone else go to a chiropractor and does it help with their psionics, chakras, or whatever? And kind of a side thing, I know energy flows outside the body too (auras), but is it stronger through the body or when outside the body is it stronger with less distance? <br />

I&#039;m going to try and shield later today to see if it works better...</div>

According to my doctor, I should be going to one.<br />
But I decided against it. It&#039;s not a permanent solution and it doesn&#039;t really help in the long run. Once you start going to one, you have to keep going. He realigns your spine. But it slowly starts to slip back. And that is EXTREMELY painful. Like...Lying in bed wanting to scream or cry kind of painful and not wanting to move. <br />
So then you go back. And he fixes it. And you feel better. Then you start the process all over again.<br />
Super.<br />
My dad has talked to people at work about it. My mom at her work. Plus they have their own experiences. And my grandmother talked to me about it. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just not worth it. Seriously. Don&#039;t let him eat your money.<br />
<br />
Unless you have crippling back pain all the time-in which case surgery would be better because when they align your spine surgically it actually STAYS (imagine that!).<br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t see how that would help with psionics. I could be wrong, but it seems totally unrelated.</div>
