				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>What is &#8220;Psionics&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Psionics&#8221; is an umbrella term for a variety of paranormal and psychic abilities.  Skills like Telepathy, Psychokinesis, Remote Viewing, Out-of-Body Experiences, Energy Manipualtion (Psi Balls, Shields, Constructs), Empathy, and Precognition.  The reality behind these skills is unknown, and they could all rely on different mechanisms to actually work, but they are still grouped together under the term &#8220;Psionics&#8221; simply due to their paranormal/psychic classification.</p>
<p><strong>Is it real?  Are you crazy?</strong></p>
<p>Since Psionics is an umbrella term, the &#8220;realness&#8221; of each skill has it&#8217;s own body of literature.  My personal experience and research, over the past decade, has led me to conclude that all the skills mentioned above are real.  Of course, I could just be a nut, or just making a few honest mistakes, so who cares what I think?</p>
<p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>
<p>For the few reading, I want you to take a step back.  What I mean by that is I want your mind to stop moving so much.  Instead of thinking about psionics, or about a particular skill, or how cool it would be, or how silly it all is, or all the questions&#8230; just stop.  Stop moving.  There is plenty of time to think about whatever you want after you&#8217;ve finished reading this article.  But for now, at the end of this sentence, just stop.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to freeze your body or breath.  Please, by all means, breathe normally, and relax your muscles.  Just stop thinking so damn much.  I&#8217;m not trying to put you in some voodoo trance or anything, I just need you to drop all your preconceived notions for a few minutes.  After you finish reading, you are free to restore all your beloved notions, so don&#8217;t worry :-).</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Puzzle</strong></p>
<p>After talking to thousands of people about psionics, I&#8217;ve noticed that there are two puzzles.  The first puzzle is obvious: is psionics real?  If so, how do I do it?  How does it work?  What about science and physics?  What about religion?  Am I insane?  This is the puzzle we try to solve.  This is the puzzle that we set our sites on, and work towards.</p>
<p>The second puzzle is hidden.  It&#8217;s the puzzle we&#8217;re <em>actually</em> solving, while we <em>think</em> we&#8217;re solving the first.  It is the puzzle of mind and meta-thought.</p>
<p>As long as the second puzzle remains unsolved, the first puzzle will always exist.  If you truly want to cease the questions in the first, you must solve the second.</p>
<p><strong>Not-Self Denial</strong></p>
<p>What happens, though?  We focus on the first, and because the second blocks our path, eventually we tire out and move on to something else.  But the second puzzle always remains&#8230; it infects everything.  Our limits, in any field, psionics or otherwise, is governed by mind.  It is only until we push hard enough that we notice this limitation.  Perhaps psionics will be the subject that motivates you to push that hard.  Probably not, though.</p>
<p>What will <em>probably</em> happen is that psionics will spark some curiousity, which will give you some fire for a while.  Maybe only enough motivation to finish this article, or maybe enough to read some more.  For the few, psionics will motivate beyond reading, and spark us to try some exercises out.  For the cursed, psionics might become a vessle for self-discovery and deeper understanding of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution of Psionics</strong></p>
<p>Show me a question, and I will show you an insatiable mind.</p>
<p>The evolution of psionics is the transition of focus from the external world to the internal.  I need you to make this transition, because your thoughts are killing me.  They&#8217;re killing you.  Just stop.  Stop.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t.  So run away&#8230; move on to something else.  Run as far as you can, until mind reaps another casulity.  Psionics was never really for you anyways.</p>

					<p>Alriightttyyy!</p>
<p>Enough of all this bullshit - it&#8217;s time to resume training!  I&#8217;ve resumed my OBE and EM training, and it feels good to <em>do</em> something :-).  I&#8217;ve decided to start holding weekly practice sessions with the geiger counter as well.  Every Sunday, at 7pm EST, feel free to meet in the <a href="../../geiger-game.php.html">geiger counter chat room</a>, and we can mess around collectively with the geiger counter.  I&#8217;ve added a timer to the page that counts down to the next practice session, so you know exactly when it will happen.</p>
<p>So, see you Sunday! <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Being human, we like to divide reality into different sections.</p>
<p>There is <strong>day</strong> time, and <strong>night</strong> time.  There is the <strong>weekday</strong>, and the <strong>weekend</strong>.  There are people with <strong>lighter</strong> skin, and <strong>darker</strong> skin.  This mentality of cutting reality in half has a name - it&#8217;s called: duality.</p>
<p>Dualistic thoughts can be very useful.  After all, if I want to drive from Maryland to Georgia, it&#8217;s good to know whether I&#8217;m on the <strong>correct</strong> road, or <strong>incorrect</strong> road.  However, a lot of times we use dualistic thinking incorrectly, or trust in it too much.</p>
<p>The problem is this: There is one, and only one, reality.  Thinking dualistically is in direct contradiction to that ultimate truth.  Is it ever <em>really</em> a weekend?  No.  It&#8217;s just the continuous stream of time.  If you go to mars, are there weekends there?  No.  Therefore, a &#8220;weekend&#8221; is not something that is a part of reality.  It&#8217;s just a human thing we do - we divide reality arbitrarily, and label the divisions.</p>
<p>How does this affect us?  Well, there&#8217;s a popular thought that is dualistic in nature, that I talk a lot about: <em>&#8220;If you want to become good at psychic abilities, you must practice.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Hiding behind this thought is a partitioned reality.  Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean the thought is useless.  Clearly there is some truth in there, because people who practice psychic abilities do become more proficient.  But ultimately - the thought has some inherent falsehoods because it&#8217;s reliant on cutting reality in half.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cuts the thought makes, but the one I want to discuss is that it divides experiences into either <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  Encoded inside of &#8220;practice psychic abilities to get better&#8221; is the thought that your current experiences are mostly &#8220;natural&#8221;, and if you want more &#8220;supernatural&#8221; ones, you need to practice.</p>
<p>This is the falsehood inside the thought.  An experience is neither <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  An experience is just an experience!  Reality doesn&#8217;t go around, observing events, judging whether something was bizarre or not - humans do!  Reality doesn&#8217;t give two shits, and just does what it does.  This division between everyday life, and some awesome and profound paranormal experience, only exists in our mind.</p>
<p>Usually dualism isn&#8217;t too bad.  In some cases it can be very dangerous, like racism, religion, or selfishness.  Dualism serves the purpose of helping us understand things in human terms.  But it&#8217;s vitally important to remember that when we are thinking dualistically, it&#8217;s only out of the necessity to break things down to our level, and NEVER a reflection of how reality actually functions.  Reality isn&#8217;t dualistic.  Reality is one.</p>
<p>Only use dualistic thinking in order to serve yourself.  Never enforce your arbitrary divisions on reality itself.  Reality doesn&#8217;t care about whether YOU think an experience is <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  So get over it, and start seeing the beautiful in the ugly, the love in the fear, and the supernatural in the natural.</p>

					<p>Hidden behind the idea of &#8220;practice&#8221; and &#8220;success&#8221; is this idea of separation.</p>
<p>If we want to become a great baseball player, then we clearly need practice.  Becoming a great baseball player takes some natural talent, but like other skills, it mostly takes dedication, training, and repetition.</p>
<p>A lot of times I will equate psychic abilities to other normal skills.  I might say that, just like becoming a great baseball player, if you want to learn to be psychic, then you need to practice it as if it were any other skill.  Don&#8217;t treat it special.  Don&#8217;t think of it as something mystical.  Treat it as if you were learning anything else.</p>
<p>I like this method of instruction for a lot of reasons.  The main reason I like to equate psychic abilities to other normal skills is because it breaks down the association between psychic abilities and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>It would be silly of me to be religious about playing baseball.  While some great baseball players are certainly religious, and some might even claim that their religion has helped them become so great - one thing is certain: You don&#8217;t learn to hit homeruns by closing your eyes and believing in some mystical force.  You hit homeruns by practicing.  Maybe religion plays a role in motivation, but the actual <em>skill</em> needs to be developed, and the only way to do that is to practice.</p>
<p>Likewise, when I talk about psychic abilities being like any other skill, my real goal is to break this mental association between psychic abilities and personal religious beliefs.  I might instruct someone to treat psychic abilities like any other skill, but what I&#8217;m really instructing them to do is to drop their insistence of explaining something unknown using religious ideas.</p>
<p>There is a slight problem with this though.  Psychic abilities <em>aren&#8217;t</em> like other normal skills.</p>
<p>Normal skills need to be learned.  The skill is external to yourself, and through training and practice, you slowly learn to perform the task correctly.  The information on how to perform the task is external to yourself.  Someone <em>else</em> created the game &#8220;baseball&#8221;.  You must learn what <em>they</em> created.  The information is inherently external.</p>
<p>Psychic abilities are not external.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.  This is where the analogy breaks down.  At this point, psychic abilities are not like any other skill.  They are not something created by someone <em>else</em>, that we must learn the rules to.  They are inside ourselves, at this very moment.  We are psychic creatures - right now.</p>
<p>We are not all baseball-playing creatures right now.  Some of us learn to play baseball, others don&#8217;t.  But we are ALL psychic creatures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to think of psychic abilities like any other skill in order to break our addiction of explaining unknown things using religion.  However: once that addiction is correctly broken, we must deal with the reality of the situation.  Psychic abilities are not like other skills.  Normal skills are external to ourselves - something that we must engage with the world around us to learn.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.</p>
<p>Put another way: a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest baseball player of all time, must at some point learn the rules of baseball.  But a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest psychic of all time, doesn&#8217;t have to learn anything.  In fact, they may already BE the greatest psychic at the moment they are born.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself looking externally for answers on &#8220;how to be an awesome psychic&#8221;, remember that you are psychic right now - it is something inside of you at this very moment.  The real question is at what depth do you understand your own true nature.</p>

					<p>Alright, time to cast your precognitive vote.</p>
<p>Use precognition, or just follow your gut, and predict who will win the Democratic and Republican nominations, who the nominations will choose as their Vice President, and who will win the White House.</p>
<p>As an example, I will give my prediction.  I believe Obama will get the Democratic nomination.  I believe he will choose Edwards as his Vice President.  I believe Romney will get the Republican nomination.  I don&#8217;t know who Romney will choose for his Vice President.  And in November, I believe Obama/Edwards will win the Presidency.</p>
<p>Remember - this is not what you <em>want</em> to happen - this is what you <em>predict</em> will happen.  Optionally, describe the process you used to get these predictions.  For me, I used a combination of my knowledge of the races, and my general &#8220;feel&#8221; for what&#8217;s going to happen.  Post your results in the comments.  The people who get it right will have bragging rights for four years, until the next bid for the White House :-P.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that there seems to be a large population of people who have attempted to learn and acquire psychic abilities, but have only achieved limited results.  Maybe the results were a little cool, but overall, it wasn&#8217;t impressive or notable.</p>
<p>The question comes down to: what is the difference between someone with substantial achievements in their psychic pursuits, and another who simply has mediocre results?</p>
<p>Before I attempt to answer this question, let me make one thing clear: I don&#8217;t know the answer :-).  I do not know how psychic abilities work, nor do I know the formula for success.  What I <em>can</em> offer is my perspective and experiences.  I believe I&#8217;m one of the many who has had notable results, and I think I might be able to help those that think they&#8217;re stuck at a mediocre level.</p>
<h3>A Solid Base</h3>
<p>First, let&#8217;s do some house cleaning.  Priorities and overall goals are a large factor here.</p>
<p>You will probably be stuck at mediocre results if:</p>
<p>1. You want to develop psychic abilities because you&#8217;re bored, and it sounds cool.  (Because you will only put in enough effort to cure your boredom).</p>
<p>2. You don&#8217;t actually practice, but you just like hanging out with weird folks online.  (Because achieving results usually takes some effort, like learning any other skill).</p>
<p>3. You want to beat up someone at school with your awesome mind-control skillz.  (Because your maturity will grow faster than your abilities&#8230; I hope).</p>
<p>4. You want to do something you saw in the movies.  (Because movies are fictional, and at best are exaggerations of reality).</p>
<p>5. You want immediate results.  (Because learning a new skill takes time, no matter what that skill is).</p>
<p>Those are pretty obvious, and I hope that if you&#8217;re reading this, you don&#8217;t seriously fall into one of the categories above.  If you do, then that&#8217;s no big deal - but don&#8217;t get bummed out when you don&#8217;t have the results you were expecting.  Becoming proficient in psychic abilities is just like any other skill, like playing the piano, or learning to speak a new language.  It takes effort.  The more effort you put in, the better results you&#8217;ll get (in general).</p>
<p>What are some good goals to have?  Well, I learn and practice my psychic abilities because I am fascinated by reality and truth.  I love doing things that others think is impossible, especially if at one time I thought it was impossible myself.  It&#8217;s about outgrowing an old mindset, and stepping into a bigger world.  This goal has allowed me to stay focused and motivated for a long time.  I didn&#8217;t choose or design this goal consciously - it&#8217;s something that I feel inside of me that keeps me going automatically.   If you ask some other people who have developed their psychic abilities quite a bit, you&#8217;ll likely find they have much more deeper goals than just doing something cool.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - psychic abilities are totally cool!  But that&#8217;s not the prime motivating facility.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Listen to Anyone</h3>
<p>No one knows how psychic abilities function.  NO ONE.  Including myself.  So don&#8217;t listen to us.  If someone starts preaching some &#8220;truth&#8221; to you, don&#8217;t treat it as gospel.  My ego is flattered when people follow my instructions religiously, but ultimately - it&#8217;s not healthy.  And it will lead to failure.  If you are a follower, then you will probably be stuck at mediocre results.  You will only consume whatever small successes the leaders have achieved.  If you want to step it up, then you need to lead yourself.</p>
<p>There are phases that one should go through.  Usually, when you first learn about psychic abilities, it&#8217;s a whole new world of ideas.  At this stage, it&#8217;s highly encourage to read and take in a lot of ideas, information, and techniques.  The reason for this is so that you won&#8217;t ask annoyingly broad questions, like &#8220;how do I do telepathy?&#8221; or &#8220;any tips for psychokinesis?&#8221;  These questions make me irate :-).</p>
<p>After you have a solid foundation of ideas, and have practiced with the standard techniques for a little bit, you need to go into a new phase.  You need to switch modes from learning what others have done, to creating your own path.</p>
<p>If you want more results, you need to take personal responsibility for your results.  You need to be self-reliant, and do what makes sense to YOU.  Stop asking for help.  Stop looking for someone else to tell you what to do.  Think for yourself, come up with a plan, and do it!  Yes, sometimes you will fail.  That&#8217;s the price you have to pay for meaningful results.  You can either be stuck at mediocre, waiting around for everyone else to tell you what to do, or you can take charge and evolve your own understanding.</p>
<h3>Practice Correctly</h3>
<p>When you are just starting out, your practice routine should be exactly what the standard techniques tell you to do.  If step one says meditate - then meditate.  If step two says visualize - then visualize.</p>
<p>Once you finish with that phase and decide to start leading yourself, then you need to modify your practice.  Don&#8217;t do what the standard techniques tell you.  Modify the techniques, insert new steps, try entirely new approaches, experiment with different belief structures, skip steps, mix techniques, etc.  This is now the correct way to practice.</p>
<p>When starting out, the correct way to practice is very procedural, and step by step.  This will get you the mediocre results, which serve as a great start.  But when it&#8217;s time to move on, then you need to start using your creative mind, and try new things without asking for permission.</p>
<h3>Be Open Minded</h3>
<p>Lastly, you absolutely must be open minded.  This does not mean gullible.  Being open minded simply means that when someone comes to you with a new idea, then take it in and digest it.  Have respect for the person who is presenting this idea to you - clearly they must believe in it to some degree, so even if it sounds insane from your perspective, it is very real from their perspective.</p>
<p>The reason this is important is because of the axiom of this article: no one knows how psychic abilities function.  Never treat anything as gospel, and never outright dismiss someone else&#8217;s perspective.  There is a happy middle-ground, where ideas are treated as ideas, nothing more, nothing less.  Truth can be evasive, so you must always stay alert.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, there is a certain mindset that a lot of successful psychics have.  Meaningful goals, independent thought, and open mindedness has shown itself to be stronger than any individual technique.  Why do you think experienced psychics argue over techniques?  Because we usually create them ourselves, over a long time of trial and error, and feel a strong sense of pride and ownership for them :-).

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My understanding of intention manifestation (IM) has evolved quite a lot over the years.  Ironically, my current understanding of IM has come full circle, and is now the same understanding I had when I first began experimenting with it, at age 16.</p>
<p>When I was 16, we didn&#8217;t call it &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; - we called it transmitting.  The idea was to broadcast a telepathic intent to the universal unconscious.  I&#8217;m not sure where the term &#8220;transmission&#8221; came from - perhaps Rainsong or Myriad came up with it.  Or maybe they just taught me the term, and it was coined by someone else.  Either way, that was my original understanding of the skill: as a telepathic broadcast.  But since the term &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; has become somewhat mainstream, I&#8217;ll continue to use that, since I do believe it is the same skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal unconscious&#8221; comes from Carl Jung (also known as the &#8220;collective unconscious&#8221;, or &#8220;objective psyche&#8221;).  The idea - as I understand it - is that we all share a common unconscious mind.  From this common mind, our conscious minds are just a small part sticking out.  Think of it like a big ocean - the waves are our conscious minds, which perceive from our location to be independent and separate.  But in reality, we are connected by a huge mass of common unconsciousness beneath us.</p>
<p>With this model, we can see how telepathy could be explained (in general).  Since we are all connected on an unconscious level, all we need to do is build a link between two extensions of consciousness (aka &#8220;people&#8221;), and communication will be the same as thinking to ourselves.</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven&#8217;t confused you too much.  It&#8217;s harder to explain than it is to understand :-P.  Here&#8217;s a picture!</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.png" title="Zen Ocean"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.thumbnail.png" alt="Zen Ocean" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(Click)</p>
<p></a></p>
<p>Either way, a transmission (or intention), is basically broadcasting out a thought on the entire universal unconscious.  Impressing the common mind with a thought.  Burning an image into the collective brain.  Once this broadcast has happened, then all conscious beings will receive it via intuition and gut feelings, of something they should act on.  That&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>Now why is this important?  Well&#8230; in the mainstream version of intention manifestation, you basically get whatever you want.  You just visualize it, and POOF!  It appears randomly some day!  This is incorrect, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If intention manifestation is limited by the ideas presented above, then really the only way intention manifestation can affect reality is by altering everyone&#8217;s collective intuition.  To do such a thing would be extremely useful for certain goals!  For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a lover, then by broadcasting your intent, all humans will unconsciously see that you are looking for a lover, and it will attract some people to you also looking for love.  If you&#8217;re looking for a business, or advice, or a parking spot, or anything where telepathy can serve you - then intention manifestation will be useful.  (Intending a parking spot could be telepathically telling people to hurry up and get in their car so they&#8217;ll leave in time for you to take their spot.)</p>
<p>However: if intention manifestation is a telepathic broadcast, then there are certain things it wouldn&#8217;t be useful for.  Mainly things that can&#8217;t be affected by an intuitive human.  Like the lottery.</p>
<p>With the lottery, I could be the best telepath in the world, but that won&#8217;t affect the lottery balls.  They aren&#8217;t conscious (right?!).  The procedure for drawing lottery balls is designed to remove the human element from the equation.  Which means I can visualize all I want, and I can scream my intention out to the unconscious all I want - but no one can do anything about it.  No one can help me.  No one can come to my rescue.</p>
<p>So - it is my belief that you can not win the lottery using intention manifestation.  And my results confirm this.</p>
<p>However, all is obviously not lost :-).  There must be some metaphysical way to win the lottery, because I still can&#8217;t explain how people win the lottery twice, and I can&#8217;t explain my own results with the lottery.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I should have taken the advice of a friend when I first dreamed up this goal.  He told me that I either have to predict the lottery numbers (via ESP), or manipulate the lottery numbers (via micro-PK).  Or maybe a combination of both.  Either way - I have to pick at least one or the other.  I theorized I had some more options - mainly intention manifestation and altering my beliefs about reality.  However, as we see, these are dead ends for the lottery.</p>
<p>So, I have a choice.  Either I can try to predict the lottery numbers, or I can affect the lottery numbers to a pre-determined set.  I have a long history of predicting the future, reading people, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that haven&#8217;t happened, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that I don&#8217;t know, and basically be bored with reality&#8217;s linear nature.  I also have a history of frustrating and unimpressive PK results.  Well gee whiz.  What should I do? <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Prediction it is!</p>
<p>It should be noted that I don&#8217;t know how I won the MegaMillions back in March.  I don&#8217;t remember if it was by prediction, or some other means.  I do know it happened right after I had the breakthrough in realizing that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; but that&#8217;s all I associate with those wins.  So I don&#8217;t know if ESP has helped me in the past with MegaMillions.</p>
<p>However, my luck with the scratch off tickets may very well have been from ESP.  When I first decided to go on my road trip to buy winning lottery tickets, I actually got a flash of the map I would end up driving before starting the trip.  I didn&#8217;t record it at the time because I was trying to focus on intention manifestation - not ESP :-P.  I didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by using ESP :-P.</p>
<p>And finally, before I end this post, I should also note that I tried to win the lottery using Remote Viewing in the past, and failed.  I did this when I was around 20 years old, and the reason I believe I failed was because of lack of skill, incorrect technique, and bad experiment design.  But hey, it was my first one, so I can&#8217;t be too hard on myself :-P.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s game time though :-P.  I&#8217;m 200x more sensitive and accurate now compared to where I was 4 years ago.  If I didn&#8217;t already know I would be correct, I would amaze myself :-P.</p>
<p>Also: if you saw my last post, then you saw my sweet ass lottery machine.  It&#8217;s in development, and not completed yet.  I shall be posting more videos as I build it.  It&#8217;s gonna kick ass :-).  Oh goodie&#8230;</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>With perception abilities, like empathy (perceiving emotions), telepathy (perceiving thoughts), communicating with your subconscious (perceiving internal messages), or remote viewing (perceiving foreign locations) - the question almost always arises: How do you know what you&#8217;re perceiving is real?</p>
<p>How do you know you&#8217;re perceiving someone&#8217;s emotions correctly and not just making it up?  Their thoughts?  How do you know that when you communicate with your subconscious, that you&#8217;re actually accomplishing something?  How do you know you&#8217;re actually perceiving something accurately?</p>
<p>For certain situations, it&#8217;s pretty easy to test.  If you&#8217;re remote viewing a location, and you want to know how well you did, then go to the location and check it out.  Or if your friend is trying to telepathically send you an image, then look at the image afterwards and see how close you got.  Easy :-).</p>
<p>However, with a lot of &#8220;real world&#8221; applications, it becomes a lot harder.  If I read someone&#8217;s emotions, how can I tell that I&#8217;m really doing it?  If I&#8217;m reading a complete stranger, then it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going to ask them afterwards how close I got.  Or even reading friends - it can be pretty awkward to approach them and ask, &#8220;are you feeling confusion over whether you should continue your relationship, or call it quits?&#8221;  So how do I know that I&#8217;m reading someone accurately?</p>
<p>Or if I&#8217;m communicating with my subconscious&#8230; how can I honestly tell that what I&#8217;m receiving is accurate?  How can I tell it isn&#8217;t just my imagination?  I mean - it IS all in my head - by definition!  A challenging situation.</p>
<p>The answer is: I don&#8217;t know, especially at first.</p>
<p>As a follow up question: if I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m doing it correctly, how do I even know if I&#8217;m doing anything at all?  Maybe I&#8217;m just psychotic?  I mean&#8230; if I can&#8217;t know whether what I&#8217;m doing is real, then it&#8217;s pointless.</p>
<p>My response is: Well, that&#8217;s fair&#8230; at first.  Keep your skepticism on high when you first start - I completely agree.</p>
<p>However :-).  We can be smart about things.  We can stay flexible, be skeptical, but still play along and see what happens.  And that&#8217;s the attitude I encourage.  Be skeptical - but don&#8217;t let that skepticism turn into cynicism.  Keep trying new things, keep experimenting and having fun, keep doubting and questioning.</p>
<p>If you maintain this attitude of having an open, playful, and skeptical mind, then you will succeed.  If you turn off your skepticism, then it&#8217;s possible that you will delude yourself at some point.  So skepticism serves us well.  If you turn off your open mindedness, then the skepticism will overtake you and you&#8217;ll develop cynicism.  With this attitude, it&#8217;s very possible you&#8217;ll do something amazing, but completely ignore it.  So open mindedness is very important too.  Therefore, the goal is to maintain a healthy balance between the two extremes.  The middle path.</p>
<p>Let me relate to you what has happened to me over the years.  I first started getting into empathy and communicating with my subconscious back when I was 17 years old (I&#8217;m now 24).  I can remember feeling unsure of whether it was working at all.  I can remember specific situations where my subconscious told me something that wasn&#8217;t true, and I questioned if I was wasting my time completely.  Did my subconscious actually not know?  Or was it my fault - and I was bad at communicating?  Or was I just crazy?  I really didn&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>I would go a few weeks, attempting to communicate, and eventually getting pissed and giving up for another few weeks.  Then a day would come by where I would think out of the blue, &#8220;Man, I haven&#8217;t really tried talking to my subconscious in a while&#8230; I should really start doing that again.&#8221;  So I would give it another shot.  Over time, I gradually became more and more confident, and the messages started getting more and more clear.  I&#8217;m at the point right now where I can clearly distinguish between my own thoughts, and the messages from my subconscious mind.  I can easy dictate a conversation, with close to zero effort.</p>
<p>At this point, how do I know that it&#8217;s real?  I just know.  I&#8217;ve developed a feel for it.  It&#8217;s sort of like asking a baseball player: how do you know when to swing the bat?  Well&#8230; they just know.  They don&#8217;t have a formula in their head&#8230; it&#8217;s a feeling they&#8217;ve developed over time.  They know.  The same is true for me at this point.</p>
<p>With the subconscious, my confidence slowly grew over time.  However, with empathy, my confidence was pretty high at the beginning.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone is naturally empathetic, and it&#8217;s inside all of us&#8230; it&#8217;s just a matter of tapping into the right feeling, and then developing it to be more accurate and specific.  Sort of like hearing.  We all hear.  But musicians will develop their hearing to the point of picking out certain notes and frequencies, different layers and instruments.  We all have a natural empathetic sense - and if we exercise it, we can become much more accurate with it, extracting emotions and watching them interact with each other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been confident of my empathic ability, because I can just see it.  I honestly can&#8217;t think of a time when I read a situation incorrectly.  Like I said - with empathy, it&#8217;s something we all have.  Even when I was bad at empathy, I still read things correctly - I just read them with less detail, and couldn&#8217;t piece it together as well.</p>
<p>How do I know when I read something if I&#8217;m correct?  Well, I make predictions based on what I read.  For example, if I read that a girl is starting to think sweet thoughts about me, then I will predict that she will attempt to ask me out on a date in the near future.  However, if I read that she isn&#8217;t the sort of girl to ask a guy out on a date, then I will predict that she will have her friends ask me about her, so she can get a feel of the situation.  And if I know that I&#8217;ll reject the idea of a date, then I can see how she&#8217;ll emotionally respond to this, and what her reaction will be.  I can see that she will reason that we just need to spend some time together in social situations&#8230; so I can see that she will attempt to set up social situations where we hang out.  And I can keep going further into the future, predicting my emotions, and sensing how she will react to them.  I can make an entire timeline for the next couple months.</p>
<p>Now - I see all of this about a week before it even begins.  How do I know how accurate my empathy is?  I watch and see how accurate my predictions become.  And if I have 100% accuracy, then I can be confident that my empathetic perception is real and accurate.</p>
<p>If I test my empathy with predictions every now and then, I can get a sense for how accurate it is.  Then when I read a situation that I can&#8217;t test, I can still be confident that my empathetic perception is correct.  I might not be able to test that specific situation, but why doubt it?  I&#8217;ve proven myself credible.  So I trust in my ability.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be a little hard to trust in these strange abilities at first.  So don&#8217;t.  Keep that skepticism high, but also keep an open mind.  Over time, things will start to add up, and you&#8217;ll develop the confidence through seeing the results.  It might not be 100% accurate, but if it&#8217;s accurate sometimes, and the accuracy keeps improving, and you can FEEL the improvement, then you&#8217;re on your way.  Eventually you&#8217;ll reach a point where you can be confident in your abilities, because you&#8217;ve proven them to yourself.  Until that time comes, have fun, and do your best :-).</p>

					<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>

This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />

<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>

<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>

<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean,</p>
<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>

<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I think about the nature of choice and free will quite a bit.</p>
<p>I already know that free will exists.  Philosophy majors can bite me :-P.  Free will exists because I see myself using it all the time.  I&#8217;m not going to get into a debate about determinism.</p>
<p>But how do we make decisions?  What is a decision?  Can we break it down to a chemical reaction in our brains?  Or a specific electric current flowing through the neurons in our noggins?  I believe we could find some things in my head that relate to my decisions, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the starting point of the decision.  The chemical reactions are simply side effects.</p>
<p>The only possibility I see is that decisions originate from the quantum world.  &#8220;Spritual&#8221; or whatever.  I don&#8217;t see any other option (of course, just because I don&#8217;t see it doesn&#8217;t mean another option doesn&#8217;t exist :-P).</p>
<p>Then I think: I think way too much!  Does this even matter?  I make decisions <em>all the time</em>.  I don&#8217;t need to know how it functions to use it.  Here it is&#8230; some mysterious decision making process.  Now what will I do with it?</p>
<p>Well, I want to win the lottery, and I believe that I can choose to win.  So how am I going to do that.  Hmm.</p>
<p>My brain tells me there are two angles for attack: 1. perceive the winning numbers (ESP), or 2. affect the drawing (Micro-PK).  However, my intuition says that there is a third option&#8230; and my intuition tells me that this third option is related to intention manifestation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the intuition some more&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t worry so much! :-)  Yes, intention manifestation is the starting point.  The brain fails you in this situation because ESP and Micro-PK are dependent on the idea that the observer is separate from the observed.  Intention manifestation is more correct because it uses the truth that we are all in the same pool of reality, interconnected.  Even if you don&#8217;t want to accept that, then look at the facts.  Remember that intention manifestation actually produced results in the past - ESP and Micro-PK didn&#8217;t come close.  Now, the intention manifestation model isn&#8217;t perfect&#8230; you&#8217;ve already torn it apart in previous posts.  But it is useful at this stage, and a step forward.  My recommendation is to start intending again.  Forget about all the theories, explanations, and thought-junk; Just Do It.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned how to make a training regiment and stick to it.  I&#8217;ve proven this with my physical training.  Perhaps it&#8217;s time to start exercising my ability to manifest as well.</p>
<p>Start low, increase slowly.  I&#8217;ll start today, intending to win the MegaMillions Jackpot, visualizing myself having the winning ticket.  I&#8217;ll focus on this for one minute without interruption.  And I&#8217;ll increase it by a minute every day.  By the end of September, I&#8217;ll be intending for over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan :-).</p>
