					<p>Here is an old story that I like to keep handy.  Every time I get in a discussion with a &#8220;skeptic&#8221;, they eventually use the line that &#8220;if psychic abilities were real, I would have seen it on the news&#8221;.  I like to give them this clip immediately afterwards :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m going to give you the best method to become telepathic.  This is a big secret, so please don&#8217;t tell anyone :-P.</p>
<p>The ability to read someone else&#8217;s mind is the same ability as reading your own mind.  To read someone else&#8217;s mind, you need to simply read your own.</p>
<p>Now this might not make sense at first.  You might argue, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid, I&#8217;m thinking about things all the time, yet I can&#8217;t read anyone else&#8217;s mind.&#8221;  Well, there is a difference between &#8220;thinking&#8221; and &#8220;reading your own mind&#8221;.</p>
<p>We all think.  Thinking is easy.  To read your own mind, it&#8217;s a question of: what are you thinking about right now?  And <strong>why</strong>?</p>
<p>The degree to which you can answer those questions correctly is the degree to which you are consciously telepathic.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t discount this idea.  I know it might seem simple on the surface.  But it&#8217;s actually much more difficult than you might originally think.  What are you thinking about right now?  Have you ever looked?</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m thinking about 100,000 different things, all at once.  And so are you.  What we&#8217;re immediately aware of is just scratching the surface.  I&#8217;m thinking about my family, my job, females, food, money, the future, the past, my possessions, the time, my toe, this post&#8230; I&#8217;m planning, organizing, digging, covering up, learning, teaching, breathing, slouching.  In an instant.</p>
<p>This is what meditation is all about.  Or at least - one aspect of meditation.  Sit down and look inside your own head.  Look at what you&#8217;re thinking about.  Trace it back.  Why are you thinking about that?  What is it connected to?  What sparked your current train of thought?  And what sparked the spark?  Can you keep your mind quiet?  Can you stop all thought?  Probably not for long - so why not?  What thoughts arise to fill the void?</p>
<p>After doing this for a long time, you start to get a hang for how your mind works.  The surprising thing is that everyones mind is exactly the same.  The people you hate and the people you love are all using the same mind.  It&#8217;s the very mind that you use.  It&#8217;s my mind as well.</p>
<p>Practice this if telepathy interests you.  You&#8217;ll begin to see other people think inside your own mind.  You&#8217;ll see their eyes, and your thoughts will be their thoughts.  You&#8217;ll start seeing the future.  Not because you&#8217;re &#8220;psychic&#8221; or anything like that - simply because you are aware.</p>
<p>On the down side, reality can become boring when you know what&#8217;s going to happen.  It&#8217;s like watching a movie in slow motion.  Seeing a sentence form in someone&#8217;s mind, only to hear them start to speak it; waiting patiently for them to finish what you&#8217;ve already seen.  Doing something before you&#8217;re &#8220;suppose&#8221; to do it.  Throwing off the natural order of events, and confusing people.  Becoming offended by people&#8217;s thoughts, and them having no clue why you&#8217;re so pissed off at them.  Becoming annoyed before an annoying person starts to annoy you - and then becoming even more annoyed when they do exactly what you knew they were going to do :-P.</p>
<p>On the plus side, there is a lot less worry.  If something fails, you see it fail before it does&#8230; and you may see it succeed even further down the line.  While everyone else is coming to terms with the failure, you already see the solution manifesting in the future, so it&#8217;s easy to stay positive.  Now you just have to wait around for the present to catch up :-P.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jesse just e-mailed me the following news article: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19875410/site/newsweek/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19875410/site/newsweek/</a></p>
<p>Happy reading :-).</p>

					<p>In light of dealing with skeptics on <a href="http://ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=392022">ld4all.com</a>&#8217;s message boards, I will offer multiple ways to prove psychic abilities are real.  There are two main paths: do the research, or experience the phenomenon.  Feel free to do both at the same time for double the proof.</p>
<h3>Do the Research</h3>

<p>The links and books above give more than enough proof.  How many of you searching for proof will actually read any of it though?  The information is usually pretty dry, I admit.  Nonetheless, if you really want that scientific proof - there you go. It&#8217;s all at your fingertips.  The only thing holding you back is your ability to read.</p>
<h3>Experience the Phenomenon</h3>
<p>The path that I personally enjoy is to experience the phenomenon directly.  You can&#8217;t really argue with personal experience!  Oh sure, after you have a bunch of weird experiences, people will look at you differently.  Some will call you crazy, and tell you what you experienced was simply impossible.  Some will treat you like a circus animal, asking you to perform on cue for their personal amusement.  Some will say you&#8217;re a liar, and that you&#8217;re trying to deceive people for profit.  But hey - if you really want that proof - you&#8217;ll need to make some sacrifices.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There you go.  There&#8217;s your proof.  Everything you need - right there.  A lot of the information is free on the web.  Purchasing books does cost some money, but surely it&#8217;s not that much.  Maybe $10 per book.  If you&#8217;re going to invest in only one book, my personal favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Psychic-Free-Method/dp/0684857049/ref=sr_1_1/105-7809629-6052428?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184948230&amp;sr=8-1">You Are Psychic!</a>, by Pete A. Sanders.  It gives a lot of great exercises to try and has a nice explanation for how psychic phenomenon might work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that hard to prove psychic abilities are real.  The actual work involved isn&#8217;t that much.  Mainly it consists of reading.  If you decide to try some exercises, they aren&#8217;t difficult either.  What usually happens is that people refuse to do the research because they&#8217;re lazy, or they refuse to try an exercise because they feel silly.  Then they proclaim that psychic abilities can&#8217;t exist because they&#8217;ve never seen proof.  Well no duh.</p>
<p>One last thing: This is by no means an exhaustive list.  Use Google.  Search.  Go to a library.  Actually GO TO A LIBRARY.  I spent countless hours at the University of Georgia&#8217;s library, reading random books on psi research.  The main keywords to look for are &#8220;telepathy&#8221;, &#8220;clairvoyance&#8221;, &#8220;esp&#8221;, and &#8220;psychokinesis&#8221;.  Searching for other terms doesn&#8217;t usually produce results.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>EDIT: In other news&#8230; I lost this round.  I hate losing.  I mean&#8230; sure, I only lost $1, so it&#8217;s no big deal.  But it pisses me off.</p>
<p>I got zero numbers correct.</p>
<p>Why does this piss me off?  Because I know I can win.  I know I can.  But I can&#8217;t reconcile the fact that I&#8217;m losing.  I mean, if I look at the numbers, I&#8217;m winning overall.  I&#8217;m still making a profit over the months I&#8217;ve been playing, and I&#8217;m shattering the mathematical odds.  Blah blah blah.  No jackpot though.  Profit is nice, but it&#8217;s not my goal.  My goal is the jackpot.</p>
<p>I am going to win.  Each loss adds energy to my win.</p>
<p>Bloody hell.  I know exactly how I&#8217;m going to go about it as well.  I know <em>exactly</em> where I&#8217;m making my &#8220;mistake&#8221;, if you want to call it that.  The solution is murky, but the &#8220;mistake&#8221; is clear as day.</p>
<p>If they can do it, I can do it.  If I can do it, then I will do it.  Simple as that.</p>

					<p>How do I use my own psychic skills in my daily life?  Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that everyone is psychic.  We use our psychic abilities all the time.</p>
<p>The second thing to realize is that when we use our psychic abilities, we don&#8217;t go out of our way to do it.  It&#8217;s part of our thinking process, and happens in harmony with our other normal functions - like memory, emotion, associations, etc.</p>
<p>We have to sort of step outside of societies limiting ideas, and look at reality.  Reality doesn&#8217;t distinguish between a psychic skill, and some other mental skill.  It&#8217;s all where you want to be, doing what you want to do.  Reality doesn&#8217;t monitor your mind, saying, &#8220;Oh, now Sean is using a psychic skill&#8230; cool&#8221;.  It&#8217;s just me being me.  And you being you.  It&#8217;s natural.</p>
<p>Even saying that some function is a &#8220;psychic ability&#8221; is a little incorrect.  I mean - what if I ask you, &#8220;When did you use your memory today?&#8221;  How do you answer that question?  Well, first you have to use your memory to think back on today&#8230; so there&#8217;s one :-P.  Then you might think of conversations you had with people, and think back to a point in that conversation when you used your memory&#8230; which is pretty much every 3 seconds :-P.  It&#8217;s just as hard to answer, &#8220;When did you use your psychic abilities today?&#8221;  Every 3 seconds I use them, in whatever way my mind needs at the moment.</p>
<p>For example, when writing the beginning of this post, I instinctively asked my subconscious how to phrase certain parts, and asked for clarification on ideas.  Before I started writing, I asked my subconscious if I should write a post today, and also checked the date of my last post.  Then I remembered reading a comment asking about how I use my subconscious on a daily basis.  I debated whether writing this post, then decided to start, partly because I felt confident that my subconscious would help me if I ran into trouble explaining something.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m at work, and reading a book.  There is a psychic function for reading a book, it almost feels like&#8230; it&#8217;s more than just reading over letters on a page - it&#8217;s a transfer of ideas and beliefs.  It&#8217;s a two-way conversation with the author.  If I want, I can see the author in front of me, explaining his or her ideas to me.  I can see them animated and excited during - what they feel - are the important parts.  I can ask questions, and get answers.  I can ask for clarification, or examples.</p>
<p>I can see the thoughts that led up to the authors point of view.  I can see how they think.  I can see the environment the author lives in.  I can see the difficulties they&#8217;ve experienced.  I can see the realizations they&#8217;ve attained, and the obstacles they&#8217;ve overcome.  Is this &#8220;psychic&#8221;?   Reality is one big blur - how do you draw a line in liquid?</p>
<p>Now - we can practice psychic abilities, and make them stronger and more accurate.  The same way we can exercise our memory, or muscles, or learn a song on guitar, or play chess.  Whatever you focus on gets stronger.  But you do need to realize that the distinction between one skill or another is just in your head.  Whatever your goals are, there is a cost in an amount of focus you need to spend to acquire them.  If you want to be a rock star, then you better spend a lot of your focus on playing guitar.  If you want to receive psychic information, then you better spend a lot of your focus on meditation and receptiveness.  If you want to acquire truth, then you better spend a lot of your focus on self-realization, and inward digging.</p>
<p>When people ask me how I use psychic abilities on a daily basis, these are where my thoughts go.</p>

					<p>Bahahaha.</p>
<p>Absolutely ridiculous :-).</p>
<p>So I walked to the store, needing to buy some batteries.  I brought $2 with me specifically because I wanted to play a scratch off lottery again, and win $100.  My subconscious told me I was going to lose, but I didn&#8217;t care.  I went.  Bought the batteries.  Bought the ticket.  And lost.</p>
<p>On my walk home, I was pissed.  I was talking to my subconscious, and declared (being rude, almost): if you know that I&#8217;m going to lose, then you know when I&#8217;m going to win.  Go FIND me a winning ticket, and I&#8217;ll drive to it!</p>
<p>So I grabbed my camera and documented my adventure.  I ended up filming about 60 minutes of footage, and trimmed it down to 10 minutes for YouTube.  Enjoy!</p>
<p>(I&#8217;d also like to note that I haven&#8217;t bought any lottery tickets <a href="../../../../2007/05/22/i-won/index.html">since my last winning</a>, so this isn&#8217;t a case of playing a whole lot to win a few times <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> - I&#8217;m making a profit).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A lot of psychic abilities fall into the category of perception.  Remote viewing, clairvoyance, talking to your subconscious, telepathy, empathy, etc.  Here&#8217;s one analogy that might help you in all your ESP endeavors.</p>
<p>Think of your mind and emotions as a pool of water.  Every thought you have creates a ripple in this pool of water.  Every emotion you conjure also makes ripples.  Any mental or emotional &#8220;movement&#8221; will create ripples, which can turn into giant waves if it&#8217;s strong enough.</p>
<p>Now, to perceive something psychically, you need to keep your pool of water absolutely still.  No splashing, no ripples, no swirling, no marco-polo :-P.  When you do this, your goal is to stop all thoughts, and keep your emotions still and passive.  You&#8217;re just holding still.</p>
<p>Hold that for a while, and see how long you can do that for.  If you can make it past a minute, with ZERO ripples, then you&#8217;re doing great.</p>
<p>Once you gain the skill to stop all ripples on command (and it does take some practice), then you&#8217;ll be ready to receive information psychically.  All you do is go stop all ripples, wait a second for everything to settle, and then announce one big wave of whatever your question is.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does my mother feel today?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once you make that announcement, then just sit back and calm your pool down.  Keep your mind and emotions still.  You&#8217;ll notice that new ripples will form on their own.  You&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s not YOU creating the ripples, because you are already confident you can keep a still pool from all your practicing earlier.</p>
<p>Decode these new ripples into thoughts and emotions.  Interpret them.  Figure out what these foreign ripples are saying to you.</p>
<p>If all goes well, this will be a reply to whatever question you asked.  If not - try again.  If you continue to fail after a long period of time, then you either need a new technique, or you need to work on keeping your pool still.  If you&#8217;re confused over whether the ripples are coming from your own thoughts, or somewhere else, then you need to practice keeping your pool still until you are confident that the ripples can&#8217;t be coming from you.</p>
<p>Try it out.  <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
