				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been focusing on OBEs lately.  I have equipment set up in my room, but I haven&#8217;t been able to get out of my body in order to experiment with it.  Instead, I&#8217;ve been having pretty amazing/insane lucid dreams.  Last night I slept about 10 hours, and just about all of it was lucid&#8230; it was so much fun :-).</p>
<p>Normally, it&#8217;s hard to remember dreams because they&#8217;re just blurry and fleeting.  Lately, my problem has been the opposite - I have so many unique and highly detailed experiences, that it&#8217;s too much to remember everything.  Waking life is incredibly repetitive, so it&#8217;s very easy to remember weeks of information, but dreams are individually unique moment to moment - one night can feel like the equivalent of five years of information.  It&#8217;s just too much :-).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been watching OBE videos on YouTube.  One awesome channel is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MonroeInstitute">http://www.youtube.com/user/MonroeInstitute</a></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve recently posted videos of seminars with Robert Monroe.  It&#8217;s very cool to see and hear him talk.  Check it out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also still working on getting a new project up and running, dedicated to researching paranormal phenomenon.  I have a lot of ideas, and I&#8217;ve talked with other folks who have great ideas too&#8230; so now it&#8217;s a matter of trying new things out, and documenting our progress.  I don&#8217;t expect to figure everything out in a month - this is more of a long term project - but I hope it eventually turns into a useful resource.  We shall see - I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The time has come&#8230;</p>
<p>ALW has served as an open meditation for me.  It has allowed me to express bizarre theories, test them against reality, share interesting information, and preach a little bit too.  It has been a nice corner for myself and a solid group of members to talk about weird stuff.  The members have shown patience in entertaining my thoughts, and expressed themselves honestly, whether to show agreement, or challenge my ideas on their merit alone, without special treatment.  For that, I am profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>But we know where this is going&#8230; it&#8217;s time for an upgrade in collective purpose.</p>
<p>I hereby announce my intention to organize and create a coalition of passionate individuals, focused on one primary goal:</p>
<p>Proof.</p>
<p>What does &#8220;proof&#8221; mean?  It means intelligent research into paranormal phenomenon, focused on collection of evidence (whether that evidence is in support of the phenomenon, or not).  If possible, this also means providing demonstrations (online, or in person), and/or instructions for reproducible experiments.</p>
<p>I am seeking volunteers willing to join me in leading this effort.  I only want serious, passionate leaders, who have a history of honest, intelligent, and open experimentation with the paranormal.  I also recommend the volunteer has a long history with a particular phenomenon they plan on investigating, in order to give them a good starting point.  I personally will be focusing primarily on out-of-body experiences (but may branch into other skills as well).</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that - while I definitely plan on having fun - this is a seirous venture.  You must be 18+ to volunteer as a leader.  As a leader, you will be held to high expectations.  With that said, I have a full-time job just like everyone else, so I don&#8217;t expect daily updates.  But I do expect progress to be made.</p>
<p>What can I offer volunteers?  1. A platform for posting results.  2. Equipment.  3. Research material.  4. Possibly further funding in the future.  5. A community of like-minded people, passionate about discovering truth.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this effort, feel free to ask in the comments, on the forum, or e-mail me directly (via the &#8220;Contact&#8221; button).  If you would like to volunteer, please contact me with your history, and what areas you would like to investigate.</p>
<p>I plan on creating a new site for this, but would first like to get a list of volunteers to discuss details with.</p>
<p>I ask my friends reading this that, even if you don&#8217;t want to volunteer, but know someone who might, please pass this invitation along to them.  Thank you!  More to come.</p>

<p>Enough of all this bullshit - it&#8217;s time to resume training!  I&#8217;ve resumed my OBE and EM training, and it feels good to <em>do</em> something :-).  I&#8217;ve decided to start holding weekly practice sessions with the geiger counter as well.  Every Sunday, at 7pm EST, feel free to meet in the <a href="../../geiger-game.php.html">geiger counter chat room</a>, and we can mess around collectively with the geiger counter.  I&#8217;ve added a timer to the page that counts down to the next practice session, so you know exactly when it will happen.</p>
<p>So, see you Sunday! <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Alrighty!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve updated the look of ALW, along with adding some forums!</p>
<p>The look badly needed an upgrade.  The old layout was made as a temporary placeholder, and was a little bland.  The new is similar, except it looks more bad ass, and has bigger buttons.</p>
<p>I decided to add the forums for two reasons.</p>
<p>1. Some people were using the Video Board as a forum, and just posted multiple replies to get their message across.  I figured that would happen, and didn&#8217;t attempt to prevent it, because communication is good :-P.</p>
<p>2. Forums create a wonderful community feeling, which I don&#8217;t think was really captured with the Video Board.  I had hoped people would post videos of themselves, but I learned just as everyone else did - it takes a lot of effort to make even a simple video.  And a lot of people really don&#8217;t want to broadcast themselves over the internet for everyone to see.  Fair enough :-).</p>
<p>I scripted the new forums from scratch, because I didn&#8217;t feel like hacking around bloated forum packages found online (compare my script, 1,100 lines of code, to SimpleMachines, with 59,000 lines of code).  I&#8217;ll be adding more features over time, and if you have any suggestions, just let me know.</p>
<p>Other than that, I hope everyone enjoys the updates!</p>

					<p>I was thinking&#8230;</p>
<p>I enjoy this site :-).  In my mind, it&#8217;s a success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad people are using the video board, and it&#8217;s fun to see what videos people post.  I always watch them and read the replies, though I don&#8217;t always reply.  The most requested feature seems to be an Edit button - I&#8217;ll probably add that soon.</p>
<p>The lottery game gets it&#8217;s fair share of use, though it&#8217;s dieing down a little bit.  I was using it as a &#8220;warm up&#8221; before picking numbers, but my current strategy strictly forbids any form of &#8220;warm up&#8221;, so I&#8217;m not using it as much right now.  Either way, I want to create more games for people to play with.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly what the games will be, but I like having the statistics viewable to the public, so everyone can see how each other are doing.  Maybe I&#8217;ll add a card game of some sort&#8230;</p>
<p>I enjoy the blog, but I do want to add some form of permanent content.  Not just a stream of consciousness from me :-P.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly how I want to accomplish this, or what permanent content I want to have, but the feeling is there :-).  I always read the comments and internalize peoples&#8217; questions and suggestions.  Adding a comment to the latest blog entry is a better way to ask questions than sending me an e-mail.  I have a hard time keeping up with my e-mail.</p>
<p>For December, ALW is averaging 390 unique visits/day.  Our peak was August at 455/day, and last month at 419/day.  We&#8217;ve been hovering around these values since June.  My goal is not to attract random people to the site, but I do like to attract intelligent people who have experience in the weird topics we discuss.  Eventually, I hope to attract people to the site who didn&#8217;t come here via PsiPog.net - not because I want to shy away from PsiPog.net, only because I want ALW to stand on it&#8217;s own feet.  <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/alittleweird.com">Alexa</a> ranks ALW at 1,325,716th most popular site on the web :-).  <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/psipog.net">PsiPog.net</a> is currently at 220,160th, by comparison.</p>
<p>I feel ALW now has an identity.  We have a solid chunk of content and unique features that defines what ALW is all about.  My next project will probably be to add another game or two, and then work on some non-blog content.  Maybe spruce up the design a little bit (that large blank area to the right of the logo is really annoying :-P).</p>
<p>A huge thank you goes out to everyone who is reading this right now :-).  I know a lot of people didn&#8217;t like the idea of archiving PsiPog.net, and creating ALW (I still get e-mails to this day about it) - but it was a big step up.  So thank you for reading the blogs, using the video board, and playing around with the lottery game.  And thanks of course for the honest feedback, which I always listen to :-).  I hope to expand ALW for the new year by adding creative and unique features to the site, and developing strong content.  Thanks again!</p>
<p>Also&#8230; if you didn&#8217;t notice, I updated the logo for the holiday season.  If the website has an orange banner at the top, then hit Refresh on your browser :-).</p>

					<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>
<p>http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/08/a-better-life/</p>
<p>Enjoy, if you haven&#8217;t already seen it.</p>
<p>-Fred</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Sean,<br />
This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/faq.aspx</p>
<p>Later,<br />
~Maila</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>

<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>
<p>in pychcology (a cource in our highschool),   our class tryed to learn to read these little cards with stars and circles on them and send them to each other telepathicly and the to best two people would do it together at the end of class in front of everyone. unforunately im not in my telepathic buddy&#8217;s class <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> but if i was we totaly would have stomped everyone into the ground and won.) anyways i just thought you&#8217;d find it pretty awsome that we actually got a chance to show off our telepathy skills in front of everyone in school.<br />
your friend,<br />
brad<br />
P.s. did you get arrested for graffitting that sign? lol</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean,</p>
<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there , i;m from poland and i read all of your articles day by day . YOU MAKE MY WORLD BETTER !<br />
thank You !</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank YOU!  And you&#8217;re welcome! <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;m honored to have helped in some way.

<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>So I just had an idea, which I think is pretty good.</p>
<p>Instead of forums, what if we had like a strictly video forum?  You post a video of yourself on YouTube, and then enter it on the forums here as a &#8220;new topic&#8221;.  People hit play, and see you either ask your question, or talk about something.  Then they reply with videos of themselves, in response.</p>
<p>I have no idea how it would turn out, but it sounds like a cool thing to try.  If you don&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m saying, just imagine a normal forum&#8230; Now remove all text in threads and posts, and replace it with videos.</p>
<p>I may just implement this&#8230; it&#8217;s fairly straight forward, and as long as YouTube handles the video side of things, it won&#8217;t cost any bandwidth either :-).</p>
<p>Would you (the reader) participate in such a forum?</p>

					<p>My dad had an idea for promoting A Little Weird, and wanted to turn it into a short video.  Somehow he convinced me to play along :-P.  I was skeptical at first, but I&#8217;m fairly pleased at the outcome now that we&#8217;ve finished.  That&#8217;s me in the video.  Please leave comments because my father wants to know what everyone thinks about it.</p>
