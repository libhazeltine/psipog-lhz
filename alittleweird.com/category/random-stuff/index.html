				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ah, 11/11&#8230;/11!</p>
<p>Surely I must have something important to share on this once-in-a-century date?!</p>
<p>No&#8230; not particularly :-P.  I can&#8217;t imagine too many people will end up reading this anyways, which is fine by me.</p>
<p>The only thing remotely psionics-related I&#8217;ve been doing is attempting to unwire my thoughts concerning empathy.  I discovered a term called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency" target="_blank">codependency</a>&#8220;, which does a great job at explaining the mental processes of (what I call) empathy.  If you find yourself a victim of empathy, perhaps researching codependency will help you.  It&#8217;s helped me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on archiving PsiPog and ALW to a single download of the appropriate HTML/CSS files.  I plan on putting this file on PsiPog.net, leaving it up for a year or two, then taking the site down completely.  We&#8217;ve had a good run&#8230; these websites were a big part of my teens and 20&#8217;s.  I&#8217;m 28 now&#8230; about to get married and start a family.  I&#8217;m glad to have helped a lot of people, but there comes a point when you have to move on. I hope to have the download available within the next couple months.</p>
<p>When I first started getting into the paranormal, when I was 15, my father told it me was just a phase.  I hated that.  I guess it&#8217;s something a parent tells themselves when their child gets into something weird, whether it be obnoxious music, or dressing a particular way, or trying to move things with their mind :-P.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a phase, but I don&#8217;t hate that it was a phase &#8212; I hated that &#8220;just a phase&#8221; was used to devalue my thoughts and feelings.  Oh, you believe something weird?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you are doing lots of research?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you&#8217;ve found scientific evidence?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  Oh, you&#8217;ve seen it with your own eyes?  You&#8217;ll get over it.  It&#8217;s this attitude of devaluing that I hate.</p>
<p>Psionics was a phase&#8230; a long phase :-P.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t valuable.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that it was all bullshit.  I have seen and done things that modern science cannot explain.  I feel proud of that.  It has helped me to deal with <em>being weird</em>&#8230; and finding other weird people in this world to relate to.  It&#8217;s pushed me towards self-growth and becoming a good person.</p>
<p>Everything is a phase&#8230; it just depends on the scale.  This human life is a phase we will all get over some day.  Psionics is what you make of it.  No one has the right to minimize something important to you.  That doesn&#8217;t mean you have the right to bully people with your beliefs either &#8212; it just means we should strive for mutual respect.</p>
<p>Happy 11/11/11!  Someday you will outgrow whatever it is you find valuable today.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t valuable today.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Not a whole lot going on right now&#8230; But I do manage to keep myself busy.  My current projects are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Win MegaMillions.  The jackpot is below $45 million, so I&#8217;m not playing right now.  My current strategy is to just pick numbers off the top of my head, with no overall understanding or strategy.  This is based on the idea that I&#8217;ll never fully know how it works, but I just have to trust that it will work.  I&#8217;m also working on my lottery machine, but since it&#8217;s construction won&#8217;t help my current strategy, it&#8217;s not a priority.</p>
<p>2. Video tape myself having an out of body experience.  I&#8217;ve started getting into the habit of training myself to OBE again.  I&#8217;ve noticed that my OBEs have dropped in frequency over the past months, and that bothers me.  So I&#8217;m resuming my training, and also video tape myself at the same time, with the idea that if I have an OBE during a training session, it will be on camera.</p>
<p>3.  I&#8217;m reading the book, <em>Science and the Akashic Field</em>, by Ervin Laszlo.  It&#8217;s interesting, but it really hasn&#8217;t captured my interest completely yet.  Perhaps in the later chapters it will do so.</p>
<p>4. Unrelated to the paranormal, I&#8217;ve been working a lot on another site of mine, <a href="http://codetank.com">codetank.com</a>.  It&#8217;s purpose is to teach programming, and provide a nice and fun environment to learn programming in.  I have a few games online, and it&#8217;s slowly growing.  Fun :-).</p>
<p>Nothing terribly exciting this moment, but maybe I&#8217;ll start seeing results with the lottery or start having some OBEs again.  I&#8217;m beginning to have consistent lucid dreams (I&#8217;ve had an LD every night for the past three or four days now), which is usually a sign that my training is having an effect.</p>

					<p>There is a disease in the psionic &#8220;movement&#8221;.   I&#8217;m sure this disease exists in nearly all groups of people, but it is particularly potent in the OEC.  The disease is: apathetic inactivity.</p>
<p>You can group psions into two groups: those who do things, and those who don&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m not being specific, because it really doesn&#8217;t have to get specific.  The question we need to ask ourselves, as individuals, is: Do I do anything to add to the collective knowledge of psionics?  Do I <em>do</em> anything?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about psionics here.  Not websites.  Not chat rooms.  Not forums.  Not blogs.  Psionics.  Psychic abilities.</p>
<p>Top 10 ways to <em>do</em> something:</p>
<p>1. Have a training regiment for a psionic ability.  And actually DO it.</p>
<p>2. Come up with ideas on how psionics might work.  And actually TEST your ideas with experiments.</p>
<p>3. Read a book about psychic abilities.  And actually READ it.</p>
<p>4. Read scientific documents about <em>real research</em> being done with psychic abilities.  And actually put effort towards UNDERSTANDING the material.</p>
<p>5. Practice.  But do so in a way that you can actually MEASURE your progress, so you can figure out if something is actually working or not.</p>
<p>6. Share your experiences with others.  And be HONEST, and reasonably critical of yourself.  Encourage others to be critical of your experiences.</p>
<p>7. Create VERIFIABLE scenarios.  Avoid situations where there can always be &#8220;a way out&#8221;.</p>
<p>8. Buy or participate in a professional psychic training program.  Then REPORT your results after following the instructions completely.</p>
<p>9. Go to a large public LIBRARY, perhaps taking a trip to a University, and look up the past experiments by parapsychologists.</p>
<p>10. TRY NEW THINGS.  Be pro-active.</p>
<p>I hate seeing so many smart people sit around and do nothing.  I hate seeing inactivity when there is so much that could be accomplished.  It&#8217;s not like psionics is closed book - it&#8217;s about the most open thing you can find.  Were not talking about Newtonian Physics, where everything has basically been figured out.  Were talking about a field where <em>any</em> individual can come by and revolutionize the entire paradigm!</p>
<p>I also hate seeing people fake doing things, or coming up with lame excuses, or being passive aggressive.  Do not create a website unless you actually have something of value to share.  Do not lie about your ability - <strong>period</strong>.  Do not talk about practicing - actually PRACTICE.  Do not write a 10-page post on your theory of psionics.  In fact - don&#8217;t write one page, unless you plan on actually TESTING it some way in the near future.  Theories are a dime a dozen.  Results, evidence, documentation of experiments - including failed ones - are the nuggets of gold.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t miss PsiPog.  I do miss the core of people who actually did things - they are more rare than I gave them credit.  But PsiPog as a whole suffered from the same disease as every other OEC&#8230; stagnation.  Either you&#8217;re moving forward, or you&#8217;re standing still.  <em>Do</em> something for psionics.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ah, November 11th.</p>
<p>Yes, it is Veterans Day.  But the numbers 11:11 have a paranormal meaning as well.</p>
<p>I was introduced to the ideas around 11:11 by a famous website, <a href="http://crystalinks.com/">CrystaLinks</a>.  You can find the 11:11 page <a href="http://crystalinks.com/11.11.html">here</a>.  The reason I first read it was simply because it&#8217;s the top article in the alphabetized index :-P.  Seemed like a good place to start learning about psychic abilities!</p>
<p>After I read the page, I started noticing 11:11 all around me.  I suppose it&#8217;s just a mental trick, where you subconsciously start to look for it, so you notice it all the time.  <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0481369/">The Number 23</a> might do the same thing :-P.  Luckily, I didn&#8217;t go insane, and start writing 11:11 all over everything in charcoal&#8230; yet. <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I could never really trust the stories around 11:11&#8230; I mean&#8230; DNA activation?  What does that even mean?  Numerology never really interested me, because I&#8217;m very good at math, and I knew that you could find all sorts of patterns in seemingly random places - just by looking around.  I didn&#8217;t really understand why one would trust one pattern over another&#8230; it&#8217;s just numbers.  They make patterns.  That&#8217;s what they do.  So I just threw all those ideas out the window.</p>
<p>But the subconscious seed had already been planted, and I kept seeing 11:11 everywhere, despite my rejection.  The more I tried not to see it, the more I saw it!  So I came to the conclusion that I might as well put it to good use&#8230; to this day, any time I see 11:11, I just tell myself, &#8220;You are psychic&#8221;.  So, for me, 11:11 represents a constant reminder that the world is a mystical place.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve re-read the CrystaLinks page today, it all seems insanely silly.  But oh well :-).  It&#8217;s still a cool idea, and I can&#8217;t wait until 2012 to see if all these crazy prophecies come true.  You never know.  It&#8217;ll be quite the event, no matter what happens :-).</p>
<p>Happy 11/11!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A lot of times it feels like I&#8217;m living in a story.  Like reality is just a play - a scripted sequence of events - and we all just play along.</p>
<p>When I talk to someone, I&#8217;m simply reading my lines.  And they return with their lines.  The dialog has already been created, and we simply walk through it.  Just acting it out.</p>
<p>Even the supposed &#8220;zany&#8221; or &#8220;random&#8221; people follow a predefined script.  They say the funny things they&#8217;re suppose to say, and everyone else laughs like we&#8217;re suppose to laugh.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do wonder whether life is deterministic or not&#8230; but I think just the fact that I&#8217;m contemplating such a thing proves that it&#8217;s not.  I don&#8217;t know about anyone else for sure, but I do know that I am aware.  I am aware of this moment.  I can cut right through it.</p>
<p>One thing that makes me curious is to think about my memory.  What am I working with?  What is in my head?  What is my earliest memory?  I mean&#8230; how did I get here?  When did I first become aware?</p>
<p>It seems like I should be able to scan back in my memory, and remember the moment when the I - the me - first arrived.  But instead it&#8217;s just a gradual blur.  Was it always like this?  Am I just in a state of perpetual amnesia?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>

This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />

<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>

<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>
<p>in pychcology (a cource in our highschool),   our class tryed to learn to read these little cards with stars and circles on them and send them to each other telepathicly and the to best two people would do it together at the end of class in front of everyone. unforunately im not in my telepathic buddy&#8217;s class <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> but if i was we totaly would have stomped everyone into the ground and won.) anyways i just thought you&#8217;d find it pretty awsome that we actually got a chance to show off our telepathy skills in front of everyone in school.<br />
your friend,<br />
brad<br />
P.s. did you get arrested for graffitting that sign? lol</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean,</p>
<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>This is the last post I&#8217;ll make about the lottery for a few weeks, I promise :-P.</p>
<p>My old intention was to simply win the lottery.  I told myself constantly that, &#8220;I am happy and grateful now that I&#8217;ve won the lottery.&#8221;  I visualized.  I got my emotions going.  I obsessed my mind with it.  All that stuff.  And I won.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s made me realize that I really don&#8217;t want to just &#8220;win the lottery&#8221;.  Sure, I&#8217;ve won a bunch of scratch off tickets, but that&#8217;s the end of the road.  What I really want now is to win the jackpot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve changed my intention to, &#8220;I am happy and grateful now that I&#8217;ve won the entire <a href="http://megamillions.com/">MegaMillions</a> Jackpot.&#8221;  This simple change has made me uninterested in playing scratch off tickets.  Which is the correct emotional response, according to my intention.</p>
<p>I have a rule that I won&#8217;t play MegaMillions unless the jackpot is $45 million or more.  I made this rule a few months back.  The reason being: if I win the jackpot, it&#8217;s going to really suck if I win the $12 million one, when on average the MegaMillions will pay out between $50 and $100 million.  So the rule was created not to play unless it&#8217;s $45 million or more.  Maybe you think I&#8217;m just being greedy now :-P.  But hey - I think it&#8217;s a smart choice.  Brand me any adjective you wish.</p>
<p>When someone wins the jackpot, it goes back down to $12 million, and slowly climbs it&#8217;s way up.  It takes about 2-2.5 weeks to reach the $45 million mark again.  So during this time period, I don&#8217;t play.</p>
<p>Now the kicker: <a href="http://megamillions.com/winningpicks/draw_details.asp?date=5/29/2007">someone won $44 million</a>.  I was pissed :-P.  I had waited patiently for 2.5 weeks to play again, waiting for it to get $45 mil or higher.  Someone wins right below the cut off point for me.  Back to ground zero.  Now I have to wait another 2.5 weeks.</p>
<p>Which is the reason why I won&#8217;t be posting about the lottery for a little while.  I&#8217;m not doing the scratch off anymore, and I&#8217;m not playing MegaMillions until it gets to $45 mil or higher.  Perhaps this will force me to talk about some new topics, and give the whole lottery thing a rest for at least a little while :-P.</p>
