				<div class="entry">
					<p>It&#8217;s been nearly 2 years, and I haven&#8217;t won the jackpot.  Therefore, I have failed my goal.  I told myself, in March of 2007, that if I didn&#8217;t win by March of 2009, then I must deal with the failure directly.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I have won some money, and have beaten the odds.  I can achieve some success&#8230; but not at the level I need to in order to win the jackpot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about it recently.  For me, it&#8217;s been a question of Meaning.  What is The Meaning of life, ya know?</p>
<p>A lot of people don&#8217;t really think about it&#8230; they pawn off the responsibility to some other person or book.  That&#8217;s bullshit.  Or, they conclude that they&#8217;ll never know, so stop thinking about it, and just move on.  I also disagree with this approach.</p>
<p>If I knew the Meaning, then I could work towards that Meaning.  For example, if the Meaning was to have babies&#8230; then I could just get married, have kids, and call it a day.  Or if the Meaning was to help people, then I could just join the Peace Corps, teach people stuff, and call it a day.  Or if the Meaning was to fight for freedom, then I could just become a Constitutional lawyer, run for public office, and call it a day :-).</p>
<p>The point is: how I answer the question of &#8220;Meaning&#8221; has a large impact on the decisions I make on a daily basis.  It determines what direction I work towards.  I&#8217;m willing!  Give me a Meaning, and I will work hard for it!  I&#8217;ve searched and searched, and all answers have failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You choose your own Meaning of life!&#8221;  Blah blah blah.  If I choose the meaning of life, then it isn&#8217;t the meaning of life, is it?  It&#8217;s the meaning of Sean&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>See, I&#8217;ve developed another thought.  Not only is there no meaning, but I think the entire premise is false.  It&#8217;s false to <em>need</em> meaning.  Instead of figuring out what the (non-existant) Meaning is, I should instead remove my need for a meaning.</p>
<p>What is meaning, anyways?  What does meaning mean? <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I get asked questions like, &#8220;I just had a really weird experience.  What does it mean?&#8221;  I never know how to answer those questions.  What does it mean?  What does it mean to you?  I can&#8217;t tell YOU what it means to YOU.  You tell me!</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think &#8220;meaning&#8221; is a bastardisation of &#8220;truth&#8221;.  When we ask for the meaning behind something, we are really asking for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  What does a car wreck mean?  Well, it means you were going 40 miles per hour, and ignored the red light.  Then, another driver who assumed you would stop at a red light, drove under their green light&#8230; upon which, you hit them, because the trajectory and timing of the vehicles put them in the same location, at the same point in time&#8230; which can&#8217;t happen&#8230; so instead, the cars rammed into each other.  The metal bent, in accordance to how metal bends, based on the atomic properties of the chemical bonds in the material.  Yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>There is no meaning outside of truth.  There is no meaning of life, because the premise - that life exists - is incorrect to begin with.  Sure, since we are human, we have human nature&#8230; which tells us to survive and reproduce.  But the truth is, that if all humans were wiped off the face of this Earth&#8230; no one would care.  There would be no one to care.  Just like no one cared when the dinosaurs went extinct.  The dinosaurs probably cared while it was happening&#8230; but they don&#8217;t care now.  The atoms that made up the dinosaurs are layered under the Earth, or are flowing in a river, or maybe inside of your body.  The very atoms that made up a ticeratops&#8217; lungs are now protein strands in your brain, storing your memory as an 11 year old.  And those protein strands couldn&#8217;t care less that they aren&#8217;t part of a tricertops anymore.</p>
<p>When we ask for the Meaning of life&#8230; the question is false, because the premise is that we are external to this world, looking into it through the lense of this human body.  When we ask for the Meaning of life, we presuppose a false identity.  The real question - the only question - is: Who Am I?  What is the one true identity?</p>
<p>So what the hell does this have to do with the lottery? <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The lottery was chosen as a vehicle through which to test life metaphors against the backdrop of reality - without relying on a human mind to give it meaning.  The lottery project&#8217;s question was: does meaning exist outside of the human mind?  The results responded: No.  Meaning is created in the mind afflicted with the disease of identity.  Meaning is not part of reality itself&#8230; it is a by-product of the human experience.</p>
<p>(As a side note, the observed phenomenon of <a href="../../2008/04/05/beliefs-reality-and-questions-galore/index.html">&#8220;deeper meaning&#8221;</a> is therefore a result of psychology and telepathy - theory #2 is correct.)</p>
<p>So: what is the meaning of life?  A good answer is: peace, love, freedom, etc.  A better answer is: whatever you choose for your own life.  The correct answer is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)">Mu</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Still, we are stuck.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s taken me about 18 months, but I&#8217;ve finally come full circle with my thoughts about the lottery&#8230;</p>
<p>When I first started trying to win the lottery, I believed that I needed to do so through some sort of understanding.  A lottery-nirvana.  This evolved into trying out different techniques related to consciousness.  Altering my belief structures, trancing, precognition, intention manifestation, etc.</p>
<p>As those techniques (mostly) failed, I began to think that science was the way to go.  Think of an experiment, go through the motion, and be done with it.  Plug and chug.  I had turned away from the consciousness-based approach, and thought a more mechanical way would work.  I looked at winning as a result of a series of successful experiments.</p>
<p>The problem with designing and executing experiments was finally realized and expressed in my post, <a href="../../2008/08/17/pseudoscience/index.html">Pseudoscience</a>.  The scientific method can only help us so much&#8230; but how do you turn a microscope on itself?</p>
<p>So I return to my first thoughts, with a more robust sense of direction.  There is no mechanical way to win the lottery; from a machine&#8217;s perspective, the lottery drawing is a chaotic process.  No amount of formulae can predict the future.  Our destination is a result of decision - not determinism.  The only way to win the lottery is to plug into a decision-making machine: Consciousness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still at a loss on how I&#8217;m going to do this&#8230; perhaps that&#8217;s why I continue to fail.  I&#8217;m trying to find the middle path.  I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed my results from the past 17 months, concerning the lottery.</p>
<p>I devised a way to measure how &#8220;close&#8221; I get to the winning numbers.  My formula for measuring this &#8220;closeness&#8221; is somewhat arbitrary, but there is no correct formula, so it works as good as any.  In calculating the odds, I measure the &#8220;closeness&#8221; of all possible tickets - then see how many tickets are just as &#8220;close&#8221; as my ticket.</p>
<p>For the curious programmers, you can see my C program for measuring &#8220;closeness&#8221; here: <a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2008/07/score_calc.c" title="Lottery Score Calculator">Lottery Score Calculator Source Code</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted three of my best results.  Of particular interest is the drawing that scored 1 in 1091.  The winning numbers were 04 17 26 46 56 [25], and I picked 06 18 29 44 52 [27].  So close! <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>As you can see, a lot of my drawings are crap.  But it&#8217;s those few gems that are so amazingly close, that it&#8217;s impossible to ignore.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I feel like such a sucker for thinking so much about the topic of winning the lottery, but I can&#8217;t help it - it embodies everything I care about, in a poetic sense.  Perhaps I just use it as an excuse to think about hard topics? ;-P</p>
<p>I was laying in bed, throwing my orange ball up at the ceiling, debating with myself about the morality of winning the lottery.  If I could find a way to win, would it be cheating?  What overall goal am I aiming for, and is this goal moral?  Am I just doing it because I want to escape the rat race of living paycheck to paycheck?  Or is there an honest and healthy reason for my obsession?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t lie to myself&#8230; I know that part of me desperately wants to transcend society&#8217;s dependence on money.  By winning the jackpot, I will essentially free myself from years of burden and conformity required by society in order to pay for the necessities of life.  But free myself to what end?  What would I do with my time, once liberated?</p>
<p>There is a divine balance to reality.  Any push away from truth creates a perfectly calculated, equal and opposite push towards truth.</p>
<p>If my theories are correct, then society has made a gamble against truth.  Society has taken the stance of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221;.  The lottery embodies this assumption by society.</p>
<p>But if the assumption is false - if things happen for a reason, and there is an underlying meaning in everything - then I should be able to win the lottery.  Not for the money - but for the point of demonstrating the falseness of society&#8217;s assumption.  After all, who am I to say that I am right, and society is wrong?  What evidence have I presented society with?  As far as society is concerned, I&#8217;m just a peebrain with a blog :-).</p>
<p>So, my goal is to demonstrate to society that the assumption of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221; is false.  Now maybe <em>I</em> am wrong - maybe society&#8217;s assumption is correct.  In which case, I won&#8217;t win the lottery, and my failed demonstration can be used as evidence that some things <em>are</em> random.  Of course, that&#8217;s not the outcome I believe will come to pass :-), but reality will be the judge of that.</p>
<p>Now - I believe that this goal is moral.  My goal is rooted in revealing truth - whether I&#8217;m correct or incorrect.  However, does this answer the question of what to do with the money, once I win?</p>
<p>Yes, I believe it does.  Now that I&#8217;ve defined my goal, and my goal is moral, I can more easily see what follows.</p>
<p>After demonstrating that society&#8217;s assumption is false, I must spend the money on discovering the truth.  It&#8217;s the only moral way to balance out the situation.  I can&#8217;t take advantage of society&#8217;s ignorance, then disappear with the money to lead a selfish life of abundance.  Once I win, it will become my responsibility to spend the money on restoring balance.</p>
<p>So, let it be known:</p>
<p>If I win the jackpot, then I will use the money to research the topic of both how society allows itself to become deceived, and what the truth actually is.  I will create an organization in order to accomplish this research.  I am announcing this because, in the event that I win, I want to ensure that everyone keeps me honest.  I am human, and I will definitely be tempted to just pack up my bags, and live a peaceful private life.  However, since I know that using society&#8217;s ignorance for my own personal gain is immoral, I want to declare my intention publicly.  I will do everything in my power to remain faithful to my word - but, if I start to flake out, then I hope those reading this proclamation will remind me of my obligation.</p>
<p>Oh boy :-P.</p>

					<p>I continue to have a strong belief that I can win the lottery&#8230; but I have yet to hit the jackpot (obviously).  It&#8217;s quite the enigma.</p>
<p>A lot of times I question, &#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m asking something from myself that is legitimately impossible?&#8221; - in which case, I&#8217;m putting myself under stress for no good reason.  But then I quickly remember my successes.</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> broken the mathematical odds&#8230; no matter which way you cut it.  And so have others.  But for the life of me, I can&#8217;t figure out what triggers it.</p>
<p>I have exhausted all the &#8220;normal&#8221; techniques that come to mind, with close to zero results: precognition, trancing, remote viewing, micro-psychokinesis, intention manifestation, &#8220;just do it&#8221;, asking my subconscious directly, asking dream characters, etc.  This has led me to try more crazy techniques.  As a result, I have found two techniques that consistently produce results (and also sound even more insane than the run-of-the-mill paranormal techniques):</p>
<p>The first technique is to ask my subconscious to list some &#8220;profound truths&#8221; - and in the middle of hearing these truths, ask for a number.  I believe this works because my subconscious has to &#8220;tune&#8221; into the truths, and while &#8220;tuned in&#8221;, I can ask for truths concerning the lottery.</p>
<p>The second technique is to video tape myself &#8220;praying&#8221; for the winning numbers.  Yes, this actually produces results for me. <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif' alt=':-|' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>And yes, I realize how bat-shit insane both techniques are (especially the second one, which has actually been more effective than the first).  But&#8230; those are the two that have worked out of all my ideas thus far.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve taken this idea of winning the lottery too far?  Naaa :-P.  Not yet :-).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to reconcile the seemingly contradicting experiences I&#8217;ve had.  Until I can come up with a unified theory, I must keep experimenting.  Besides, it&#8217;s fun :-).</p>

					<p>Ernesto e-mailed me a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of now, I have just finished reading your incomplete sequel to your first E-Book. It left me feeling empty as your new website does not talk about all of the &#8220;Psi&#8221; phenomenon discussed in your first. I wish you could publish a blog in which you finish expressing the ideas of your sequel. Do you still practice Telekinesis and Psi Balls? Do you have any new ideas about how they function with this new broader outlook?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why I don&#8217;t talk about some of my current beliefs is because they sound insane :-P.  Part of me would rather quietly hold on to my bizarre beliefs, and work on them in private, than to express them for everyone to read and criticize.  Keep in mind that a lot of my friends in real life and co-workers read this blog, and my name is attached to every post, so I feel an increased burden to tone things down :-P.</p>
<p>Another reason I don&#8217;t talk about my current understanding is because it&#8217;s not clear.  I don&#8217;t see it clearly in my mind, so I have a hard time explaining it.  I&#8217;ll start to write a sentence, but it won&#8217;t feel correct, so I&#8217;ll try again.  And again.  Ultimately, the problem is that I haven&#8217;t &#8220;figured it out&#8221; in my own head, so I won&#8217;t write about it.</p>
<p>But for this post - sure, I&#8217;ll give it a shot:</p>
<hr />
<p>The biggest belief that I struggle with is that it is my understanding that reality is a dream of some sort.  And I hate saying that because it&#8217;s very cliché, but I&#8217;ve yet to find any other explanation for what I&#8217;ve observed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined this belief in past posts: <a href="../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the things we experience in reality have deeper meaning.  Just like in dreams, where certain metaphors drive the experience, these same metaphors are also the driving forces for what we experience in reality.</p>
<p>The reason why I believe this is because I&#8217;ve been tracking it in my own life.  I have these experiences which are too bizarre to be labeled &#8220;coincidence&#8221;.  I see the metaphors, sometimes while the experience is happening, other times after the fact.  I can predict what&#8217;s going to happen by looking at what the metaphor requires.  A lot of the time I&#8217;m correct (though I will be honest, I am not 100% :-P).</p>
<p>Now of course, the same old arguments can be brought up, that I am biased because I&#8217;m looking for meaning, or that I&#8217;m a sucker, or whatever.  Those arguments don&#8217;t really bother me, because I know I am very honest with myself, and that no one is more critical of my own thoughts than me.  But, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, they do seem like legitimate complaints.  One reason I don&#8217;t like discussing my beliefs is because I&#8217;ll have to argue these worn out positions with people who don&#8217;t care as much as I do.  I&#8217;ve put years of blood sweat and tears into my current beliefs, constantly challenging them from every perspective I can think of, testing reality, forcing myself to drop incorrect beliefs (at the expense of my ego and pride), etc.  It&#8217;s very frustrating to argue with someone who is just trolling around because they have nothing better to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the question that I&#8217;ve yet to answer, is how deep do these metaphors go?  On the surface, it might seem like I&#8217;m just arguing in favor of basic psychology.  I&#8217;ve observed these metaphors manifesting themselves in reality - not just in my own head - so at a minimum I&#8217;m talking about something more than psychology.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m divided between three basic explanations:</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> Reality itself is governed by these metaphors.  Reality <em>is</em> a dream.  Science is derived from this dream.  Examples of this theory are cited in the above links: <a href="../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2.</strong> There is an underlying physical reality that is governed by science, but there is a mental reality governed by these metaphors that co-exists with this physical reality.  This would mean that the metaphors are a result of the mind, but that we see manifestations of these metaphors in reality because of large scale unconscious telepathy.  I talk about this idea here: <a href="../../2007/11/05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html">Current Understanding of Intention Manifestation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3.</strong> Something I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>If explanation #1 is correct, then reality is a free for all.  There are no rules.  Psionics, and all belief structures, are now easily explained.  This sounds a little outlandish, so I tend to side with #2.</p>
<p>If explanation #2 is correct, then there is a very large question.  How does this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  In this explanation, macro-psychokinesis is not explained.</p>
<p>Most likely, explanation #3 is correct.  But since I&#8217;ve yet to think of it, I don&#8217;t know how it works :-).</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the next question might be: how can we determine which is correct?  What would be a wonderful test that would clear a lot of this up?</p>
<p>Well, winning the lottery.</p>
<p>The lottery is void of mind.  If this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; exists, then the lottery would not be a part of it.  Therefore, intention manifestation wouldn&#8217;t work on the lottery (which is my experience).  So, according to my experiences so far, #2 looks like it might be correct.</p>
<p>However, the problem with #2 is the question of macro-psychokinesis - i.e., how does the &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  Is the physical reality deterministic?  Where does free-will fit into this?</p>
<p>If #2 was completely correct, then you couldn&#8217;t use psychic abilities to win the lottery.  Yet I have already succeeding in breaking the mathematical odds, and other psychics have won the lottery as well. See: <a href="../../2007/06/15/psychic-wins-lottery/index.html">Psychic Wins Lottery</a>, <a href="../../2007/05/22/i-won/index.html">I Won</a>, <a href="../../2007/05/27/i-won-again/index.html">I Won&#8230; Again</a>.</p>
<p>So, #1 doesn&#8217;t feel correct, and my experiences back it up because I failed to win the lottery using intention manifestation.</p>
<p>But, #2 is also incorrect to some extent, because I have succeeded a little bit in winning the lottery, and others have done better than I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, in conclusion&#8230;</p>
<p>In my last eBook, I talked about belief systems, and how we can succeed with psychic abilities using drastically different belief systems.  The question that I had at the end of that eBook was basically: how can that be?</p>
<p>My answer to that question is that reality is some form of dream.  I haven&#8217;t posted a lot on this subject because a lot of the revelations have been very personal as I inspect the metaphors driving my own life.</p>
<p>The next question is: to what extent do these metaphors affect reality?  Either reality <em>is</em> a dream, and physical reality is derived from that dream (#1), OR there is a physical reality, and a mental reality, each governed by different rules (#2).</p>
<p>Judging from my experiences, and my intuition, I believe that #2 is probably more correct.  However, then the question becomes: how is macro-psychokinesis possible?  I.e., how does the mental reality affect the physical reality?</p>
<p>At that point, a good test is to attempt to win the lottery (something completely physical), using mental means (psychic abilities).  This will get me lots of money, play into my own life metaphor, and help answer these glaring questions about how reality works.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Not a whole lot going on right now&#8230; But I do manage to keep myself busy.  My current projects are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Win MegaMillions.  The jackpot is below $45 million, so I&#8217;m not playing right now.  My current strategy is to just pick numbers off the top of my head, with no overall understanding or strategy.  This is based on the idea that I&#8217;ll never fully know how it works, but I just have to trust that it will work.  I&#8217;m also working on my lottery machine, but since it&#8217;s construction won&#8217;t help my current strategy, it&#8217;s not a priority.</p>
<p>2. Video tape myself having an out of body experience.  I&#8217;ve started getting into the habit of training myself to OBE again.  I&#8217;ve noticed that my OBEs have dropped in frequency over the past months, and that bothers me.  So I&#8217;m resuming my training, and also video tape myself at the same time, with the idea that if I have an OBE during a training session, it will be on camera.</p>
<p>3.  I&#8217;m reading the book, <em>Science and the Akashic Field</em>, by Ervin Laszlo.  It&#8217;s interesting, but it really hasn&#8217;t captured my interest completely yet.  Perhaps in the later chapters it will do so.</p>
<p>4. Unrelated to the paranormal, I&#8217;ve been working a lot on another site of mine, <a href="http://codetank.com">codetank.com</a>.  It&#8217;s purpose is to teach programming, and provide a nice and fun environment to learn programming in.  I have a few games online, and it&#8217;s slowly growing.  Fun :-).</p>
<p>Nothing terribly exciting this moment, but maybe I&#8217;ll start seeing results with the lottery or start having some OBEs again.  I&#8217;m beginning to have consistent lucid dreams (I&#8217;ve had an LD every night for the past three or four days now), which is usually a sign that my training is having an effect.</p>

<p class="postheader"><small class="postauth">November 5th, 2007 by <a href="../../index.html@author=2.html">Sean</a></small><span class="posttitle"><a href="../../2007/11/05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Current Understanding of I.M.">Current Understanding of I.M.</a></span></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My understanding of intention manifestation (IM) has evolved quite a lot over the years.  Ironically, my current understanding of IM has come full circle, and is now the same understanding I had when I first began experimenting with it, at age 16.</p>
<p>When I was 16, we didn&#8217;t call it &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; - we called it transmitting.  The idea was to broadcast a telepathic intent to the universal unconscious.  I&#8217;m not sure where the term &#8220;transmission&#8221; came from - perhaps Rainsong or Myriad came up with it.  Or maybe they just taught me the term, and it was coined by someone else.  Either way, that was my original understanding of the skill: as a telepathic broadcast.  But since the term &#8220;intention manifestation&#8221; has become somewhat mainstream, I&#8217;ll continue to use that, since I do believe it is the same skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal unconscious&#8221; comes from Carl Jung (also known as the &#8220;collective unconscious&#8221;, or &#8220;objective psyche&#8221;).  The idea - as I understand it - is that we all share a common unconscious mind.  From this common mind, our conscious minds are just a small part sticking out.  Think of it like a big ocean - the waves are our conscious minds, which perceive from our location to be independent and separate.  But in reality, we are connected by a huge mass of common unconsciousness beneath us.</p>
<p>With this model, we can see how telepathy could be explained (in general).  Since we are all connected on an unconscious level, all we need to do is build a link between two extensions of consciousness (aka &#8220;people&#8221;), and communication will be the same as thinking to ourselves.</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven&#8217;t confused you too much.  It&#8217;s harder to explain than it is to understand :-P.  Here&#8217;s a picture!</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.png" title="Zen Ocean"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/11/zen_ocean.thumbnail.png" alt="Zen Ocean" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(Click)</p>
<p></a></p>
<p>Either way, a transmission (or intention), is basically broadcasting out a thought on the entire universal unconscious.  Impressing the common mind with a thought.  Burning an image into the collective brain.  Once this broadcast has happened, then all conscious beings will receive it via intuition and gut feelings, of something they should act on.  That&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>Now why is this important?  Well&#8230; in the mainstream version of intention manifestation, you basically get whatever you want.  You just visualize it, and POOF!  It appears randomly some day!  This is incorrect, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If intention manifestation is limited by the ideas presented above, then really the only way intention manifestation can affect reality is by altering everyone&#8217;s collective intuition.  To do such a thing would be extremely useful for certain goals!  For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a lover, then by broadcasting your intent, all humans will unconsciously see that you are looking for a lover, and it will attract some people to you also looking for love.  If you&#8217;re looking for a business, or advice, or a parking spot, or anything where telepathy can serve you - then intention manifestation will be useful.  (Intending a parking spot could be telepathically telling people to hurry up and get in their car so they&#8217;ll leave in time for you to take their spot.)</p>
<p>However: if intention manifestation is a telepathic broadcast, then there are certain things it wouldn&#8217;t be useful for.  Mainly things that can&#8217;t be affected by an intuitive human.  Like the lottery.</p>
<p>With the lottery, I could be the best telepath in the world, but that won&#8217;t affect the lottery balls.  They aren&#8217;t conscious (right?!).  The procedure for drawing lottery balls is designed to remove the human element from the equation.  Which means I can visualize all I want, and I can scream my intention out to the unconscious all I want - but no one can do anything about it.  No one can help me.  No one can come to my rescue.</p>
<p>So - it is my belief that you can not win the lottery using intention manifestation.  And my results confirm this.</p>
<p>However, all is obviously not lost :-).  There must be some metaphysical way to win the lottery, because I still can&#8217;t explain how people win the lottery twice, and I can&#8217;t explain my own results with the lottery.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I should have taken the advice of a friend when I first dreamed up this goal.  He told me that I either have to predict the lottery numbers (via ESP), or manipulate the lottery numbers (via micro-PK).  Or maybe a combination of both.  Either way - I have to pick at least one or the other.  I theorized I had some more options - mainly intention manifestation and altering my beliefs about reality.  However, as we see, these are dead ends for the lottery.</p>
<p>So, I have a choice.  Either I can try to predict the lottery numbers, or I can affect the lottery numbers to a pre-determined set.  I have a long history of predicting the future, reading people, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that haven&#8217;t happened, &#8220;knowing&#8221; things that I don&#8217;t know, and basically be bored with reality&#8217;s linear nature.  I also have a history of frustrating and unimpressive PK results.  Well gee whiz.  What should I do? <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Prediction it is!</p>
<p>It should be noted that I don&#8217;t know how I won the MegaMillions back in March.  I don&#8217;t remember if it was by prediction, or some other means.  I do know it happened right after I had the breakthrough in realizing that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; but that&#8217;s all I associate with those wins.  So I don&#8217;t know if ESP has helped me in the past with MegaMillions.</p>
<p>However, my luck with the scratch off tickets may very well have been from ESP.  When I first decided to go on my road trip to buy winning lottery tickets, I actually got a flash of the map I would end up driving before starting the trip.  I didn&#8217;t record it at the time because I was trying to focus on intention manifestation - not ESP :-P.  I didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by using ESP :-P.</p>
<p>And finally, before I end this post, I should also note that I tried to win the lottery using Remote Viewing in the past, and failed.  I did this when I was around 20 years old, and the reason I believe I failed was because of lack of skill, incorrect technique, and bad experiment design.  But hey, it was my first one, so I can&#8217;t be too hard on myself :-P.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s game time though :-P.  I&#8217;m 200x more sensitive and accurate now compared to where I was 4 years ago.  If I didn&#8217;t already know I would be correct, I would amaze myself :-P.</p>
<p>Also: if you saw my last post, then you saw my sweet ass lottery machine.  It&#8217;s in development, and not completed yet.  I shall be posting more videos as I build it.  It&#8217;s gonna kick ass :-).  Oh goodie&#8230;</p>
