				<div class="entry">
					<p>If all my decisions can be traced back to the automated processing of my subconscious&#8230; do I ever make real decisions?</p>
<p>Why do I even exist?  Why am I even aware of this moment?</p>
<p>Evolution, psychology, sociology, chemistry, physics&#8230; these disciplines outline a very clear message.  I can see the fear laced beneath the surface of the scientist&#8217;s dissertation.  The message is that we don&#8217;t exist.  Everything has been accounted for.  We know who, what, when, where, how.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see beauty in this system&#8230; I see amazing beauty.  Numbers can do amazing things; I get it.  But they&#8217;re still just numbers.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fun exercise: identify something you feel is sacred.  Maybe God, or music, or poetry, or a religious text, or reproduction, or relationships, or family, or perpetual motion, or secret government, or morality, or correctness, or cleanliness, or technology, or whatever.  Then, immerse yourself in it, and learn and experience everything about it.  Push yourself to the very brink.  Do not deny yourself any piece of relevance.</p>
<p>What will you learn?  The object itself was never sacred.  It&#8217;s perceived sacred-ness was a projection from the inner workings of your own mind.  There is no such thing as &#8220;sacred&#8221;.  It&#8217;s just your mind.</p>
<p>Everywhere I look, all I see is mind.  This computer is mind.  This music is mind.  This air.  These feelings.  I cannot escape mind.</p>
<p>I know I am not mind&#8230; but I can&#8217;t not use mind in order to search for myself.  And I can&#8217;t not use mind to express this.</p>
<p>The point is this:</p>
<p>Mind is not real.  By extension, reality is not real.  I&#8217;ve been chasing my shadow, for a glimpse of my face.  Is Nothing worthwhile?  Will Nothing satisfy my thirst for existence?</p>
<p>Ramblings.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I have a secret to tell everyone about psionics&#8230; others have figured it out already, but it&#8217;s time I let everyone know officially&#8230;</p>
<p>All techniques are bullshit.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need articles, you don&#8217;t need guidance, you don&#8217;t need answers, and you don&#8217;t need belief systems.  The only thing you need to do is look inwardly.</p>
<p>Now maybe that sounds like <em>I&#8217;m</em> the one bullshitting at this point :-).  Maybe I am! ;-D</p>
<p>Emotion is the name of the game.  Emotion is the currency of will power.  The only door that needs to be opened is understanding what you feel and why.  And the only way to do that is to look inside yourself.</p>
<p>The only benefit I can provide to you is simply putting into words what you <em>already</em> instinctively feel.  And maybe (if I&#8217;m lucky) I can also give you clues as to why you feel the way you do.  But ultimately - you don&#8217;t need me to do so.  It&#8217;s all inside yourself right now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>If I had malicious intent, I could play your emotions, and convince you that you need me.  This is what the vast majority of society does.  We go around, deceiving others into thinking they need us, and allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking we need something external to ourselves.  But ultimately, that&#8217;s not true.  There is nothing external to ourselves that we need.</p>
<p>Now some nit-pickers might argue that we need food, or oxygen.  No, we don&#8217;t.  Our <em>bodies</em> need food and oxygen.   Or maybe you&#8217;ll argue that we need love and attention.  We certainly need love - but must we look externally for love?  And we certainly don&#8217;t need attention - that&#8217;s your ego talking.  Be careful with how you define those words too - they&#8217;re certainly vague enough to cause confusion :-P.</p>
<p>The reason that all psionic techniques are bullshit is because the only purpose the techniques serve is to manipulate your emotions, in order to generate will power.  The techniques are 100% dependent on how well they can stir up emotions in your current belief system.  Techniques don&#8217;t produce results.  Emotions do.</p>
<p>Therefore, to become good at psionics, you must understand both what you are feeling, and why.  The better you understand yourself, the better you can recruit your emotions to serve your goals.  The only way to accomplish this is to dig inwardly.</p>
<p>Somewhere, under the layers of self-delusion and confusion, there exists a God-like being.  Stop searching outside of yourself.  Stop feeding your ego.  Will you passionately dig for truth, or will you be yet another victim of mind?  This is the greatest secret of psionics.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>With perception abilities, like empathy (perceiving emotions), telepathy (perceiving thoughts), communicating with your subconscious (perceiving internal messages), or remote viewing (perceiving foreign locations) - the question almost always arises: How do you know what you&#8217;re perceiving is real?</p>
<p>How do you know you&#8217;re perceiving someone&#8217;s emotions correctly and not just making it up?  Their thoughts?  How do you know that when you communicate with your subconscious, that you&#8217;re actually accomplishing something?  How do you know you&#8217;re actually perceiving something accurately?</p>
<p>For certain situations, it&#8217;s pretty easy to test.  If you&#8217;re remote viewing a location, and you want to know how well you did, then go to the location and check it out.  Or if your friend is trying to telepathically send you an image, then look at the image afterwards and see how close you got.  Easy :-).</p>
<p>However, with a lot of &#8220;real world&#8221; applications, it becomes a lot harder.  If I read someone&#8217;s emotions, how can I tell that I&#8217;m really doing it?  If I&#8217;m reading a complete stranger, then it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going to ask them afterwards how close I got.  Or even reading friends - it can be pretty awkward to approach them and ask, &#8220;are you feeling confusion over whether you should continue your relationship, or call it quits?&#8221;  So how do I know that I&#8217;m reading someone accurately?</p>
<p>Or if I&#8217;m communicating with my subconscious&#8230; how can I honestly tell that what I&#8217;m receiving is accurate?  How can I tell it isn&#8217;t just my imagination?  I mean - it IS all in my head - by definition!  A challenging situation.</p>
<p>The answer is: I don&#8217;t know, especially at first.</p>
<p>As a follow up question: if I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m doing it correctly, how do I even know if I&#8217;m doing anything at all?  Maybe I&#8217;m just psychotic?  I mean&#8230; if I can&#8217;t know whether what I&#8217;m doing is real, then it&#8217;s pointless.</p>
<p>My response is: Well, that&#8217;s fair&#8230; at first.  Keep your skepticism on high when you first start - I completely agree.</p>
<p>However :-).  We can be smart about things.  We can stay flexible, be skeptical, but still play along and see what happens.  And that&#8217;s the attitude I encourage.  Be skeptical - but don&#8217;t let that skepticism turn into cynicism.  Keep trying new things, keep experimenting and having fun, keep doubting and questioning.</p>
<p>If you maintain this attitude of having an open, playful, and skeptical mind, then you will succeed.  If you turn off your skepticism, then it&#8217;s possible that you will delude yourself at some point.  So skepticism serves us well.  If you turn off your open mindedness, then the skepticism will overtake you and you&#8217;ll develop cynicism.  With this attitude, it&#8217;s very possible you&#8217;ll do something amazing, but completely ignore it.  So open mindedness is very important too.  Therefore, the goal is to maintain a healthy balance between the two extremes.  The middle path.</p>
<p>Let me relate to you what has happened to me over the years.  I first started getting into empathy and communicating with my subconscious back when I was 17 years old (I&#8217;m now 24).  I can remember feeling unsure of whether it was working at all.  I can remember specific situations where my subconscious told me something that wasn&#8217;t true, and I questioned if I was wasting my time completely.  Did my subconscious actually not know?  Or was it my fault - and I was bad at communicating?  Or was I just crazy?  I really didn&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>I would go a few weeks, attempting to communicate, and eventually getting pissed and giving up for another few weeks.  Then a day would come by where I would think out of the blue, &#8220;Man, I haven&#8217;t really tried talking to my subconscious in a while&#8230; I should really start doing that again.&#8221;  So I would give it another shot.  Over time, I gradually became more and more confident, and the messages started getting more and more clear.  I&#8217;m at the point right now where I can clearly distinguish between my own thoughts, and the messages from my subconscious mind.  I can easy dictate a conversation, with close to zero effort.</p>
<p>At this point, how do I know that it&#8217;s real?  I just know.  I&#8217;ve developed a feel for it.  It&#8217;s sort of like asking a baseball player: how do you know when to swing the bat?  Well&#8230; they just know.  They don&#8217;t have a formula in their head&#8230; it&#8217;s a feeling they&#8217;ve developed over time.  They know.  The same is true for me at this point.</p>
<p>With the subconscious, my confidence slowly grew over time.  However, with empathy, my confidence was pretty high at the beginning.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone is naturally empathetic, and it&#8217;s inside all of us&#8230; it&#8217;s just a matter of tapping into the right feeling, and then developing it to be more accurate and specific.  Sort of like hearing.  We all hear.  But musicians will develop their hearing to the point of picking out certain notes and frequencies, different layers and instruments.  We all have a natural empathetic sense - and if we exercise it, we can become much more accurate with it, extracting emotions and watching them interact with each other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been confident of my empathic ability, because I can just see it.  I honestly can&#8217;t think of a time when I read a situation incorrectly.  Like I said - with empathy, it&#8217;s something we all have.  Even when I was bad at empathy, I still read things correctly - I just read them with less detail, and couldn&#8217;t piece it together as well.</p>
<p>How do I know when I read something if I&#8217;m correct?  Well, I make predictions based on what I read.  For example, if I read that a girl is starting to think sweet thoughts about me, then I will predict that she will attempt to ask me out on a date in the near future.  However, if I read that she isn&#8217;t the sort of girl to ask a guy out on a date, then I will predict that she will have her friends ask me about her, so she can get a feel of the situation.  And if I know that I&#8217;ll reject the idea of a date, then I can see how she&#8217;ll emotionally respond to this, and what her reaction will be.  I can see that she will reason that we just need to spend some time together in social situations&#8230; so I can see that she will attempt to set up social situations where we hang out.  And I can keep going further into the future, predicting my emotions, and sensing how she will react to them.  I can make an entire timeline for the next couple months.</p>
<p>Now - I see all of this about a week before it even begins.  How do I know how accurate my empathy is?  I watch and see how accurate my predictions become.  And if I have 100% accuracy, then I can be confident that my empathetic perception is real and accurate.</p>
<p>If I test my empathy with predictions every now and then, I can get a sense for how accurate it is.  Then when I read a situation that I can&#8217;t test, I can still be confident that my empathetic perception is correct.  I might not be able to test that specific situation, but why doubt it?  I&#8217;ve proven myself credible.  So I trust in my ability.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be a little hard to trust in these strange abilities at first.  So don&#8217;t.  Keep that skepticism high, but also keep an open mind.  Over time, things will start to add up, and you&#8217;ll develop the confidence through seeing the results.  It might not be 100% accurate, but if it&#8217;s accurate sometimes, and the accuracy keeps improving, and you can FEEL the improvement, then you&#8217;re on your way.  Eventually you&#8217;ll reach a point where you can be confident in your abilities, because you&#8217;ve proven them to yourself.  Until that time comes, have fun, and do your best :-).</p>

					<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>
<p>http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/08/a-better-life/</p>
<p>Enjoy, if you haven&#8217;t already seen it.</p>
<p>-Fred</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Sean,<br />
This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />

<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>

<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>
<p>in pychcology (a cource in our highschool),   our class tryed to learn to read these little cards with stars and circles on them and send them to each other telepathicly and the to best two people would do it together at the end of class in front of everyone. unforunately im not in my telepathic buddy&#8217;s class <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> but if i was we totaly would have stomped everyone into the ground and won.) anyways i just thought you&#8217;d find it pretty awsome that we actually got a chance to show off our telepathy skills in front of everyone in school.<br />

<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>

<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of learning to communicate with your subconscious mind.  How does it work though?  Are we really speaking with our subconscious mind?  How can we test it?  What explanations are there?</p>
<p>I believe our minds have a function to &#8220;tune into&#8221; a personality.  We can do this in a minor way, by simply asking ourselves, &#8220;What would Bethany think about this?&#8221;  But we do this in a major way all the time - I believe our current personality is simply a result of this &#8220;tuning&#8221; process.  When I act things out, I am asking myself the question of, &#8220;What would Sean think about this?  How would Sean react?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you may complain that what I&#8217;m describing is very unlikely, because we ARE our personalities.  How is it that we tune into ourselves?  I AM Sean&#8230; I don&#8217;t ask myself, &#8220;What would Sean do?&#8221;, I just DO what I want to do.</p>
<p>I disagree.  If I tell myself that I am Sean, then I run into some problems trying to explain some things.  However, if I tell myself that I am something else, and I tune into the Sean personality, then a lot of things make sense.</p>
<p>How does channeling work?  How do people have multiple personalities?  How do we communicate with our subconscious?  If my personality changes over time, am I still me?  Ultimately: who am I?</p>
<p>Have you ever become fed up with your personality?  How can that be?  Who are you at that moment&#8230; your personality, or the something that&#8217;s fed up?</p>
<p>This idea of tuning into a personality solves a lot of questions.  In channeling, the psychic starts to behave as though they are some other personality.  We can easily see how that&#8217;s possible in the theory I&#8217;m outlining.  The psychic simply tunes into the desired personality, and acts out whatever that personality decides.</p>
<p>For people with multiple personalities: one explanation is that they can&#8217;t lock onto one personality like the rest of us have, and their tuning process is out of control.  They involuntarily jump from personality to personality.</p>
<p>For communicating with the subconscious, I offer a similar explanation.  We build this idea of who and what our subconscious is, and then we tune into that.  The question becomes, &#8220;What would my subconscious think about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation offers some solutions to common enigmas.  For example, if I can communicate with my subconscious, and you can communicate with yours&#8230; and we both ask our subconscious about something, and they contradict each other&#8230; then who is right?  Who is wrong?  What is the explanation for how the subconscious mind can be wrong about something?  In the past, I offered the explanation that there was a miscommunication (which is still possible), but now I offer another explanation as well: we have simply tuned into different personalities, and the personalities disagree.</p>
<p>You may ask: how is it that we receive psychic information from these personalities?  The subconscious is more than just a personality in our head&#8230; it can deliver psychic information that can&#8217;t be known otherwise.  The same argument holds for channeling.</p>
<p>I offer the explanation: we are psychic.  We already have the information.  We simply need the personality to express the information to ourselves in a format we agree with.  Our beliefs about reality force us to experience the information through the personality instead of experiencing it directly.  After all&#8230; why do we ask our subconscious about things?  Because we believe the subconscious knows something we don&#8217;t.  We tell ourselves that we can&#8217;t possibly know some factoid, so we must experience it through communicating with a personality outside of our own.  We tune into the personality that best represents our definition of what &#8220;subconscious&#8221; is, and prepare ourselves to receive the information we already know about.</p>
<p>WWJD?  &#8220;What would Jesus do?&#8221; (for a klondike bar?).  Another example of personality tuning.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to share this link that I&#8217;ve had stored away for a long time.  It&#8217;s an exercise for &#8220;borrowing&#8221; someone else&#8217;s genius.  Basically, the question becomes, &#8220;What would a genius think?&#8221;, and develops an exercise for tuning into this genius personality.  <a href="http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm">http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm</a></p>
<p>I may write on this topic some more, because I feel as though I&#8217;ve just skimmed over it.  Any questions, feel free to ask.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I think about the nature of choice and free will quite a bit.</p>
<p>I already know that free will exists.  Philosophy majors can bite me :-P.  Free will exists because I see myself using it all the time.  I&#8217;m not going to get into a debate about determinism.</p>
<p>But how do we make decisions?  What is a decision?  Can we break it down to a chemical reaction in our brains?  Or a specific electric current flowing through the neurons in our noggins?  I believe we could find some things in my head that relate to my decisions, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the starting point of the decision.  The chemical reactions are simply side effects.</p>
<p>The only possibility I see is that decisions originate from the quantum world.  &#8220;Spritual&#8221; or whatever.  I don&#8217;t see any other option (of course, just because I don&#8217;t see it doesn&#8217;t mean another option doesn&#8217;t exist :-P).</p>
<p>Then I think: I think way too much!  Does this even matter?  I make decisions <em>all the time</em>.  I don&#8217;t need to know how it functions to use it.  Here it is&#8230; some mysterious decision making process.  Now what will I do with it?</p>
<p>Well, I want to win the lottery, and I believe that I can choose to win.  So how am I going to do that.  Hmm.</p>
<p>My brain tells me there are two angles for attack: 1. perceive the winning numbers (ESP), or 2. affect the drawing (Micro-PK).  However, my intuition says that there is a third option&#8230; and my intuition tells me that this third option is related to intention manifestation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the intuition some more&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t worry so much! :-)  Yes, intention manifestation is the starting point.  The brain fails you in this situation because ESP and Micro-PK are dependent on the idea that the observer is separate from the observed.  Intention manifestation is more correct because it uses the truth that we are all in the same pool of reality, interconnected.  Even if you don&#8217;t want to accept that, then look at the facts.  Remember that intention manifestation actually produced results in the past - ESP and Micro-PK didn&#8217;t come close.  Now, the intention manifestation model isn&#8217;t perfect&#8230; you&#8217;ve already torn it apart in previous posts.  But it is useful at this stage, and a step forward.  My recommendation is to start intending again.  Forget about all the theories, explanations, and thought-junk; Just Do It.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned how to make a training regiment and stick to it.  I&#8217;ve proven this with my physical training.  Perhaps it&#8217;s time to start exercising my ability to manifest as well.</p>
<p>Start low, increase slowly.  I&#8217;ll start today, intending to win the MegaMillions Jackpot, visualizing myself having the winning ticket.  I&#8217;ll focus on this for one minute without interruption.  And I&#8217;ll increase it by a minute every day.  By the end of September, I&#8217;ll be intending for over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>So I had a lucid dream last night.  Before I continue, I&#8217;d like to point out that the MegaMillions Jackpot is at $45 million - <a href="../../2007/06/03/the-lottery-one-last-time/index.html">the amount I require before I start playing</a>.  Back to my dream&#8230;</p>
<p>Before I fell asleep, I told myself that I wanted to have a lucid dream so I could investigate the lottery.  Maybe get some numbers, or some techniques&#8230; something.  Seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>I became lucid a few hours into sleeping, during the beginning of a long period of dreaming.  I knew I had a lot of time to kill before I would wake up (as long as I didn&#8217;t excite myself too much), and decided to get some answers about the lottery.  I was inside a huge Victorian house that was also partly a mall, and there were tons of people around me.</p>
<p>I started by grabbing the next available person, and asking them, &#8220;How do I win the lottery?&#8221;  They said they didn&#8217;t know.  I asked another person.  They didn&#8217;t know.  I went up to another person, and declared that they would be representing my subconscious mind.  I asked them how to win&#8230; they had a slightly longer response that boiled down to not knowing.</p>
<p>I left the area I was in, pretty frustrated.  I saw some children playing, and asked them what they were doing.  They said they represented different parts of myself - different characteristics.  I asked them how to win the lottery - I asked them for numbers, and for techniques to try.  They didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>By this time I was getting a little frustrated.  I began searching for someone who should know, instead of asking random strangers.  I would see someone and scoff them away, because I knew they wouldn&#8217;t know.  Person by person&#8230; I floated downstairs, partly surfing on the banister (hey, I was lucid, might as well have some fun :-P).  I turned a corner and saw a religious black man, who looked like a shaman.</p>
<p>I made friends with him and asked him how to win the lottery.  He told me he didn&#8217;t know of the top of his head, but he knew where we could find out.  He said he could look it up for me (in a book?), and to follow him.  So I did.</p>
<p>We winded around the house, going all over, and eventually found the stairs to the basement.  We went down, but it wasn&#8217;t a basement - it was the outdoors.  It was shifting between night time, and day time, in the matter of a few seconds.  He started doing some ritual, and the stars in the sky started to move.  He told me he would find out by reading the stars.  I told him I thought he was going to use books in a library - he said he could do that too, but that we could also use the stars.  I said ok.</p>
<p>I watched him manipulate the stars into weird patterns.  They rotated around the sky as he &#8220;read&#8221; them.  I tried to read them too, but I didn&#8217;t get it.  Unfortunately, I had been lucid for an extremely long time at this point (perhaps 15 minutes), and my lucidity started to fade.</p>
<p>While he was manipulating the stars, a women offered us some food samples.  Cakes, brownies, and chocolates, and stuff like that.  At first I said no, because I wanted to only eat healthy food, but then I realized it was ok because it was a dream.  While eating the food, I became distracted, and lost my lucidity.  After that, myself and the shaman forgot about the stars, and got stuck in these narrow tubes in the yard.  Lucidity was gone, and I forgot about my lottery goal.  No results.  <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I find that my dream characters are worthless when it comes to usable information.  In the past, I have asked them for help on different topics, and they always fail to provide anything substantial.  I remember one time, while lucid, I decided to track down a &#8220;psychokinetic master&#8221; and ask him techniques.  When I found him, and asked him, all he gave me was a simple chakra meditation.  Another time, I was lucid and asked to speak to my subconscious.  A man walked up to me, but it quickly turned into helping someone with a drug addiction (that doesn&#8217;t exist).  Another time I also asked to speak to my subconscious -  the receptionist told me I&#8217;d have to call him.  After finally getting a hold of my subconscious on the phone after some trickery, nothing was beneficial.</p>
<p>And most of the time in my dreams, all the dream characters do is try to convince me I&#8217;m not dreaming.  What a waste.  I&#8217;m lucid - I know I&#8217;m dreaming.</p>
<p>I also asked about the lottery when I first started playing.  My dream gave me numbers&#8230;. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3.  Needless to say, they didn&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>I wonder how people have precognitive dreams.  While my dreams are fun and useful in self-discovery, they always fail at helping figure out things about reality.</p>
<p>Bah.</p>

					<p>How do I use my own psychic skills in my daily life?  Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that everyone is psychic.  We use our psychic abilities all the time.</p>
<p>The second thing to realize is that when we use our psychic abilities, we don&#8217;t go out of our way to do it.  It&#8217;s part of our thinking process, and happens in harmony with our other normal functions - like memory, emotion, associations, etc.</p>
<p>We have to sort of step outside of societies limiting ideas, and look at reality.  Reality doesn&#8217;t distinguish between a psychic skill, and some other mental skill.  It&#8217;s all where you want to be, doing what you want to do.  Reality doesn&#8217;t monitor your mind, saying, &#8220;Oh, now Sean is using a psychic skill&#8230; cool&#8221;.  It&#8217;s just me being me.  And you being you.  It&#8217;s natural.</p>
<p>Even saying that some function is a &#8220;psychic ability&#8221; is a little incorrect.  I mean - what if I ask you, &#8220;When did you use your memory today?&#8221;  How do you answer that question?  Well, first you have to use your memory to think back on today&#8230; so there&#8217;s one :-P.  Then you might think of conversations you had with people, and think back to a point in that conversation when you used your memory&#8230; which is pretty much every 3 seconds :-P.  It&#8217;s just as hard to answer, &#8220;When did you use your psychic abilities today?&#8221;  Every 3 seconds I use them, in whatever way my mind needs at the moment.</p>
<p>For example, when writing the beginning of this post, I instinctively asked my subconscious how to phrase certain parts, and asked for clarification on ideas.  Before I started writing, I asked my subconscious if I should write a post today, and also checked the date of my last post.  Then I remembered reading a comment asking about how I use my subconscious on a daily basis.  I debated whether writing this post, then decided to start, partly because I felt confident that my subconscious would help me if I ran into trouble explaining something.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m at work, and reading a book.  There is a psychic function for reading a book, it almost feels like&#8230; it&#8217;s more than just reading over letters on a page - it&#8217;s a transfer of ideas and beliefs.  It&#8217;s a two-way conversation with the author.  If I want, I can see the author in front of me, explaining his or her ideas to me.  I can see them animated and excited during - what they feel - are the important parts.  I can ask questions, and get answers.  I can ask for clarification, or examples.</p>
<p>I can see the thoughts that led up to the authors point of view.  I can see how they think.  I can see the environment the author lives in.  I can see the difficulties they&#8217;ve experienced.  I can see the realizations they&#8217;ve attained, and the obstacles they&#8217;ve overcome.  Is this &#8220;psychic&#8221;?   Reality is one big blur - how do you draw a line in liquid?</p>
<p>Now - we can practice psychic abilities, and make them stronger and more accurate.  The same way we can exercise our memory, or muscles, or learn a song on guitar, or play chess.  Whatever you focus on gets stronger.  But you do need to realize that the distinction between one skill or another is just in your head.  Whatever your goals are, there is a cost in an amount of focus you need to spend to acquire them.  If you want to be a rock star, then you better spend a lot of your focus on playing guitar.  If you want to receive psychic information, then you better spend a lot of your focus on meditation and receptiveness.  If you want to acquire truth, then you better spend a lot of your focus on self-realization, and inward digging.</p>
<p>When people ask me how I use psychic abilities on a daily basis, these are where my thoughts go.</p>

					<p>Josh e-mailed me the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What techniques or thought trails did you follow to help put up that &#8220;translator&#8221; between yourself and your mind&#8230; because to hear you think it there are 3 entities we possess our minds, our bodies, and our subconscious.  You found a way to put up a translator between the three.  That is my largest desire with my mental development, as I&#8217;ve been attempting to accomplish for a couple years now, to no avail.  Sure I interpret it, and get messages I can manipulate to make sense, but to hear you say it, you have conversation with yourself <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />  Kind of jealous in that respect.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight and thoughts you can share.</p></blockquote>
<p>I got interested in speaking to my subconscious after I read <a href="http://robertpeterson.org/chap10.html">chapter 10</a> from Robert Peterson&#8217;s book, <a href="http://robertpeterson.org/obebook.html"><em>Out of Body Experiences: How to Have Them and What to Expect</em></a>.  Read the chapter if you haven&#8217;t.  It recounts how Peterson came into contact with his &#8220;inner voice&#8221;, which is the same thing I use (I just call it my &#8220;subconscious&#8221;).</p>
<p>I started the same way Peterson did&#8230; just asking myself random questions, and listening for the answer.  At first it doesn&#8217;t feel like anything special is going on.  I can remember feeling frustrated with the supposed &#8220;answers&#8221; I was receiving.  They weren&#8217;t clear, they were too short, too quick, and it felt like 90% of the time I wasn&#8217;t even getting a response.  When I felt I had actually gotten a response, a lot of times it was incorrect.  Very frustrating.</p>
<p>I kept at it.  Asking myself questions, and listening.  After about a month, things started to improve slightly.  Slowly, over time, it began to personify.  This took a while&#8230; perhaps 6 or 8 months.</p>
<p>The key, in my opinion, is to tell which thoughts are yours, and which thoughts are from your subconscious.  This isn&#8217;t something that can be taught - it&#8217;s something you have to monitor the inside of your own head, and get a feel for it.  Thoughts, ideas, pictures, emotions, associations, etc, are bouncing around in your head constantly.  Before I communicated with my subconscious, I really wasn&#8217;t aware of how much shit goes through my head at any given moment.  Now, I can see most thoughts and emotions pretty clearly.  When something new arises, I am aware of it, and see it clearly for what it is.</p>
<p>That sort of mental identification is pretty tricky at first.  If you are to look inside the mind of any normal person, there is so much shit going through it.  Even &#8220;stupid&#8221; people have extremely fast minds, jumping from one topic to another, with a flood of memories, emotions, ideas, etc.  We can take control of this process, and become aware of it.</p>
<p>One fun exercise is to just sit and think.  Sit and think for 20 minutes, about whatever you want to think about.  Switch topics whenever you want.  Just float around and think, with no rules on what you can&#8217;t think about.</p>
<p>After the 20 minutes, go back and try to remember every topic you thought about.  Every thought that went through your mind.  Every memory that triggered a new line of thinking.  For example, if I try this, I might remember thinking about a girl I&#8217;m interested in.  But I&#8217;ll also remember thinking about how my cats spill water in the kitchen all the time.  How did I jump from a girl to my cats spilling water?  How did my mind make that jump?  At first you might not be able to answer that question.  But with practice, I can see that I was thinking about the girl, then I was thinking about my past girlfriend, then I thought about the time my past girlfriend cooked me a meal, then I thought about seeing my roommate cook a meal with his girlfriend, then I thought about the kitchen, then I thought about my cats spilling water on the kitchen floor.  This sort of jumping around happens in an instant, and it can be very hard to get a hold of because it&#8217;s so quick.</p>
<p>Track it down.  Notice when you recall a memory.  Notice when you jump from one topic to another.  You don&#8217;t have to stop yourself - just NOTICE it.  Be aware of it.</p>
<p>When you ask yourself a question, your mind will start all these acrobatics.  It will start pulling up a memory, playing a video, digesting an emotion, flickering an idea&#8230; all at once.  I know I tell people to get their mind to shut up, but you can also try the opposite.  Let your mind wander.  But identify everything that&#8217;s happening in your mind, when it happens.  Slow it down, and watch yourself.</p>
<p>Practice that.  Over time, you&#8217;ll get a real sense for how your mind works.</p>
<p>Ask yourself a question, and listen for the answer.  Watch your normal mind routine, and discard it.  Look for information that doesn&#8217;t originate from your mind.  An idea, or an emotion, or a feeling of truth will pop-up out of nowhere.  Investigate it.  Pull it in, and open it up.  What do you feel?  What do you see?</p>
<p>I know I stress that translation is important, but if you are aware of the thoughts in your own mind like I described earlier (being aware of when you access a memory, and how you jump from topic to topic, etc), then translation will come naturally.  Once you hit that point, you&#8217;re already aware of what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>In this post, I tried to present the subconscious from a different angle.  Hopefully this alternate perspective will help :-).  Good luck, and feel free to post any follow-up questions in the comments.</p>
