					<p>Not a whole lot going on right now&#8230; But I do manage to keep myself busy.  My current projects are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Win MegaMillions.  The jackpot is below $45 million, so I&#8217;m not playing right now.  My current strategy is to just pick numbers off the top of my head, with no overall understanding or strategy.  This is based on the idea that I&#8217;ll never fully know how it works, but I just have to trust that it will work.  I&#8217;m also working on my lottery machine, but since it&#8217;s construction won&#8217;t help my current strategy, it&#8217;s not a priority.</p>
<p>2. Video tape myself having an out of body experience.  I&#8217;ve started getting into the habit of training myself to OBE again.  I&#8217;ve noticed that my OBEs have dropped in frequency over the past months, and that bothers me.  So I&#8217;m resuming my training, and also video tape myself at the same time, with the idea that if I have an OBE during a training session, it will be on camera.</p>
<p>3.  I&#8217;m reading the book, <em>Science and the Akashic Field</em>, by Ervin Laszlo.  It&#8217;s interesting, but it really hasn&#8217;t captured my interest completely yet.  Perhaps in the later chapters it will do so.</p>
<p>4. Unrelated to the paranormal, I&#8217;ve been working a lot on another site of mine, <a href="http://codetank.com">codetank.com</a>.  It&#8217;s purpose is to teach programming, and provide a nice and fun environment to learn programming in.  I have a few games online, and it&#8217;s slowly growing.  Fun :-).</p>
<p>Nothing terribly exciting this moment, but maybe I&#8217;ll start seeing results with the lottery or start having some OBEs again.  I&#8217;m beginning to have consistent lucid dreams (I&#8217;ve had an LD every night for the past three or four days now), which is usually a sign that my training is having an effect.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I had an OBE this morning.</p>
<p>According to my logs, my previous one was August 5th, so I was certainly due for one.  I used to have them about once a month, but now it&#8217;s more like once every two or three months.</p>
<p>Even though I hadn&#8217;t had an OBE in a long time, I was fairly confident that I would have one.  I fell asleep accidentally watching TV at 8pm, and woke up at 2am.  Then I spent 5 hours messing around on my computer, and doing laundry.  I fell back asleep at 7am, with the intention of sleeping for 3 hours.  I knew it was likely that I would have an OBE because of the awkward sleeping schedule I was demanding from my body.</p>
<p>Whenever you change your sleeping pattern like that - whether it&#8217;s accidental or on purpose - it increases your chances of having an OBE drastically.  The trick is to sleep about 1.5-3 hours less than what you are comfortable with.  I usually sleep between 7.5-9 hours a night (which is a lot compared to most), so when I only slept for 6 hours because I fell asleep early, my body was very confused.  Was that my &#8220;night&#8221;?  Should my body be prepared to be awake now?  Or are we going back to sleep?  What the hell was that?</p>
<p>By staying awake for another 5 hours, but not really doing that much physically, my body stayed confused.  Finally, when I lied back down, my body hesitantly went back to sleep&#8230; but didn&#8217;t go into deep sleep.  This is perfect for OBEs.  It might not be too healthy :-P, but every once in a while it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>During my OBE I floated around quite a bit.  Since I was expecting it, I remained calm, and didn&#8217;t try to &#8220;control&#8221; anything.  I just drifted.  I went up through the ceiling, then drifted back down&#8230; then through my apartment, and close to my kitchen.</p>
<p>My vision faded in and out during that time, and I was playing with just trying to remain as passive as possible.  This helped my vision a lot.  When I relaxed, and didn&#8217;t try to force my vision, it would gradually fade in.  Everything had that trademark gray glow that is normal in OBEs :-).</p>
<p>At one point, while floating through my kitchen, my feet started to get pulled back towards my body.  I didn&#8217;t fight it, because I didn&#8217;t really care, so I slowly went back.  I woke up back in my body, and looked around without moving.  I played around with the vibrations at this point, and just observed them.  At one point I remember thinking the vibrations were too intense, so I stopped playing with them, and forced myself to wake up completely.  Upon waking and moving around, I noticed my right arm had been numb from loss of circulation.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why I got yanked back?</p>
<p>Overall, it was a fun experience.  I just moved into this apartment about a week ago, and it&#8217;s cool to have an OBE in it so soon :-).  I enjoyed the passive attitude I had, and it made the OBE less frustrating, and more like a calm roller coaster.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll have another one soon, because usually they come in groups of two or three.</p>

<p class="postheader"><small class="postauth">October 11th, 2007 by <a href="../../../../index.html@author=2.html">Sean</a></small><span class="posttitle"><a href="../../../../2007/10/11/hearing-voices/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Hearing Voices">Hearing Voices</a></span></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ah, hearing voices :-).  Is there anything more creepy and weirder than that :-P.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are psychotic people in the world who claim to hear voices, but are really just insane in the membrane.  I honestly don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m one of those people :-P.  But talking about voices in your head is a good way to get people to question your sanity, which can really spice up a conversation :-).</p>
<p>The types of experiences I have - I believe - are somewhat normal, just slightly more frequent and extreme.  Everyone hears a tiny voice in their head they call a conscience.  Everyone gets gut feelings.  Everyone has dreams.  When I talk about voices in my head, I&#8217;m talking about the same exact phenomenon - only more frequent, and more clear.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been putting emphasis on paying attention to my dreams.  I&#8217;ve been going to bed earlier (due to new work hours), and this has altered my dreaming experience.  I&#8217;m having longer lucid dreams, with different feels to them.  Nothing drastic&#8230; just a slightly different vibe.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m talking about all this is because this morning, I had a weird experience :-).  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had an experience quite like it in the past.  It wasn&#8217;t mind blowing, but it did strike me as interesting and unique.</p>
<p>I went to bed with a lot of life-problems on my mind, trying to sort them all out.  I tossed for about an hour and a half, just thinking about life.  When I finally went to bed, I had some cool lucid dreams, that consisted of flying around, and teaching my dream characters how to alter their dreams.  This is a common theme for my lucid dreams.</p>
<p>I woke up about 15 minutes before my alarm.  I came back slowly on purpose, playing around with my mental state, like I normally do.  I was fading in and out, and all of the sudden, a clear message started getting transmitted to me, out of the blue.  It started to form a dream, but I was on a border-line state, so the dream didn&#8217;t take hold.  The message repeated itself two or three times, and it felt like it was urgently trying to be sent to me before I woke up.</p>
<p>The message was basically that solutions arise from action.  I have a tendency to think about things too much (gee, ya think?), and over-analyze things.  Sometimes my thoughts paralyze me, and stop me from acting, because I don&#8217;t see any correct paths.  So I don&#8217;t take any path.  The message that repeated to me was basically: when there are no correct paths, just take action, and the correct path will reveal itself.  Then you can hop over to that path.  There&#8217;s no need to see the correct path before taking action.</p>
<p>Pretty basic lesson, which I&#8217;ve certainly learned and studied in the past.  But it was interesting to receive it in a border-line state of mind.  It felt like the message was coming from outside of myself, being urgently sent to me, and repeated on purpose.  Just to ensure I would get it before waking up.  I would like to think that there are &#8220;spirits&#8221; out there watching my back, and this definitely gives me that feel.  Maybe some day I&#8217;ll be able to figure out the validity of the experience.  Until that day arrives, it will have to be cataloged as: &#8220;Important message received from unknown source, by questionable means.&#8221; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

					<p>I get a lot of e-mails.  I read them all, and I always feel bad when I don&#8217;t reply to one.  So I&#8217;m going to reply to some of the shorter ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean,<br />
I&#8217;ve read your blogpost about extending your blog to a community website<br />
this morning.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a while and came up with the following<br />
idea.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>My idea was to let everybody create their own blog inside of your<br />
community, where they can express themselves and write about weird<br />
stuff, experiences, etc. To an initial post, one must be able to write a<br />
response (again, cf. youtube) in one&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>This is now kept very short, but can be developed to a whole<br />
community-system. I like the idea and it may serve ALW&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank you for your blog as it contains some valuable<br />
thinking.</p>
<p>See you,<br />
kiepmad</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting idea that I may use at some point.  I thought about doing something similar back when PsiPog was active, but never got around to it.  I like the idea of people talking about weird experiences they&#8217;ve had in one central location, because that makes it easy to start categorizing and studying phenomenon - seeing when two people experience the same thing, and they couldn&#8217;t have influenced each other - etc.  Good idea&#8230; I may do this one day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean.I have a question that i really want answered.here it goes:<br />
when your trying for an OBE do u have to try to leave your body,or does it happen by itself?if you answered it would be highly appriciated.<br />
Thanks,Ian</p></blockquote>
<p>Some OBEs happen completely by accident and you don&#8217;t have to try at all.  However, if you want to induce an OBE, then you will have to put forth some effort.  The effort is usually in the form of progressive relaxation (meditation) technique.  You can find some how-to information on both PsiPog.net and in the How-To category on this site.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you might be asking: do you have to try and leave your body after the progressive relaxation?  Meaning - after all that stuff, and you are on the border-line&#8230; do you have to actually TRY to leave at that moment?  The answer to this is: usually no.  Sometimes yes.  But most of the time (especially when you&#8217;re first starting out), you&#8217;ll almost &#8220;stumble&#8221; upon the right state of mind, and find yourself out of body.  A lot of my OBEs I didn&#8217;t even realize I was <em>out</em> of my body at first.  I certainly was trying to have OBEs, but I wasn&#8217;t specifically trying at that exact moment, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it.  (Hopefully that makes sense :-P).</p>
<blockquote><p>So I remember that post you wrote a while back about how you were waiting around to win the lottery to start doing all the things you really wanted with your life.  I think SteveP&#8217;s current article jives pretty well with what you were writing about&#8230;</p>
<p>http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/08/a-better-life/</p>
<p>Enjoy, if you haven&#8217;t already seen it.</p>
<p>-Fred</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the link :-).  That is a pretty good article.  Honestly, I&#8217;m sort of sour on the whole &#8220;personal development&#8221; scene lately&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  Part of me just thinks it&#8217;s all bullshit :-).  However, the link is helpful, so thanks for sharing :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Sean,<br />
This is Maila (pronounced My-lah), aka Mari, from your ALW site (BTW you did pronounce it correctly in the video, yay you <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I have an acquaintance who recently started broadcasting a show on Blog Talk Radio (don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of it). I thought almost immediately of how cool it would be to be able to talk &#8220;on air&#8221; in real time with you and other members of ALW about , well, whatever the varied topic du jour. Thought you might be interested in checking it out so I figured I&#8217;d pass it on:<br />
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/faq.aspx</p>
<p>Later,<br />
~Maila</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting idea.  We used to use Skype back in the PsiPog days, with some of the moderators, and chatters.  It was fun :-).  It reminds me of Coast-to-Coast-AM.  It&#8217;s actually a really cool idea now that I&#8217;ve sat and thought about it some more :-P.  This is another idea I will have to keep in my head.  Thanks :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!</p>
<p>Im a big fan of u!!!<br />

because im trying 6 months&#8230; and nothing&#8230;<br />
now&#8230; i dont know if this is real and keep trying&#8230; or if this is a bullshit and give up&#8230;</p>
<p>Telekinesis is real???<br />
If is&#8230; can u tell me some tips?</p>
<p>Tks in adv.</p>
<p>Ur big fan&#8230;<br />
Frank</p></blockquote>
<p>TK is real.  However - that doesn&#8217;t mean you should keep trying the same thing for 6 months!  If it&#8217;s been 6 months, and you&#8217;ve been trying the same thing with no results, then it might be time to try something new.  I&#8217;ve never been particularly great at TK - I recommend reading articles by JoeT and Float on upconline.net.  We tested JoeT&#8217;s skills using the geiger counter, and he&#8217;s definitely legit.  We didn&#8217;t test Float, but I&#8217;ve known him for a long time, and I personally trust him.  So track those guys down - they definitely have more experience at TK than I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>ok sean, i thought you&#8217;d find this interesting.</p>
<p>in pychcology (a cource in our highschool),   our class tryed to learn to read these little cards with stars and circles on them and send them to each other telepathicly and the to best two people would do it together at the end of class in front of everyone. unforunately im not in my telepathic buddy&#8217;s class <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> but if i was we totaly would have stomped everyone into the ground and won.) anyways i just thought you&#8217;d find it pretty awsome that we actually got a chance to show off our telepathy skills in front of everyone in school.<br />
your friend,<br />
brad<br />
P.s. did you get arrested for graffitting that sign? lol</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome!  Sounds like Zener cards :-).  Did anyone in your class have a significant performance?  And no, I didn&#8217;t get arrested - actually we cheated and digitally altered the video to make it look like I painted the sign, without actually painting it in real life ;-).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sean,</p>
<p>How do you think the video board is working out? I will probably get around to posting an actual video once I get settled into my new station in Utah (ugh). I admire the individuals who have been brave enough to post videos of themselves so-far.</p>
<p>I finally graduate out of this crazy school this Thursday. It&#8217;s a shame we couldn&#8217;t have had a beer together. It would probably have made for some of the most intriguing conversation I have had to date. Oh well, my thoughts flow better through text at any rate.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Myrmior</p></blockquote>
<p>The video board is slowing down :-P.  Partly because I haven&#8217;t been participating like I should be.  I may post a video this weekend to try and get something rolling.  I e-mailed some of the old moderators from PsiPog about the video board, and only stony was available to participate&#8230; so that kind of bummed me out a little bit.  I was hoping I could attract a few more mods.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, a beer would have been interesting :-).  However, like you, my thoughts are also better formatted for text :-P.  Perhaps we&#8217;ll cross paths in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there , i;m from poland and i read all of your articles day by day . YOU MAKE MY WORLD BETTER !<br />

<p>Thank YOU!  And you&#8217;re welcome! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;m honored to have helped in some way.

<blockquote><p>Hi Sean!<br />
I have 2 very important questions about the sub-c link, but first I have to tell you my philosophy….hopefully I won&#8217;t bore you to death but the main idea counts:<br />
&#8230; I believe that if you can control your sub-c just like your conscious you can do ANYTHING you can imagine…..since then I read more on the net and that conclusion has grown stronger <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ……now I&#8217;m trying to find a way to control my sub-c but the only idea I have until now is that link…pls tell me what you think about it…..and now the questions:<br />
1   When I read about the link with the sub-c I was very enthusiasmed about the idea and wanted to try…..but last night another thing came to my mind: If I make that link and the sub-c makes a personality of it&#8217;s own I won&#8217;t be able to get control of it like my conscious…..is it true? If it is then I can&#8217;t make that link……and that sucks! :((<br />
2  If hopefully I can still get total control of my sub-c even if it makes a personality of it&#8217;s own, will I be able to ask it to make me different (after I make the link) …..I mean stuff like healing or making me stronger( I once read a story about a father who got<br />
the strength to lift a car when it was about to fall on his child…..and I know for sure that the power came from his sub-c after receiving a strong emotion)? And did you ever ask it to change you?<br />
Thanks and I hope you write more about the sub-c on your 2 sites…Bye!</p></blockquote>
<p>To preface, I have to disagree with your philosophy.  However, you might be right, and I might be wrong.  But just in general, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the theory that controlling the subconscious will allow us to control ANYTHING imaginable.  But who knows?</p>
<p>1. The subconscious doesn&#8217;t really make a personality of it&#8217;s own&#8230; I know when I write about my subconscious, a lot of times it seems like it has it&#8217;s own personality.  Which it does in a sense.  But it&#8217;s still just an extension of myself.  It&#8217;s not like another PERSON inside of me.  It&#8217;s me!  Just a different part of me, that my conscious mind doesn&#8217;t normally have access to.  Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;losing control&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Yes&#8230; sort of.  You can ask your subconscious to change parts of you, and it might comply&#8230; however - probably not in the sense that you&#8217;re thinking of.  I&#8217;ve used my subconscious to make more long term changes that took weeks or months to accomplish (like stronger muscles, or different psychological lessons).  I&#8217;ve had very little success with rapid short term changes.  For example, if I told my subconscious, &#8220;Send me adrenaline so I can lift a car&#8221;, I highly doubt it would work.  (Though to be fair, I&#8217;ve never tried it :-P.)</p>
<hr style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>As a tip for anyone who sends me an email in the future, the best way to get a reply is to be short and sweet, and not have overly complicated questions.  And if you don&#8217;t get a reply - ask again in a week!  I get a lot of e-mails, and I quickly forget when someone sends me an email unless I reply immediately after reading it the first time (which is rare).  So send me another, and keep bugging me until you get a reply.  I honestly don&#8217;t mind as long as it&#8217;s not TOO rapid :-P.</p>
<p>I also hope the authors of the emails that I shared don&#8217;t mind that I posted them publicly.  If you do mind, then just throw me another email and I&#8217;ll edit it out of the post :-).</p>

					<p>About once every month or two, I have a night where my dreams are exceptionally vivid.  Where I attain 100% lucidity, and I see the environment so clearly that I&#8217;m in awe of it&#8217;s clarity.  I just had such a night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are others out there who have experienced such vividness in dreams, though I suspect it&#8217;s somewhat rare.  I believe it&#8217;s a more &#8220;extreme&#8221; form of lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s different from an OBE.  OBEs have a very unique taste of their own :-P.  Perhaps what I&#8217;m describing is what people call astral projection?  And OBEs are etheric projections?  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What I experience does seem real, on some level though.  But it&#8217;s on the same continuation as dreaming&#8230; whereas an OBE is definitely a thing of it&#8217;s own.  Let&#8217;s see if I can map it out&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dreamlayout.png" alt="Dream Map" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty :-).  So anyways&#8230; about once every month or two I have an OBE, and once every month or two I have a &#8220;hyper&#8221;-lucid dream.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the &#8220;real&#8221;-ness of the experience where things get weird.  While experiencing each phenomenon, how &#8220;real&#8221; it feels is very different, and the types of experiences I have are very different:</p>
<p>1. Laying down in bed.  100% real :-).</p>
<p>2. Trancing.  I have definitely experienced a lot of bizarre things here, but <em>most</em> of the time it feels pretty solid.  I&#8217;d say 95% real here.  You can experience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia" target="_blank">hypnagogia</a> here as well, but it&#8217;s not especially vivid, and you are clearly rooted in reality.</p>
<p>3. Blackout.  Loss of consciousness.  Can&#8217;t really evaluate this spot :-P.</p>
<p>4.  Sleep Paralysis.  This is where you return from a blackout, and can&#8217;t move your body.  There can be some really strange hallucinations here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Hag_Syndrome" target="_blank">Old Hag Syndrome</a>).  It&#8217;s about 70% real.</p>
<p>5. Out of Body Experience.  This is where you perceive your consciousness outside of your physical body.  There are definitely hallucinations here, but the realness is still high.  The experience simply feels real.  I&#8217;d say it feels 100% real while experiencing it, and 60-70% real after we return to our bodies and reflect on the experience.</p>
<p>6. Light Hallucinations.  If you can get to this stage, either by skipping over the blackout, or just waking up afterwards, you&#8217;re on your way to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Wake-initiation_of_lucid_dreams_.28WILD.29" target="_blank">WILD</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia" target="_blank">Hypnagogia</a> takes over, and the experience <em>looks</em> more vivid, but it clearly <em>feels</em> fake.  Around 5% real here.</p>
<p>7. Normal Dreams.  This is your run of the mill dream.  You may experience some precognition, or talking to dead relatives here&#8230; which (in my opinion) means that they have some &#8220;real&#8221;-ness in them.  And dreams normally feel real while they are happening, but upon reflection they don&#8217;t feel real at all.  I&#8217;d say feels 80% real at the time, and 15% real after we wake up upon reflection.</p>
<p>8. Lucid Dreams.  This is a dream where you are aware that you&#8217;re dreaming, while still inside the dream.  There are different levels of lucidity&#8230; for the average lucid dream, I would say it feels 80-90% real at the time, and maybe 15-30% real after we wake up upon reflection.</p>
<p>9. Hyper-Lucid Dreams (maybe Astral Projection?).  This is what I experienced last night, and is somewhat rare.  The dream is 100% lucid, and exceptionally vivid.  There is detail in everything, and it has crystal clarity.  It&#8217;s very awe-inspiring to look at and absorb.  It feels 100% real at the time, and feels about 40-60% real after we wake up upon reflection.</p>
<p>There we go :-).  That&#8217;s a pretty good map of the things I&#8217;ve experienced, and I hope it paints a clear picture on how the experiences fit together, and how real they feel while they are happening, and after the fact.  I&#8217;d be interested to know if anyone has experience with astral projection, and can either confirm or deny my relation to them.  Comments and questions beloved :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<h3>My First Weird Experience</h3>
<p>Before I became interested in psychic abilities (because I thought they were fake), I had a strong interest in hypnosis.  I was about 14 or 15 years old, and I saw a hypnotist on TV knocking people out and making them do weird things, like make out with brooms.  I was intrigued instantly.</p>
<p>As any nerd would do, my natural reaction was to go to the library and read every book on hypnosis I could find.  Unfortunately, there weren&#8217;t any.  There was only one in the catalog, and I had to order it from another library.  A tormenting week later, the book finally arrived, and I dove in.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t try hypnotizing anyone else&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really care about making other people look silly.  I wanted to try this stuff up close and personal.  The only chapter that interested me was the one titled, &#8220;Self-Hypnosis&#8221;.</p>
<p>I did the exercises, and they mostly didn&#8217;t do anything.  It put me in a light trance, but even then&#8230; it was more like - &#8220;Did I do it?  Was I hypnotized?  Or just messing with myself?&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t have any solid success.  I kept at it for a while (probably a month or two), but nothing crazy was happening, so I eventually lost interest.</p>
<p>Except for one experience&#8230; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>At the time I didn&#8217;t make the connection, and concluded that self-hypnosis didn&#8217;t work for me.  Looking back, I now know that my experience was directly related to my practice with self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night, and was laying in bed.  The next thing I remember, I could hear people faintly.  The volume gradually increased until I could hear a crowd of people as if they were standing all around me.  I&#8217;m talking about actually <em>hearing</em> people.  If someone started a conversation with you in real life right now - that&#8217;s the exact kind of hearing I experienced.  Real hearing.  As if they were physically right next to me.</p>
<p>I could make out the voices and sounds.  It was as if I was walking down my hallway in high school, between classes.  I could hear some of my friends talking, and other acquaintances.  I could listen to the entire crowd and take in all the mur-murs, or I could focus in on one group of people and hear specifically what they were talking about.  Just like in real life.</p>
<p>I was absolutely amazed.  I was fully aware that I was laying in bed, in the middle of the night.  My eyes were even partly open.  I was completely calm and conscious.  But I heard voices :-P.  Perhaps I am crazy? <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  It wasn&#8217;t a dream, although part of my brain might have been in a dream state.  Eventually I fell asleep, after listening for about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<h3>Hypnagogia</h3>
<p>Before you actually think that I really am clinically crazy, I should tell you that my experience is somewhat common, and has been scientifically studied.  It&#8217;s called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia">hypnagogic</a> experience.  Weird word for a weird state of mind :-).</p>
<p>The scientific community claims that it&#8217;s a form of hallucination that people experience between the sleep and awake state.  There are a lot of different ways to experience this hallucination.  You can hear weird things (auditory), see weird things (visual), or feel weird things (tactile).  Or maybe a combination.  It just so happens that in my experience, I heard voices.</p>
<p>Since my experience, I&#8217;ve had a lot of hypnagogic hallucinations.  I can sometimes induce them on cue, but usually they just happen randomly.  Some hallucinations are very vivid and seem real, while others are very light and I can easily tell that it&#8217;s something in my head.  Either way, they are a lot of fun to play with, as long as you don&#8217;t get too freaked out :-).</p>
<h3>How to have a Hypnagogic Hallucination</h3>
<p>Chances are you&#8217;ve already had a light hypnagogic hallucination before, you just didn&#8217;t know what it was called.  I believe that day dreams are a very very light form of them (although I&#8217;ve never read research that has made the connection).  A more solid hypnagogic hallucination can be experienced before falling asleep at night.</p>
<p>How?  Simple: trance.</p>
<p>Trance out before you go to bed at night, and weird shit happens.  It&#8217;s a law of the universe :-).</p>
<p>But maybe this is your first time trying to induce a trance, and you have no real clue how to go about it.  Hey, don&#8217;t worry!  It just so happens I have some tips you can try :-).</p>
<p>First, lay down.  Close your eyes.  Sometimes I listen to music, and that can really help a lot.  What kind of music?  Surely you can guess by now: trance music :-).</p>
<p>If you choose to listen to some music, then a great way to get into a trance is to focus ONLY on the music.  Focus on every layer, every instrument, every background ting and whiz.  Make sure the songs are in stereo, and focus on how the left ear is slightly different from the right ear.  Put 100% of your focus in the song.  Forget your body.  Do this for about 20 minutes, and you&#8217;ll be in a nice trance :-).</p>
<p>If you choose not to listen to music, then you might have to work a little harder to trance out without falling asleep.  Progressive relaxation helps.  Basically, just lay there, don&#8217;t move your body, and relax all your muscles.  Then go muscle by muscle, and focus on making sure it&#8217;s completely relaxed.  Start at your feet, work your way up your legs, through your torso, down your arms, into your neck and face.  This entire process should take from 20 minutes to 40 minutes.  It&#8217;s not a race!  Take your time.</p>
<p>If you do progressive relaxation, and get to the end and you still aren&#8217;t tranced out, then just think of nothing.  Focus on thinking of nothing.  Keep doing that.  It&#8217;s hard.  But it works.</p>
<p>Once you get to a solid trance, either by using music, or relaxing your body, then just maintain the trance.  Weird stuff is bound to happen :-).</p>
<h3>What Happens?</h3>
<p>If you reach a trance state of mind, then you won&#8217;t be fully aware that you&#8217;re trancing out.  It&#8217;s like watching a really good movie.  It sucks you in and you completely forget that you&#8217;re sitting in a theater, watching a movie.  It&#8217;s like day dreaming.  If you try to pin down, &#8220;ok, NOW I&#8217;m day dreaming&#8221;, then you miss it.  But if you just let go and experience it, then you flow in and through it, and you realize afterwards what happened.</p>
<p>So what happens when you&#8217;re trancing out?  For me, usually something will yank me back.  Maybe I was trying to think of nothing, and a flood of thoughts rush into my mind.  Or I&#8217;ll hear something.  Or I&#8217;ll feel someone poke me :-P.  Hello hypnagogia!</p>
<p>Once a hallucination yanks me out of my trance, I don&#8217;t have to go back into a trance.  I can just lay there, stay calm, and play around with the hallucination - completely aware of what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>I experience hypnagogic states of mind about five times a month.  For example, last night I saw some weird stuff.  I went to bed, listening to some trance music.  I listened attentively for about 20 minutes, focusing only on the music, before I tranced out.  Then a flood of images and videos came at me.  It yanked me out of my trance, but the hallucination continued.  I saw faces and people - I was inspecting them and trying to memorize their faces.  This continued for about a minute.  The faces flashed by me quickly.  I didn&#8217;t recognize anyone :-P.  It was crystal clear though.  It wasn&#8217;t blurred, or fuzzy around the edges.  I saw it clearly.</p>
<p>Sometimes I experience auditory hallucination like I did during my first experience.  When I reach that state of mind, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m a radio, picking up whatever I want.  I can tune myself to music, and listen to songs in my head, with crystal clarity and perfect recall.  Or I can tune myself to specific people, and hear them talk.  For example, I may get yanked out of a trance hearing my friend say something (&#8221;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to just talk to him?  Maybe I just don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;).  I can tune in to that friend, and listen to them talk.  Or I can change to another person and listen to them.  Or change to music.  It&#8217;s fun :-).  And it&#8217;s all crystal clear, as if it was happening right in front of me.</p>
<p>In the same way, when I experience visual hallucination, sometimes I can tune it as well (but for me, tuning a visual hallucination is harder).  I remember one experience where I tuned into receiving cartoon characters.  Why?  Boredom I guess :-).  I tuned my hallucination to only show me cartoon characters.  I received a stream of different characters for a few minutes, changing about every second, like a slide show.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you want to experience something truly weird, then trance out before you go to bed at night.  Don&#8217;t have any expectations.  Just trance out.</p>
<p>If you can keep your cool, then you&#8217;re bound to experience some strange hallucinations.  It&#8217;s a lot of fun to play with.  It&#8217;s also amazing the first couple of times, because the hallucinations seem very real, and if you&#8217;ve never experienced a hallucination, it can be shocking to see how clear a hallucination can be.</p>
<p>If you do it a lot, you may figure out how to take slight control over a hallucination, and tune it in a certain direction.  It&#8217;s cool :-).  No drugs necessary.</p>
<p>Have fun!  If you have a question, feel free to ask in the comments.  Or if you&#8217;ve had a strange hallucination in the past, feel free to share as well :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today I present two short posts in one:</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that I just had an out-of-arm-experience.  I have these every once in a while.  Someone called me at 9:45am speaking Spanish that woke me up.  I went back to bed in a weird state of mind.  I did dream some, but I also experienced laying in bed messing around with my arms.</p>
<p>The experience went on and off for about 20 minutes.  I was laying in bed, looking at my wall, and my arms were &#8220;out&#8221; of my body.  I couldn&#8217;t see them, but I could sense where they were.  I moved them in front of my face, trying to see them, but no luck.  I felt my face with my hands, and my hands felt my face, but my face didn&#8217;t feel my hands.  It was pretty cool.  I had an experience like it before, years ago when I was 16 years old.</p>
<p>I almost decided not to post about it, because it was a mundane experience, but there was one important feature.  On my wall, I have playing cards taped to it for decoration.  While having these out of arm experiences, I focused on one of the playing cards to keep my consciousness aware.  When I woke up, it dawned on me that I should check that specific card to see if I perceived it correctly.  While in the bathroom, I predicted the card would be dark with two symbols on the front.  When I checked, I was correct - it was exactly as I remembered it.  This isn&#8217;t die-hard proof of anything, however it is an interesting thing to note.</p>
<p>In other news&#8230; <a href="../../../../2007/04/30/steorn/index.html">Steorn</a>, the guys who claim to have discovered perpetual motion, had a public demonstration July 6th, 2007.  Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/07/steorns-ceo-states-the-obvious-we-screwed-up/">they couldn&#8217;t get their technology to work</a>.  Here is a video of Sean McCarthy making excuses.  I didn&#8217;t watch the whole thing because of the bad quality and length, but maybe someone else is interested:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The great thing about out of body experiences is that ANYONE can learn and see it with their own eyes.  Let&#8217;s start at ground zero:</p>
<h3>What is an Out of Body Experience?</h3>
<p>An out of body experience (OBE) is when you perceive your consciousness outside of your body.  The basic outline is that you lay down, meditate or trance out, and at some point you start to float outside your body.  Sometimes this feels so real that you&#8217;re not even sure if you&#8217;ve left your body.  There have been times when I&#8217;ve fallen out of my body, and thought I actually fell out of my bed physically!  Only to &#8220;wake up&#8221; back in my bed, slightly confused :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to wrap our minds around what an OBE actually is.  If you read about OBEs, then you might draw the simple idea that it&#8217;s like being a ghost, floating around going through things.  This idea could be true to some extent, but you&#8217;ll be very disappointed if you think you can just get up and do whatever you want once you leave your body.  Once you leave your body, motion, sight, logic, memory, and other basic functions need to be re-learned.  I&#8217;ve been having OBEs for 8 years and I still can&#8217;t move around freely every time.</p>
<p>Other people might argue that OBEs are a form of hallucination or dream.  After all - a lot of OBE techniques focus on going to sleep and messing around with altered states of consciousness.  It seems like a logical explanation on the surface.  However, just like the ghost explanation, it&#8217;s an oversimplification.  It&#8217;s true that during an OBE you will probably experience hallucinations of some sort&#8230; there have been OBEs where I perceived my environment completely wrong.  Garages in the wrong location, outdoor decks that don&#8217;t exist, paint cans that don&#8217;t exist, etc.  But there are also experiences where I&#8217;ve perceived things accurately that I couldn&#8217;t have known otherwise - in my favorite experience, I saw a black plastic washer on the ground.  Upon waking up, I realized it was really a black guitar pick that I had dropped.</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence that OBEs are real to some extent is that during my 8 years, I&#8217;ve always experienced the OBE in the same location as my physical body (<a href="http://www.psipog.net/blog/2006/02/possible-obe.html">except <em>maybe</em> once</a>).  You can&#8217;t say that about dreams.  Nearly all dreams are in foreign locations, like schools, malls, fields, etc.</p>
<p>My point is that OBEs are weird :-).  I hate when people try to simplify it without having personal experience or doing any research.  It&#8217;s like being a ghost, but it&#8217;s not that simple.  Some parts seem like hallucinations, but it&#8217;s not that simple.  So whatever your opinion is, please be aware that this is not an easy thing to explain, and if you find yourself simplifying it in your mind, the most likely reason for that is that you haven&#8217;t researched it enough, and/or you&#8217;ve never had one.</p>
<h3>Strong Desire Method</h3>
<p>There are an unlimited number of techniques to achieve an OBE.  There isn&#8217;t one set way to do it.  Here is one method that I&#8217;ve had success with:</p>
<p>Have a burning desire and unhealthy obsession with wanting to leave your body.  Want it more than you&#8217;ve ever wanted anything else in the world.  If you can achieve that level of emotion, then you&#8217;ll have one.</p>
<p>Now why does this work?  Perhaps you want it so much that you brainwash yourself into having one?!  That&#8217;s not good!  Well, relax for a second :-).  I&#8217;ll explain why this works, and then maybe you can understand the sort of &#8220;desire&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about.  I&#8217;m not talking about the &#8220;self-delusion desire&#8221;.  I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;every level of being desire&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason this method works is because the gateway to an OBE is in an altered state of consciousness.  When you&#8217;re in an altered state of consciousness, you think differently.  You make different decisions.  Logic functions differently.  Memory functions differently.  Emotion is different.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced this.  Has your alarm clock ever woken you up?  You hit the snooze, laying in bed.  The night before you decided to wake up at 6am to go for an early run, but now that you&#8217;re in your comfy warm bed, that logic simply doesn&#8217;t make any sense.  Who cares about exercising?  Screw that.  More sleep.</p>
<p>When you were awake and alert the night before, you made a simple decision: get up early and exercise.  Makes sense to me.  But when you were in a groggy state of mind, a different part of yourself made the decision to stay in bed.  If you think back to the exact moment you made your groggy decision, you can see how your mind functioned very differently.</p>
<p>The burning desire is necessary to overcome this.  If every fiber of your being wants to have an OBE, then when you get into an altered state of consciousness, that altered decision making process will still want an OBE.  This is <em>extremely </em>important.  There are states of mind where it&#8217;s almost a completely subconscious decision.  If you really want to have an OBE that&#8217;s great.  But if your subconscious fears or desires are screaming &#8220;No way!&#8221;, then when you hit that altered state of consciousness, you will resist having an OBE.</p>
<p>To understand this method, simply understand that when you&#8217;re in an altered state of consciousness, you make different decisions.  It&#8217;s that simple.   As another example&#8230; have you ever had a weird dream?  Of course!  One of my dreams today consisted of me making sure no one contaminated the ingredients to a juice maker.  Some guy was being a jerk and messing around with the equipment, and it was my job to get him out of there, so the juice would be free from contamination.  Now that I&#8217;m awake, I see how silly the entire situation is.  But at the time, I was in an altered state of consciousness, and my decision making process was completely different.  My memory was different.  My emotion was different.</p>
<p>Had I had a burning desire to leave my body, then even the part of myself that felt it was necessary to guard a juice maker would have wanted to leave.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion&#8230;</h3>
<p>OBEs are weird.  We might be tempted to explain them using simple ideas, but we should remind ourselves that reality isn&#8217;t as simple as our beliefs would like reality to be.  Research and personal experience can keep us rooted in reality.</p>
<p>One method to leave our body is to have a strong desire on every level of our being.  The reason this works is because we need to make the decision to leave our body while in an altered state of consciousness.  We&#8217;ve already seen in our past experiences how an altered state of consciousness usually makes strange decisions.  Having a burning desire to leave our body will ensure that even our altered decision making will point us in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>You&#8217;ll have to forgive me.</p>
<p>I was lying in bed, about to fall asleep, when suddenly a bolt of lightning struck me.</p>
<p>My subconscious made a comment to me.  A very calm and seemingly innocent comment.  Perhaps I&#8217;m just insane :-).  That&#8217;s a much more comforting explanation at this point, it seems :-).</p>
<p>My subconscious revealed the metaphor guiding me these past months.  And now I can come to no other conclusion than this reality is a form of dream.  This idea is so overplayed in religion that it leaves a bad taste on my mouth to say it, but now I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> it with my eyes&#8230; so I have no other choice but to admit it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Ok whoa whoa whoa.  Hehehe.  I am insane :-).  Or maybe I just mind-fucked myself.  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>There is a deeper meaning behind our personal realities.  Everything <em>does</em> happen for a reason.</p>
<p>Look&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to go into the realization I made, because it&#8217;s pretty personal, and I don&#8217;t feel like spilling my heart all over the internet for everyone to see :-P.  I mean, I like you guys and everything, but not that much :-P.  But I can break it down from another perspective that is understandable, now that I have some hindsight.</p>
<p>When I say that &#8220;reality is a form of dream&#8221;, what I&#8217;m talking about is how dreams have deeper meaning when looked at from a metaphorical perspective.  So does this reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very interesting to analyze your own dreams and see how things manifest.  For example, dreaming of taking a shit can represent unloading emotional waste that&#8217;s built up inside of yourself, and be a sign of growth and psychological cleansing.  So in real life, perhaps you are dealing with old problems that you feel need to be taken care of for you to move on, and tying up loose ends.  As a result, one night you dream of taking a massive shit in a bathroom.  You wake up thinking, &#8220;Now where did that come from?  Very bizarre!&#8221;  But there is an underlying meaning.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.</p>
<p>So, what I&#8217;m saying is that this reality also has this same <em>exact</em> sort of deeper meaning.  What we manifest in this reality is a reflection of who we are and what we are dealing with - just like in dreams.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  This is what intention manifestation tries to talk about (but fails, I believe).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that this reality uses the <em>exact same</em> metaphor function that dreams use.  The exact same function.  This is why this reality is a form of dream.  This is also why intention manifestation actually produces results.  It hijacks and focuses this metaphorical function of reality to produce an outcome.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m explaining this correctly or not.  Maybe I&#8217;m not giving enough examples.  Let me try again.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re walking outside, what do you do if it suddenly starts to rain?  Do you run for shelter?  Do you pause and enjoy the sprinkles?  Depending on your personal reality, this reaction means different things.  If you run for shelter, perhaps you do this because you feel you need to run from your problems.  Other problems you experience in life, you run from.  Do you curse the weather?  This might mean you feel you&#8217;re being treated unjustly by &#8220;God&#8221;.  The weather could represent a system that is out of man&#8217;s control, and therefore only under the control of &#8220;God&#8221;.  If it rains on you, you feel that &#8220;God&#8221; is unjustly making your life miserable, so you curse the rain.  It&#8217;s a metaphor.  Do you see how this is the same function as dreaming as well?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all connected.  All the ideas in your head, all the beliefs you hold, all the emotions you feel, all the experiences you have in this reality&#8230; it&#8217;s all connected.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that if you run from the rain, that you run from your problems.  It depends on who you are as a person.  Just like your dreams&#8230; if you dream about being in the bathroom, it might represent a time period where you need to do some psychological cleansing.  But if you are a janitor for a living, then the idea of being in a bathroom would have a completely different meaning to you, since you probably clean a lot of bathrooms for a living.  Perhaps it means it&#8217;s time to clean up someone else&#8217;s mess?</p>
<p>Ok&#8230; so anyways.  The important part about this is that reality does this.  The experiences you&#8217;ve had in your life have meaning.  They happened for a reason.  Think of it like a dream.  What is the metaphor?  What does it emotionally mean to you?  Decode it like you would decode waking up from a bizarre dream.</p>
<p>Now I really do need to get to sleep.  This realization has interrupted me :-P.  I&#8217;ll probably read this in the morning and face-palm :-P.</p>

					<p>I had an out of body experience this morning.  I haven&#8217;t had one in forever.  This has been the longest stretch I&#8217;ve gone without having one (10 months according to my records), and it felt pretty good to get out briefly.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get to explore or anything, unfortunately.  I was mostly stuck in my body.  I could get out for a little bit, but then I would get yanked back.  A pretty standard OBE for me&#8230; it&#8217;s how most of them go.  It&#8217;s annoying to read about other people&#8217;s OBEs, and see how much fun they have.  Mine consist of me floating a few feet from my body, then getting yanked back.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Not terribly exciting.</p>
<p>Of course it is cool just to have an OBE in general&#8230; even if I can&#8217;t get that far away from my body.  Nonetheless, I do wish I could do more exploring.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Most readers probably don&#8217;t understand, so I&#8217;ll explain everything:</p>
<p>An out of body experience (OBE) is when you perceive your consciousness outside of your physical body.  Some people prematurely understand it as floating around like a ghost&#8230; that&#8217;s an extremely extremely simplified explanation.  Things are a LOT more complicated than that.  But if this is your first time hearing about OBEs, that might be a good place to start.</p>
<p>I started training OBEs when I was 15 years old.  It took me 6 months of training before I accomplished my first OBE, when I was 16.  Ever since then, I&#8217;ve had OBEs randomly&#8230; usually at about once or twice a month.  They usually come in spurts, so it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if I have another OBE tonight, since I just had one this morning.</p>
<p>Now, a logical guy would probably say: &#8220;Well, maybe it&#8217;s a hallucination?  Or dream?  How do you know it&#8217;s REAL?&#8221;  To answer that question: immediately, I don&#8217;t know.  And I can&#8217;t tell.  Most OBEs are very strange&#8230; the state of mind is like nothing we normally experience.  It&#8217;s not a dream state of mind&#8230; it&#8217;s not a normal waking state of mind&#8230; it&#8217;s just weird.</p>
<p>But we can be smart about it.  For example, most dreams that we have take place in foreign locations.  I have dreams about being in malls, in houses, in cities, in school, etc.  But OBEs always start in the location where my physical body is at.  This is so consistent, that I keep track of all the locations where I&#8217;ve had an OBE - which is what the list is above.  Those are all the different locations where I&#8217;ve had an OBE.  One notable location is #6.  We were staying in a hotel for one night in South Carolina, and I had an OBE there.  I had never visited the hotel, and I&#8217;ll likely never visit it again.  In my opinion, that is strong evidence that OBEs are more real than dreams.  What are the odds I would have a dream of that location the very night that I was sleeping in it, and fool myself into thinking it was an OBE?</p>
<p>What really convinced me that OBEs are real is <a href="http://www.psipog.net/blog/2005/11/awesome-obe.html">this experience</a>.  In it, I perceived a &#8220;black plastic washer&#8221; on the ground.  Later, when I woke up and checked, it was actually a black guitar pick.  This proved to me that I was perceiving reality when I left my body, because I had no clue that my guitar pick was in the location where I correctly perceived it.</p>
<p>Different people have different beliefs on what OBEs are.  It isn&#8217;t clear cut.  A lot of OBEs contain hallucinations, and merge into dreams.  It&#8217;s not simple.  But there are some key features of OBEs which separate them from dreams, and which prove that they are more real than dreams, as outlined above.  If you want to read about more proof, then I suggest reading Robert Monroe&#8217;s, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journeys-Out-Body-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385008619/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-3226097-7024607?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182096451&amp;sr=8-2">Journey&#8217;s Out of the Body</a></em>.  Monroe&#8217;s work could convince some of the toughest skeptics.</p>
<p>When I decided to shut down PsiPog (my old paranormal website), my OBEs stopped.  I think it was because I was telling myself that I was done with that part of my self, and it was time to grow and change.  Now that I&#8217;ve settled down 10 months later, and am starting to hack reality again, I&#8217;ve had an OBE.  I suspect I&#8217;ll start having them consistently again.</p>
<p>I would recommend everyone train for OBEs.  While it&#8217;s true that my OBEs are usually dull, I have had some really thrilling ones.  And just the experience in general is really amazing.  To turn around, and see your physical body laying in bed&#8230; it&#8217;s scary, it&#8217;s disturbing :-), but it&#8217;s also awesome.  I have no doubt that I&#8217;m more than my physical body, and that I&#8217;m going to survive the death of my body.  And it doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with faith.  I KNOW it.  I&#8217;ve SEEN it.  Having that sense of certainty has made it worth the effort.</p>
