				<div class="entry">
					<p>So I had a lucid dream last night.  Before I continue, I&#8217;d like to point out that the MegaMillions Jackpot is at $45 million - <a href="../../../../2007/06/03/the-lottery-one-last-time/index.html">the amount I require before I start playing</a>.  Back to my dream&#8230;</p>
<p>Before I fell asleep, I told myself that I wanted to have a lucid dream so I could investigate the lottery.  Maybe get some numbers, or some techniques&#8230; something.  Seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>I became lucid a few hours into sleeping, during the beginning of a long period of dreaming.  I knew I had a lot of time to kill before I would wake up (as long as I didn&#8217;t excite myself too much), and decided to get some answers about the lottery.  I was inside a huge Victorian house that was also partly a mall, and there were tons of people around me.</p>
<p>I started by grabbing the next available person, and asking them, &#8220;How do I win the lottery?&#8221;  They said they didn&#8217;t know.  I asked another person.  They didn&#8217;t know.  I went up to another person, and declared that they would be representing my subconscious mind.  I asked them how to win&#8230; they had a slightly longer response that boiled down to not knowing.</p>
<p>I left the area I was in, pretty frustrated.  I saw some children playing, and asked them what they were doing.  They said they represented different parts of myself - different characteristics.  I asked them how to win the lottery - I asked them for numbers, and for techniques to try.  They didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>By this time I was getting a little frustrated.  I began searching for someone who should know, instead of asking random strangers.  I would see someone and scoff them away, because I knew they wouldn&#8217;t know.  Person by person&#8230; I floated downstairs, partly surfing on the banister (hey, I was lucid, might as well have some fun :-P).  I turned a corner and saw a religious black man, who looked like a shaman.</p>
<p>I made friends with him and asked him how to win the lottery.  He told me he didn&#8217;t know of the top of his head, but he knew where we could find out.  He said he could look it up for me (in a book?), and to follow him.  So I did.</p>
<p>We winded around the house, going all over, and eventually found the stairs to the basement.  We went down, but it wasn&#8217;t a basement - it was the outdoors.  It was shifting between night time, and day time, in the matter of a few seconds.  He started doing some ritual, and the stars in the sky started to move.  He told me he would find out by reading the stars.  I told him I thought he was going to use books in a library - he said he could do that too, but that we could also use the stars.  I said ok.</p>
<p>I watched him manipulate the stars into weird patterns.  They rotated around the sky as he &#8220;read&#8221; them.  I tried to read them too, but I didn&#8217;t get it.  Unfortunately, I had been lucid for an extremely long time at this point (perhaps 15 minutes), and my lucidity started to fade.</p>
<p>While he was manipulating the stars, a women offered us some food samples.  Cakes, brownies, and chocolates, and stuff like that.  At first I said no, because I wanted to only eat healthy food, but then I realized it was ok because it was a dream.  While eating the food, I became distracted, and lost my lucidity.  After that, myself and the shaman forgot about the stars, and got stuck in these narrow tubes in the yard.  Lucidity was gone, and I forgot about my lottery goal.  No results.  <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I find that my dream characters are worthless when it comes to usable information.  In the past, I have asked them for help on different topics, and they always fail to provide anything substantial.  I remember one time, while lucid, I decided to track down a &#8220;psychokinetic master&#8221; and ask him techniques.  When I found him, and asked him, all he gave me was a simple chakra meditation.  Another time, I was lucid and asked to speak to my subconscious.  A man walked up to me, but it quickly turned into helping someone with a drug addiction (that doesn&#8217;t exist).  Another time I also asked to speak to my subconscious -  the receptionist told me I&#8217;d have to call him.  After finally getting a hold of my subconscious on the phone after some trickery, nothing was beneficial.</p>
<p>And most of the time in my dreams, all the dream characters do is try to convince me I&#8217;m not dreaming.  What a waste.  I&#8217;m lucid - I know I&#8217;m dreaming.</p>
<p>I also asked about the lottery when I first started playing.  My dream gave me numbers&#8230;. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3.  Needless to say, they didn&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>I wonder how people have precognitive dreams.  While my dreams are fun and useful in self-discovery, they always fail at helping figure out things about reality.</p>
<p>Bah.</p>

					<p>And now for something completely different&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a near-lucid dream this morning.  I was walking around, and found myself in a zoo.  I got myself stuck, and had to go down some stairs, but there was a <a href="http://badgerbadgerbadger.com/">huge snake</a> guarding it.  Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t notice until I was so close the snake was right on my foot.</p>
<p>At first I was afraid to get bitten, but then I started to become partly lucid.  I knew that if I feared the snake biting me, then it would bite me.  Instead of focusing on the fear, I decided to try to focus on getting the snake to leave me alone.  I started to visualize the snake going down the stairs, and leaving.  It didn&#8217;t leave&#8230; but instead, the snake started licking my foot playfully.</p>
<p>I believe there are lessons to be had in dreams.  If you&#8217;ve never had a lucid dream, then I recommend training for it.  That applies to anyone.  We sleep one third of our life - it&#8217;s amazing we don&#8217;t take that time period more seriously.  No matter what your beliefs are about what dreams are - there is one thing for sure.  <strong>You choose</strong> how to navigate your dream.  And you use the same decision making process in your waking life.  Dreams give us the opportunity to test our belief structures in fantasy situations without putting ourselves in real danger.  They&#8217;re beyond helpful in self-discovery.</p>
<p>Plus it&#8217;s fun.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Also&#8230;</p>
<p>A not-so-funny experience happened.  Yesterday, I reminded myself that I needed to pay my car payment, which requires me to go to the bank.  I asked myself, &#8220;When does the bank close?&#8221; and got a response of &#8220;1:00pm&#8221;.  I thought - gee, that doesn&#8217;t sound right.  When I got home, I checked the bank hours online.  According to their website, they close at 3:00pm.  So I felt confident going to the bank at 2:00pm to pay my bill, despite the little annoying voice within telling me otherwise.  Upon arrival, it turns out it did close at 1:00pm because of Memorial Day weekend.  On their door, they have the normal hours posted, and then a cute little printed paper saying they&#8217;re closing early because it&#8217;s Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>How nice.  Now my car payment is going to be late.  I should have listened to my subconscious.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We are all &#8220;psychic&#8221; &#8212; there is nothing SUPER-natural about it.  It&#8217;s just natural.  Now we might feel a little less special when we think of it that way, but we have to put our ego aside in favor of discovering truth :-P.  Maybe some of you are thinking, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s great Sean, maybe you are psychic (or crazy), but I&#8217;ve never done anything psychic!  So it&#8217;s easy for you to say.&#8221;  Ok fair enough.  Let&#8217;s take Out of Body Experiences, for example.</p>
<p>The basic description of an Out of Body Experience (OBE) is that you lay down, do some meditation or something, and then you find consciousness floating outside your body.  Then you can fly around and do fun things.</p>
<p>Sometimes we become so discouraged by our practice that we feel we&#8217;ll never accomplish our goal.  Hey, cheer up! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  While nothing has been &#8220;proven&#8221; about OBEs, a lot of authors in the OBE field, along with myself, believe that everyone has OBEs every night.  Now don&#8217;t just glance over that idea &#8212; if you&#8217;re training for OBEs, then really digest it.</p>
<p>Imagine that you actually are leaving your body, every night.  Every night, since you were born, you&#8217;ve been leaving your body.  That&#8217;s a lot of experience.  That&#8217;s a lot of OBEs.  Imagine that just last night you left your body.  And the night before.  And tonight.  Get it out of your head that you need to achieve an OBE.  You&#8217;ve already achieved them!</p>
<p>So what <em>do</em> you need to achieve?  Conscious awareness.  Right now you aren&#8217;t consciously aware of leaving your body.  You leave your body every night, but you are zonked out when it&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>The question isn&#8217;t, &#8220;How do I have an OBE?&#8221;  It&#8217;s not a question of techniques, or step by step procedures.  The question you need to pose yourself is: &#8220;How do I become aware of this natural process?&#8221;  Now, we can have some tips that you can try.  But these tips are not full-proof step by step techniques.  They are just tips (that I&#8217;ll address in future postings).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to have an OBE (or even if you aren&#8217;t, but are just curious about it), start by really digesting the idea that you have an OBE every night.  Maybe you don&#8217;t believe it - that&#8217;s fine - but just give the idea a try in your head.  It can change your focus.</p>

					<p>I had a lucid dream last night.  I have them just about every night.</p>
<p>A lucid dream is a dream where you are aware you are dreaming while inside the dream.  I&#8217;ve had them ever since I was a little kid, and it&#8217;s the only weird skill that I really have a natural talent for.</p>
<p>My dreams follow a basic pattern: some authority figure telling me I&#8217;m going to get in trouble for doing something, then me discovering it&#8217;s a dream and laughing in the authority figure&#8217;s face&#8230; then usually flying off and having fun.  Sometimes I&#8217;ll take time to teach my other dream characters how to fly, or how to walk through walls.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to have a lucid dream for yourself.  I think the reason I have them all the time is because, when my mind wanders, it naturally starts questioning things.  Whenever my mind starts to wander in a dream, I start to question my environment, and it turns into a lucid dream.</p>
<p>One technique you might want to try is to start questioning your environment in real life.  Ask how something works (&#8221;What does the inside of that doorknob look like?  How does it do it&#8217;s job?&#8221;), or why someone designed what you&#8217;re experiencing a certain way (&#8221;Does each floor in my apartment have the same layout?  Did they build these stairs last, after everything else was done?&#8221;).  Look around and pick out random things that most people would look over.  Be aware of the movement of your body.  Be aware of the thoughts in your head, and specifically how you react to situations around you.</p>
<p>How we perceive our environment from day to day is extremely important.  For example, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/03/artists_look_different.php" title="Artists look different" target="_blank">check out this post</a> about how artists will look at pictures differently than a normal person.  Interesting stuff!</p>
<p>If you want more lucid dreams, chances are you&#8217;ll have to change something :-).  Where we are is a result of what we&#8217;ve done&#8230; if we want something else, we need to starting doing different things.  Happy dreaming!</p>
