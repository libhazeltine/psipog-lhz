				<div class="entry">
					<p>Happy 11-11!  And now for something completely different&#8230;</p>
<p>If you study philosophy, then you are familiar with the collection of beliefs that fall under the label of &#8220;Determinism&#8221;.  Determinism states that everything in the world is simply cause and effect, and we can predict the future with 100% accuracy if we know the position of every little thing involved.  We just have to apply the math, and calculate the result.  The ability to &#8220;make decisions&#8221; is simply an illusion - your decisions aren&#8217;t an exercise of free-will, they are just the results of all the different chemicals in your head, and electricity bouncing around.</p>
<p>Determinism is anti-intuitive, because when we make decisions, it <em>feels</em> like we are making a choice.  It doesn&#8217;t feel like our choice is just a result of the different neurons in our brain, and chemicals pumping through our blood stream.  It feels like we are genuinely making a conscious decision - that we have free-will.</p>
<p>The argument of Free-Will vs. Determinism is a popular amoung philosophers.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to solve the riddle with this post, but I do believe that <a href="../../../../2008/10/14/introduction-to-quantum-physics/index.html">quantum physics</a> provides us with a framework for making the argument for free-will, based on our scientific understanding of reality.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;God does not play dice with the Universe.&#8221;</em> - Albert Einstein, arguing in favor of Determinism.</p>
<p>Einstein, like many scientists at the time, believed that reality was deterministic.  He believed that scientists would eventually be able to figure out every math formula for how things work, and given enough knowledge, could calculate the exact future.  What instigated Einstein to make such an argument in the first place, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation">Copenhager interpretation</a> of quantum physics, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Uncertainty principle</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of quantum physics, it was hard to make the case for free-will.  Sir Isaac Newton showed us that objects in reality move according to mathmatical formulas.  When you throw a ball in the air, it has a parabolic curve, and we can plot the location of the ball, and predict where it will land.  Sure, there are unknown processes in the world that still needed to be discovered, but it was believed that it was just a matter of time before we had a formula for everything.</p>
<p>The Uncertainty principle changed that.  It&#8217;s discovery told us that we could never reach the holy-land of Determinism.  We could never learn all the formulas, and predict the future with 100% accuracy, because reality wouldn&#8217;t let us.  Uncertainty wasn&#8217;t due to our ignorance - it was hard-coded into reality itself.</p>
<p>While scientists try to remain objective, one couldn&#8217;t help but see the philisophical implications.  If Uncertainty is true, then reality isn&#8217;t deterministic, and there just might be room for free-will in the laboratory.  If free-will does exist, then it is exercised inside the realm of quantum physics.  And if we have free-will, then <strong>consciousness must operate on a quantum level</strong>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I haven&#8217;t posted in over a month.  I had a revelation, which had the effect of removing a lot of my motivation for expressing myself.  In fact, I feel very little drive to make this post&#8230; but I feel I should at least get my words on paper for my own sake - and maybe the few reading can provide insight as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survival of the fitest&#8221; describes so much.  I&#8217;ve obviously read about evolution before&#8230; but it never really hit home until recently.  Everything we see around us is only there because it self-replicates.  The only things that persist are those things that can adapt to their environment, and reproduce.  I&#8217;m not just talking about biology - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">ideas and thoughts</a> are the same way.  In fact, all of life as we know it is a result of self-replication and adaptation.</p>
<p>Now of course, I&#8217;ve thought about evolution in the past, and agreed with it mostly.  I&#8217;ve known the concept of a &#8220;meme&#8221; for years.  It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m talking about any real new idea here.  It&#8217;s just the level of appreciation that&#8217;s changed.  In the past, it was an interesting idea that I touched upon every once in a while, that remained in the back of my mind.  But recently it&#8217;s been thrusted into the forefront, and become a cornerstone of my understanding of what I experience on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>This actually depressed me for quite a while.  It was like beating a game&#8230; yes, it feels great to be done with it, but at the same time it&#8217;s a little bittersweet.  I was happy that I understood a lot of my experiences and beliefs&#8230; but at the same time, depressed that I could no longer be intellectually honest with myself about holding on to stupid ideas.</p>
<p>My depression was eventually overcome.  My subconscious sorted it out for me.</p>
<p>Self-replication explains nearly everything about our human experience.  On a biological, psychological, and philosophical level.  Self-replication is so powerful because it has <em>persisting power</em>.  Everyone has random thoughts, and does random things&#8230; but if those things don&#8217;t persist, then in the long run, you really won&#8217;t notice them.  They will eventually fizzle out.  For example, how many people believe that the Earth is flat?  Not too many.  The idea isn&#8217;t persistent.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine the most persistent thing.  What could adapt and self-replicate the <em>best</em>?  I started listing different organisims in my mind, playing out a long term simulation in my head.  I listed different religions, and my knowledge about how they persisted and adapted to the populace.  Then I thought about just general ideas, and their ability to persist.  Mathematics should persist for a long time&#8230; math is considered a universal language.  What else&#8230; what else&#8230;</p>
<p>Then it hit me: truth.  Truth is the only thing that escapes this need of persistence.  What I mean by that is: gravity will last longer than the human race.  If something is true, then something is true&#8230; permanently.  Truth doesn&#8217;t adapt&#8230; and it doesn&#8217;t self-replicate.  The things that do adapt and self-replicate are constantly trying to align themselves with truth - for survival - but truth doesn&#8217;t really have that problem.</p>
<p>This removed my depression.  But it also removed my desire to share my thoughts with the world.  Who cares if someone disagrees with me?  And who cares if someone agrees with me?  Truth transcends persistence.  So everything is OK.</p>
<p>In the past I felt a need to get my ideas out&#8230; but probably because I was convinced by someone else that it&#8217;s good to get your ideas out.  Because they were getting <em>their</em> ideas out - to me.  The idea of &#8220;you need to express yourself&#8221; is just a self-replicating thought.  If I sit here and preach that everyone needs to get a blog, and tell the world their thoughts&#8230; then those who I convince to do so will spread the same idea&#8230; telling their readers to get a blog, and tell the world their thoughts.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what my line of reasoning is for why people should express themselves&#8230; just the more effective the reason is, the more the &#8220;express yourself&#8221; idea will self-replicate.</p>
<p>But none of that matters now.  Truth trumps all that.  Do I need to convince you that gravity exists?  Uh, no.  A truth will exist whether the conceptualization of that truth is self-replicating or not.  It&#8217;s not so much &#8220;who gives a shit&#8221; as it&#8217;s &#8220;truth has <em>already</em> won the fight&#8221;.</p>
<p>So&#8230; with that said&#8230; perhaps you can see why I feel no motivation for expressing my thoughts (as much as I used to, at least).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I feel like such a sucker for thinking so much about the topic of winning the lottery, but I can&#8217;t help it - it embodies everything I care about, in a poetic sense.  Perhaps I just use it as an excuse to think about hard topics? ;-P</p>
<p>I was laying in bed, throwing my orange ball up at the ceiling, debating with myself about the morality of winning the lottery.  If I could find a way to win, would it be cheating?  What overall goal am I aiming for, and is this goal moral?  Am I just doing it because I want to escape the rat race of living paycheck to paycheck?  Or is there an honest and healthy reason for my obsession?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t lie to myself&#8230; I know that part of me desperately wants to transcend society&#8217;s dependence on money.  By winning the jackpot, I will essentially free myself from years of burden and conformity required by society in order to pay for the necessities of life.  But free myself to what end?  What would I do with my time, once liberated?</p>
<p>There is a divine balance to reality.  Any push away from truth creates a perfectly calculated, equal and opposite push towards truth.</p>
<p>If my theories are correct, then society has made a gamble against truth.  Society has taken the stance of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221;.  The lottery embodies this assumption by society.</p>
<p>But if the assumption is false - if things happen for a reason, and there is an underlying meaning in everything - then I should be able to win the lottery.  Not for the money - but for the point of demonstrating the falseness of society&#8217;s assumption.  After all, who am I to say that I am right, and society is wrong?  What evidence have I presented society with?  As far as society is concerned, I&#8217;m just a peebrain with a blog :-).</p>
<p>So, my goal is to demonstrate to society that the assumption of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221; is false.  Now maybe <em>I</em> am wrong - maybe society&#8217;s assumption is correct.  In which case, I won&#8217;t win the lottery, and my failed demonstration can be used as evidence that some things <em>are</em> random.  Of course, that&#8217;s not the outcome I believe will come to pass :-), but reality will be the judge of that.</p>
<p>Now - I believe that this goal is moral.  My goal is rooted in revealing truth - whether I&#8217;m correct or incorrect.  However, does this answer the question of what to do with the money, once I win?</p>
<p>Yes, I believe it does.  Now that I&#8217;ve defined my goal, and my goal is moral, I can more easily see what follows.</p>
<p>After demonstrating that society&#8217;s assumption is false, I must spend the money on discovering the truth.  It&#8217;s the only moral way to balance out the situation.  I can&#8217;t take advantage of society&#8217;s ignorance, then disappear with the money to lead a selfish life of abundance.  Once I win, it will become my responsibility to spend the money on restoring balance.</p>
<p>So, let it be known:</p>
<p>If I win the jackpot, then I will use the money to research the topic of both how society allows itself to become deceived, and what the truth actually is.  I will create an organization in order to accomplish this research.  I am announcing this because, in the event that I win, I want to ensure that everyone keeps me honest.  I am human, and I will definitely be tempted to just pack up my bags, and live a peaceful private life.  However, since I know that using society&#8217;s ignorance for my own personal gain is immoral, I want to declare my intention publicly.  I will do everything in my power to remain faithful to my word - but, if I start to flake out, then I hope those reading this proclamation will remind me of my obligation.</p>
<p>Oh boy :-P.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Being human, we like to divide reality into different sections.</p>
<p>There is <strong>day</strong> time, and <strong>night</strong> time.  There is the <strong>weekday</strong>, and the <strong>weekend</strong>.  There are people with <strong>lighter</strong> skin, and <strong>darker</strong> skin.  This mentality of cutting reality in half has a name - it&#8217;s called: duality.</p>
<p>Dualistic thoughts can be very useful.  After all, if I want to drive from Maryland to Georgia, it&#8217;s good to know whether I&#8217;m on the <strong>correct</strong> road, or <strong>incorrect</strong> road.  However, a lot of times we use dualistic thinking incorrectly, or trust in it too much.</p>
<p>The problem is this: There is one, and only one, reality.  Thinking dualistically is in direct contradiction to that ultimate truth.  Is it ever <em>really</em> a weekend?  No.  It&#8217;s just the continuous stream of time.  If you go to mars, are there weekends there?  No.  Therefore, a &#8220;weekend&#8221; is not something that is a part of reality.  It&#8217;s just a human thing we do - we divide reality arbitrarily, and label the divisions.</p>
<p>How does this affect us?  Well, there&#8217;s a popular thought that is dualistic in nature, that I talk a lot about: <em>&#8220;If you want to become good at psychic abilities, you must practice.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Hiding behind this thought is a partitioned reality.  Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean the thought is useless.  Clearly there is some truth in there, because people who practice psychic abilities do become more proficient.  But ultimately - the thought has some inherent falsehoods because it&#8217;s reliant on cutting reality in half.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cuts the thought makes, but the one I want to discuss is that it divides experiences into either <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  Encoded inside of &#8220;practice psychic abilities to get better&#8221; is the thought that your current experiences are mostly &#8220;natural&#8221;, and if you want more &#8220;supernatural&#8221; ones, you need to practice.</p>
<p>This is the falsehood inside the thought.  An experience is neither <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  An experience is just an experience!  Reality doesn&#8217;t go around, observing events, judging whether something was bizarre or not - humans do!  Reality doesn&#8217;t give two shits, and just does what it does.  This division between everyday life, and some awesome and profound paranormal experience, only exists in our mind.</p>
<p>Usually dualism isn&#8217;t too bad.  In some cases it can be very dangerous, like racism, religion, or selfishness.  Dualism serves the purpose of helping us understand things in human terms.  But it&#8217;s vitally important to remember that when we are thinking dualistically, it&#8217;s only out of the necessity to break things down to our level, and NEVER a reflection of how reality actually functions.  Reality isn&#8217;t dualistic.  Reality is one.</p>
<p>Only use dualistic thinking in order to serve yourself.  Never enforce your arbitrary divisions on reality itself.  Reality doesn&#8217;t care about whether YOU think an experience is <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong>.  So get over it, and start seeing the beautiful in the ugly, the love in the fear, and the supernatural in the natural.</p>

					<p>I have a secret to tell everyone about psionics&#8230; others have figured it out already, but it&#8217;s time I let everyone know officially&#8230;</p>
<p>All techniques are bullshit.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need articles, you don&#8217;t need guidance, you don&#8217;t need answers, and you don&#8217;t need belief systems.  The only thing you need to do is look inwardly.</p>
<p>Now maybe that sounds like <em>I&#8217;m</em> the one bullshitting at this point :-).  Maybe I am! ;-D</p>
<p>Emotion is the name of the game.  Emotion is the currency of will power.  The only door that needs to be opened is understanding what you feel and why.  And the only way to do that is to look inside yourself.</p>
<p>The only benefit I can provide to you is simply putting into words what you <em>already</em> instinctively feel.  And maybe (if I&#8217;m lucky) I can also give you clues as to why you feel the way you do.  But ultimately - you don&#8217;t need me to do so.  It&#8217;s all inside yourself right now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>If I had malicious intent, I could play your emotions, and convince you that you need me.  This is what the vast majority of society does.  We go around, deceiving others into thinking they need us, and allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking we need something external to ourselves.  But ultimately, that&#8217;s not true.  There is nothing external to ourselves that we need.</p>
<p>Now some nit-pickers might argue that we need food, or oxygen.  No, we don&#8217;t.  Our <em>bodies</em> need food and oxygen.   Or maybe you&#8217;ll argue that we need love and attention.  We certainly need love - but must we look externally for love?  And we certainly don&#8217;t need attention - that&#8217;s your ego talking.  Be careful with how you define those words too - they&#8217;re certainly vague enough to cause confusion :-P.</p>
<p>The reason that all psionic techniques are bullshit is because the only purpose the techniques serve is to manipulate your emotions, in order to generate will power.  The techniques are 100% dependent on how well they can stir up emotions in your current belief system.  Techniques don&#8217;t produce results.  Emotions do.</p>
<p>Therefore, to become good at psionics, you must understand both what you are feeling, and why.  The better you understand yourself, the better you can recruit your emotions to serve your goals.  The only way to accomplish this is to dig inwardly.</p>
<p>Somewhere, under the layers of self-delusion and confusion, there exists a God-like being.  Stop searching outside of yourself.  Stop feeding your ego.  Will you passionately dig for truth, or will you be yet another victim of mind?  This is the greatest secret of psionics.</p>

					<p>Hidden behind the idea of &#8220;practice&#8221; and &#8220;success&#8221; is this idea of separation.</p>
<p>If we want to become a great baseball player, then we clearly need practice.  Becoming a great baseball player takes some natural talent, but like other skills, it mostly takes dedication, training, and repetition.</p>
<p>A lot of times I will equate psychic abilities to other normal skills.  I might say that, just like becoming a great baseball player, if you want to learn to be psychic, then you need to practice it as if it were any other skill.  Don&#8217;t treat it special.  Don&#8217;t think of it as something mystical.  Treat it as if you were learning anything else.</p>
<p>I like this method of instruction for a lot of reasons.  The main reason I like to equate psychic abilities to other normal skills is because it breaks down the association between psychic abilities and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>It would be silly of me to be religious about playing baseball.  While some great baseball players are certainly religious, and some might even claim that their religion has helped them become so great - one thing is certain: You don&#8217;t learn to hit homeruns by closing your eyes and believing in some mystical force.  You hit homeruns by practicing.  Maybe religion plays a role in motivation, but the actual <em>skill</em> needs to be developed, and the only way to do that is to practice.</p>
<p>Likewise, when I talk about psychic abilities being like any other skill, my real goal is to break this mental association between psychic abilities and personal religious beliefs.  I might instruct someone to treat psychic abilities like any other skill, but what I&#8217;m really instructing them to do is to drop their insistence of explaining something unknown using religious ideas.</p>
<p>There is a slight problem with this though.  Psychic abilities <em>aren&#8217;t</em> like other normal skills.</p>
<p>Normal skills need to be learned.  The skill is external to yourself, and through training and practice, you slowly learn to perform the task correctly.  The information on how to perform the task is external to yourself.  Someone <em>else</em> created the game &#8220;baseball&#8221;.  You must learn what <em>they</em> created.  The information is inherently external.</p>
<p>Psychic abilities are not external.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.  This is where the analogy breaks down.  At this point, psychic abilities are not like any other skill.  They are not something created by someone <em>else</em>, that we must learn the rules to.  They are inside ourselves, at this very moment.  We are psychic creatures - right now.</p>
<p>We are not all baseball-playing creatures right now.  Some of us learn to play baseball, others don&#8217;t.  But we are ALL psychic creatures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to think of psychic abilities like any other skill in order to break our addiction of explaining unknown things using religion.  However: once that addiction is correctly broken, we must deal with the reality of the situation.  Psychic abilities are not like other skills.  Normal skills are external to ourselves - something that we must engage with the world around us to learn.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.</p>
<p>Put another way: a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest baseball player of all time, must at some point learn the rules of baseball.  But a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest psychic of all time, doesn&#8217;t have to learn anything.  In fact, they may already BE the greatest psychic at the moment they are born.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself looking externally for answers on &#8220;how to be an awesome psychic&#8221;, remember that you are psychic right now - it is something inside of you at this very moment.  The real question is at what depth do you understand your own true nature.</p>

					<p>Ernesto e-mailed me a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of now, I have just finished reading your incomplete sequel to your first E-Book. It left me feeling empty as your new website does not talk about all of the &#8220;Psi&#8221; phenomenon discussed in your first. I wish you could publish a blog in which you finish expressing the ideas of your sequel. Do you still practice Telekinesis and Psi Balls? Do you have any new ideas about how they function with this new broader outlook?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why I don&#8217;t talk about some of my current beliefs is because they sound insane :-P.  Part of me would rather quietly hold on to my bizarre beliefs, and work on them in private, than to express them for everyone to read and criticize.  Keep in mind that a lot of my friends in real life and co-workers read this blog, and my name is attached to every post, so I feel an increased burden to tone things down :-P.</p>
<p>Another reason I don&#8217;t talk about my current understanding is because it&#8217;s not clear.  I don&#8217;t see it clearly in my mind, so I have a hard time explaining it.  I&#8217;ll start to write a sentence, but it won&#8217;t feel correct, so I&#8217;ll try again.  And again.  Ultimately, the problem is that I haven&#8217;t &#8220;figured it out&#8221; in my own head, so I won&#8217;t write about it.</p>
<p>But for this post - sure, I&#8217;ll give it a shot:</p>
<hr />
<p>The biggest belief that I struggle with is that it is my understanding that reality is a dream of some sort.  And I hate saying that because it&#8217;s very cliché, but I&#8217;ve yet to find any other explanation for what I&#8217;ve observed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined this belief in past posts: <a href="../../../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the things we experience in reality have deeper meaning.  Just like in dreams, where certain metaphors drive the experience, these same metaphors are also the driving forces for what we experience in reality.</p>
<p>The reason why I believe this is because I&#8217;ve been tracking it in my own life.  I have these experiences which are too bizarre to be labeled &#8220;coincidence&#8221;.  I see the metaphors, sometimes while the experience is happening, other times after the fact.  I can predict what&#8217;s going to happen by looking at what the metaphor requires.  A lot of the time I&#8217;m correct (though I will be honest, I am not 100% :-P).</p>
<p>Now of course, the same old arguments can be brought up, that I am biased because I&#8217;m looking for meaning, or that I&#8217;m a sucker, or whatever.  Those arguments don&#8217;t really bother me, because I know I am very honest with myself, and that no one is more critical of my own thoughts than me.  But, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, they do seem like legitimate complaints.  One reason I don&#8217;t like discussing my beliefs is because I&#8217;ll have to argue these worn out positions with people who don&#8217;t care as much as I do.  I&#8217;ve put years of blood sweat and tears into my current beliefs, constantly challenging them from every perspective I can think of, testing reality, forcing myself to drop incorrect beliefs (at the expense of my ego and pride), etc.  It&#8217;s very frustrating to argue with someone who is just trolling around because they have nothing better to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the question that I&#8217;ve yet to answer, is how deep do these metaphors go?  On the surface, it might seem like I&#8217;m just arguing in favor of basic psychology.  I&#8217;ve observed these metaphors manifesting themselves in reality - not just in my own head - so at a minimum I&#8217;m talking about something more than psychology.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m divided between three basic explanations:</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> Reality itself is governed by these metaphors.  Reality <em>is</em> a dream.  Science is derived from this dream.  Examples of this theory are cited in the above links: <a href="../../../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2.</strong> There is an underlying physical reality that is governed by science, but there is a mental reality governed by these metaphors that co-exists with this physical reality.  This would mean that the metaphors are a result of the mind, but that we see manifestations of these metaphors in reality because of large scale unconscious telepathy.  I talk about this idea here: <a href="../../../../2007/11/05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html">Current Understanding of Intention Manifestation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3.</strong> Something I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>If explanation #1 is correct, then reality is a free for all.  There are no rules.  Psionics, and all belief structures, are now easily explained.  This sounds a little outlandish, so I tend to side with #2.</p>
<p>If explanation #2 is correct, then there is a very large question.  How does this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  In this explanation, macro-psychokinesis is not explained.</p>
<p>Most likely, explanation #3 is correct.  But since I&#8217;ve yet to think of it, I don&#8217;t know how it works :-).</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the next question might be: how can we determine which is correct?  What would be a wonderful test that would clear a lot of this up?</p>
<p>Well, winning the lottery.</p>
<p>The lottery is void of mind.  If this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; exists, then the lottery would not be a part of it.  Therefore, intention manifestation wouldn&#8217;t work on the lottery (which is my experience).  So, according to my experiences so far, #2 looks like it might be correct.</p>
<p>However, the problem with #2 is the question of macro-psychokinesis - i.e., how does the &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  Is the physical reality deterministic?  Where does free-will fit into this?</p>
<p>If #2 was completely correct, then you couldn&#8217;t use psychic abilities to win the lottery.  Yet I have already succeeding in breaking the mathematical odds, and other psychics have won the lottery as well. See: <a href="../../../../2007/06/15/psychic-wins-lottery/index.html">Psychic Wins Lottery</a>, <a href="../../../../2007/05/22/i-won/index.html">I Won</a>, <a href="../../../../2007/05/27/i-won-again/index.html">I Won&#8230; Again</a>.</p>
<p>So, #1 doesn&#8217;t feel correct, and my experiences back it up because I failed to win the lottery using intention manifestation.</p>
<p>But, #2 is also incorrect to some extent, because I have succeeded a little bit in winning the lottery, and others have done better than I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, in conclusion&#8230;</p>
<p>In my last eBook, I talked about belief systems, and how we can succeed with psychic abilities using drastically different belief systems.  The question that I had at the end of that eBook was basically: how can that be?</p>
<p>My answer to that question is that reality is some form of dream.  I haven&#8217;t posted a lot on this subject because a lot of the revelations have been very personal as I inspect the metaphors driving my own life.</p>
<p>The next question is: to what extent do these metaphors affect reality?  Either reality <em>is</em> a dream, and physical reality is derived from that dream (#1), OR there is a physical reality, and a mental reality, each governed by different rules (#2).</p>
<p>Judging from my experiences, and my intuition, I believe that #2 is probably more correct.  However, then the question becomes: how is macro-psychokinesis possible?  I.e., how does the mental reality affect the physical reality?</p>
<p>At that point, a good test is to attempt to win the lottery (something completely physical), using mental means (psychic abilities).  This will get me lots of money, play into my own life metaphor, and help answer these glaring questions about how reality works.</p>
<hr />

					<p>A lot of times it feels like I&#8217;m living in a story.  Like reality is just a play - a scripted sequence of events - and we all just play along.</p>
<p>When I talk to someone, I&#8217;m simply reading my lines.  And they return with their lines.  The dialog has already been created, and we simply walk through it.  Just acting it out.</p>
<p>Even the supposed &#8220;zany&#8221; or &#8220;random&#8221; people follow a predefined script.  They say the funny things they&#8217;re suppose to say, and everyone else laughs like we&#8217;re suppose to laugh.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do wonder whether life is deterministic or not&#8230; but I think just the fact that I&#8217;m contemplating such a thing proves that it&#8217;s not.  I don&#8217;t know about anyone else for sure, but I do know that I am aware.  I am aware of this moment.  I can cut right through it.</p>
<p>One thing that makes me curious is to think about my memory.  What am I working with?  What is in my head?  What is my earliest memory?  I mean&#8230; how did I get here?  When did I first become aware?</p>
<p>It seems like I should be able to scan back in my memory, and remember the moment when the I - the me - first arrived.  But instead it&#8217;s just a gradual blur.  Was it always like this?  Am I just in a state of perpetual amnesia?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of learning to communicate with your subconscious mind.  How does it work though?  Are we really speaking with our subconscious mind?  How can we test it?  What explanations are there?</p>
<p>I believe our minds have a function to &#8220;tune into&#8221; a personality.  We can do this in a minor way, by simply asking ourselves, &#8220;What would Bethany think about this?&#8221;  But we do this in a major way all the time - I believe our current personality is simply a result of this &#8220;tuning&#8221; process.  When I act things out, I am asking myself the question of, &#8220;What would Sean think about this?  How would Sean react?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you may complain that what I&#8217;m describing is very unlikely, because we ARE our personalities.  How is it that we tune into ourselves?  I AM Sean&#8230; I don&#8217;t ask myself, &#8220;What would Sean do?&#8221;, I just DO what I want to do.</p>
<p>I disagree.  If I tell myself that I am Sean, then I run into some problems trying to explain some things.  However, if I tell myself that I am something else, and I tune into the Sean personality, then a lot of things make sense.</p>
<p>How does channeling work?  How do people have multiple personalities?  How do we communicate with our subconscious?  If my personality changes over time, am I still me?  Ultimately: who am I?</p>
<p>Have you ever become fed up with your personality?  How can that be?  Who are you at that moment&#8230; your personality, or the something that&#8217;s fed up?</p>
<p>This idea of tuning into a personality solves a lot of questions.  In channeling, the psychic starts to behave as though they are some other personality.  We can easily see how that&#8217;s possible in the theory I&#8217;m outlining.  The psychic simply tunes into the desired personality, and acts out whatever that personality decides.</p>
<p>For people with multiple personalities: one explanation is that they can&#8217;t lock onto one personality like the rest of us have, and their tuning process is out of control.  They involuntarily jump from personality to personality.</p>
<p>For communicating with the subconscious, I offer a similar explanation.  We build this idea of who and what our subconscious is, and then we tune into that.  The question becomes, &#8220;What would my subconscious think about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation offers some solutions to common enigmas.  For example, if I can communicate with my subconscious, and you can communicate with yours&#8230; and we both ask our subconscious about something, and they contradict each other&#8230; then who is right?  Who is wrong?  What is the explanation for how the subconscious mind can be wrong about something?  In the past, I offered the explanation that there was a miscommunication (which is still possible), but now I offer another explanation as well: we have simply tuned into different personalities, and the personalities disagree.</p>
<p>You may ask: how is it that we receive psychic information from these personalities?  The subconscious is more than just a personality in our head&#8230; it can deliver psychic information that can&#8217;t be known otherwise.  The same argument holds for channeling.</p>
<p>I offer the explanation: we are psychic.  We already have the information.  We simply need the personality to express the information to ourselves in a format we agree with.  Our beliefs about reality force us to experience the information through the personality instead of experiencing it directly.  After all&#8230; why do we ask our subconscious about things?  Because we believe the subconscious knows something we don&#8217;t.  We tell ourselves that we can&#8217;t possibly know some factoid, so we must experience it through communicating with a personality outside of our own.  We tune into the personality that best represents our definition of what &#8220;subconscious&#8221; is, and prepare ourselves to receive the information we already know about.</p>
<p>WWJD?  &#8220;What would Jesus do?&#8221; (for a klondike bar?).  Another example of personality tuning.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to share this link that I&#8217;ve had stored away for a long time.  It&#8217;s an exercise for &#8220;borrowing&#8221; someone else&#8217;s genius.  Basically, the question becomes, &#8220;What would a genius think?&#8221;, and develops an exercise for tuning into this genius personality.  <a href="http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm">http://www.winwenger.com/borrow1.htm</a></p>
<p>I may write on this topic some more, because I feel as though I&#8217;ve just skimmed over it.  Any questions, feel free to ask.</p>

					<p>Personal liberation is great.</p>
<p>But I get stuck.  See, it turns out that everyone is already free.  So if I sit here and say that I can help free you, then I&#8217;m lying.  You <em>are</em> free.</p>
<p>But I see a lot of people using their freedom to enslave themselves.  Then they cry because they are enslaved.  What am I suppose to do?  Help them to stop crying?  The only way to stop them from crying is to get them to realize they are already free.  But to get them to realize they are already free, they must free themselves from their own enslavement.  So I have to tell them that they aren&#8217;t free.  But they are.</p>
<p>If I tell you, &#8220;The only way to become free is to strive for truth in all things&#8221;, then that is nice.  It&#8217;s a nice little statement, which is very useful.  But it&#8217;s a lie.  And very hypocritical at that&#8230; I&#8217;m lying about striving for truth!</p>
<p>But if I tell you, &#8220;You are already free&#8221;, it is true.  But it&#8217;s not useful to you.  You are suffering, you feel enslaved, and you want to be free.  What good is it to know that you are already free?  If anything, that makes it worse!</p>
<p>So I must do the compassionate thing&#8230; I must lie in order to help out.  Everyone is free, but a lot of us don&#8217;t realize it.</p>
<p>So how do you free yourself?  Fuck if I know :-).</p>
<p>Personal liberation is one of those things you gotta do for yourself.  There&#8217;s a lot of bullshit out there&#8230; including this post :-).  Some idiot thinks he has things figured out, and wants to share his distorted perspective with the world.  That&#8217;s life.   Every person you see is expressing their personalized slavery.  So join them if you want&#8230; though I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it :-P.</p>
<p>People who make sense only make sense because they reflect the things that make sense in our own head.  Someone doesn&#8217;t help us or hurt us&#8230; we help and hurt ourself.  The person is only a reflection of this self-process.</p>
<p>So how do you free yourself anyway?  I suppose the best way would be to stop taking shit so seriously.  And don&#8217;t take that advice too seriously either :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one big contradiction.  If I tell you how to free yourself, then how can you be free of my instruction?  Teaching is enslavement.  If I give advice, then are you free to not take my advice?  Or do you feel compelled to take my advice?  If you don&#8217;t take my advice, you are enslaved, and if you take my advice, you are enslaved.  Good luck! <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> (don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s a third path :-P).</p>
<p>Avoid people who know what they&#8217;re talking about.  They ruin truth.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m guilty of it&#8230; sorry :-P.</p>
