		<div id="post_7767" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">&quot;@somefatguy: &#039;But if someone wants to live beyond what the repetitive mind has to offer, then duality is not necessary.&#039; i think if anyone were to try to live byond the &#039;repetitive mind&#039; as you call it they would simply go insane for lack of being able to filter information entering the brain and would there for not be able to tell the difference between right/wrong or real/false. This would cause their mind to collaspe under the strain of trying to sort through a million details at one time and would just cause them to snap.&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve lost a lot of interest in this thread, but I&#039;ll just respond to you Linked. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really sure how you came up with that, but I&#039;ll try to explain as best as I can. <br />
Basically, we are controlled by our minds, we think we are our minds, and we can&#039;t really stop them. Try to just sit still and stop all thoughts completely. Pretty hard right? The second you notice that every thing is silent the mind comments on it. <br />
So, with that said, one of the biggest goals that a seeker of enligtenment must achieve is to control his mind. As I said earlier, you can switch it on or off by your own free will once you are able to control it. And with that control, you would be able to live normally and blissfully whenever you want. <br />
<br />
Now you say a person like this would go insane, here is how I would see the mind work in this situation. If the person who controlled his mind at the time had it off, then whatever good or bad that passed by wouldn&#039;t affect him. He wouldn&#039;t think about it, and he wouldn&#039;t worry. He would just watch and observe whatever action in life just occurred. Now let&#039;s say he had it on, his mind would be just as keen, if not keener than it was before he was able to control it; keener because it finally has gotten rest after many years. He would just see the event occur, and label it good or bad once again. There would be no problem. It&#039;s not like the mind that this person has would have forgotten every thing it has learned in it&#039;s lifetime. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know what you mean by the mind having to decipher millions of bits of information at once though Linked. If you want to be realistic though, there are trillions and trillions of things happening all at once out of our mind&#039;s view. And even in our minds view, possibly millions of things are happening. Perhaps  2,000 dust particles are flying by, a cat is jumping on a couch, a TV is on. Even so, the mind is pretty tunnel visioned really. It usually on focusses on pinpoint occurrences. It wouldn&#039;t get confused by all the things happening, it would simply ignore all of them. <br />
<br />
Really interesting video about that Donnie Darko thing. :)</div>
