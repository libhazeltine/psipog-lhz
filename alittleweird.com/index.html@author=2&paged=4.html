					<p>If all my decisions can be traced back to the automated processing of my subconscious&#8230; do I ever make real decisions?</p>
<p>Why do I even exist?  Why am I even aware of this moment?</p>
<p>Evolution, psychology, sociology, chemistry, physics&#8230; these disciplines outline a very clear message.  I can see the fear laced beneath the surface of the scientist&#8217;s dissertation.  The message is that we don&#8217;t exist.  Everything has been accounted for.  We know who, what, when, where, how.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see beauty in this system&#8230; I see amazing beauty.  Numbers can do amazing things; I get it.  But they&#8217;re still just numbers.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fun exercise: identify something you feel is sacred.  Maybe God, or music, or poetry, or a religious text, or reproduction, or relationships, or family, or perpetual motion, or secret government, or morality, or correctness, or cleanliness, or technology, or whatever.  Then, immerse yourself in it, and learn and experience everything about it.  Push yourself to the very brink.  Do not deny yourself any piece of relevance.</p>
<p>What will you learn?  The object itself was never sacred.  It&#8217;s perceived sacred-ness was a projection from the inner workings of your own mind.  There is no such thing as &#8220;sacred&#8221;.  It&#8217;s just your mind.</p>
<p>Everywhere I look, all I see is mind.  This computer is mind.  This music is mind.  This air.  These feelings.  I cannot escape mind.</p>
<p>I know I am not mind&#8230; but I can&#8217;t not use mind in order to search for myself.  And I can&#8217;t not use mind to express this.</p>
<p>The point is this:</p>
<p>Mind is not real.  By extension, reality is not real.  I&#8217;ve been chasing my shadow, for a glimpse of my face.  Is Nothing worthwhile?  Will Nothing satisfy my thirst for existence?</p>
<p>Ramblings.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Happy 11-11!  And now for something completely different&#8230;</p>
<p>If you study philosophy, then you are familiar with the collection of beliefs that fall under the label of &#8220;Determinism&#8221;.  Determinism states that everything in the world is simply cause and effect, and we can predict the future with 100% accuracy if we know the position of every little thing involved.  We just have to apply the math, and calculate the result.  The ability to &#8220;make decisions&#8221; is simply an illusion - your decisions aren&#8217;t an exercise of free-will, they are just the results of all the different chemicals in your head, and electricity bouncing around.</p>
<p>Determinism is anti-intuitive, because when we make decisions, it <em>feels</em> like we are making a choice.  It doesn&#8217;t feel like our choice is just a result of the different neurons in our brain, and chemicals pumping through our blood stream.  It feels like we are genuinely making a conscious decision - that we have free-will.</p>
<p>The argument of Free-Will vs. Determinism is a popular amoung philosophers.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to solve the riddle with this post, but I do believe that <a href="2008/10/14/introduction-to-quantum-physics/index.html">quantum physics</a> provides us with a framework for making the argument for free-will, based on our scientific understanding of reality.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;God does not play dice with the Universe.&#8221;</em> - Albert Einstein, arguing in favor of Determinism.</p>
<p>Einstein, like many scientists at the time, believed that reality was deterministic.  He believed that scientists would eventually be able to figure out every math formula for how things work, and given enough knowledge, could calculate the exact future.  What instigated Einstein to make such an argument in the first place, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation">Copenhager interpretation</a> of quantum physics, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Uncertainty principle</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of quantum physics, it was hard to make the case for free-will.  Sir Isaac Newton showed us that objects in reality move according to mathmatical formulas.  When you throw a ball in the air, it has a parabolic curve, and we can plot the location of the ball, and predict where it will land.  Sure, there are unknown processes in the world that still needed to be discovered, but it was believed that it was just a matter of time before we had a formula for everything.</p>
<p>The Uncertainty principle changed that.  It&#8217;s discovery told us that we could never reach the holy-land of Determinism.  We could never learn all the formulas, and predict the future with 100% accuracy, because reality wouldn&#8217;t let us.  Uncertainty wasn&#8217;t due to our ignorance - it was hard-coded into reality itself.</p>
<p>While scientists try to remain objective, one couldn&#8217;t help but see the philisophical implications.  If Uncertainty is true, then reality isn&#8217;t deterministic, and there just might be room for free-will in the laboratory.  If free-will does exist, then it is exercised inside the realm of quantum physics.  And if we have free-will, then <strong>consciousness must operate on a quantum level</strong>.</p>

					<p>Not that many people know that a second Scientific Revolution happened in the 1920&#8217;s.  It was during this time that scientists like Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and others had finally started putting together a deeper understanding of our world on a sub-atomic level.  A lot of important discoveries had been made up until that point, but in 1925, a new scientific field of study had emerged out of equations and experiments: Quantum Physics.</p>
<p>It sure sounds cool!  &#8220;Quantum Physics&#8221;.  Ooh yeah :-D.  But is this just another inaccessible scientific body of knowledge - only privy to those who understand the jargon of the University professors?  No!  Quantum Physics might sound a little intimidating, but it&#8217;s actually pretty easy to gain a basic understanding of what happened in the 1920&#8217;s, and how it impacts our understanding of reality.</p>
<p>Prior to this Revolution, humanity had a Newtonian outlook on reality.  This world-view was invented in the 1600&#8217;s, by Sir Isaac Newton, and stated that things are basically mechanical.  When you push something, you are putting a force on it.  When you drop something, it falls because the Earth has a gravitational field&#8230; pulling objects towards the center.  If you throw something up in the air, it will curve in a parabolic arc - eventually falling back to the ground.  Things accelerate, and move, and everything behaves according to what math tells us.  There is a formula for how everything works.  <strong>Reality is just one big machine.</strong></p>
<p>When we started to zoom in on things, we expected to see this same mechanical world.  We zoomed into the cell, and saw miniature machines.  Then zoomed in more, to the molecule, and saw little gears.  Then even more: in 1913, Niels Bohr came up with his famous depiction of the atom:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="wp-content/uploads/2008/10/atom.jpg" title="Bohr’s Atom"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2008/10/atom.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Bohr’s Atom" /></a></p>
<p>Marbles!  Brilliant!  Looks like Newton was right - everything is just mechanical.  Everything is just a bunch of complicated machines, working in amazing ways - but still just machines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand this mindset.  This is the mindset that a lot of people have about reality today.  If you ask someone to draw an atom, they will likely draw the 1913 version above.  The only problem is that it isn&#8217;t 1913.  It&#8217;s 2008.</p>
<p>The funny thing is&#8230; if you zoom in a little bit more&#8230; everything seems to just fall apart.  The normal rules about reality - the normal common-sense-Netwonian rules - don&#8217;t work.  Not only do they fail, but they fail magnificantly.</p>
<p>This is what an atom looks like in 2008:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2008/10/newatom.jpg" title="2008 Atom"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2008/10/newatom.thumbnail.jpg" alt="2008 Atom" /></a></p>
<p>What, no marbles?  My goodness&#8230; that almost looks as though it&#8217;s some sort ball of energy&#8230; <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So what happened?  What changed our understanding in 1925, that made us re-think everything?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">The Uncertainty Principle</a></p>
<p>Scientists saw those marbles, and thought: &#8220;Well gee, if I know exactly where the marble is, and what direction it&#8217;s moving in, then I can predict exactly how the atom is going to behave.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when they tried to find where the marble was, they couldn&#8217;t figure out what direction it was moving in.  And when they could figure out the direction, they suddenly couldn&#8217;t figure out where it was!   No matter how hard they tried, they couldn&#8217;t figure out both pieces of information (location + direction) at the same time.</p>
<p>So what?  It sounds like we just need better equipment, right?  The Uncertainty Principle changed that - it stated that it&#8217;s <em>physically impossible</em> to know both the location and direction at the same time.  It&#8217;s a law etched into our reality.</p>
<p>Why was this a fantastic deal in the 1920&#8217;s?  Because the mechanical world that scientists have grown and loved over the previous 300 years was shattered.  Things were no longer machines.  There was divine Uncertainty, hard-coded into reality itself.  And Uncertainty is scary.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s taken me about 18 months, but I&#8217;ve finally come full circle with my thoughts about the lottery&#8230;</p>
<p>When I first started trying to win the lottery, I believed that I needed to do so through some sort of understanding.  A lottery-nirvana.  This evolved into trying out different techniques related to consciousness.  Altering my belief structures, trancing, precognition, intention manifestation, etc.</p>
<p>As those techniques (mostly) failed, I began to think that science was the way to go.  Think of an experiment, go through the motion, and be done with it.  Plug and chug.  I had turned away from the consciousness-based approach, and thought a more mechanical way would work.  I looked at winning as a result of a series of successful experiments.</p>
<p>The problem with designing and executing experiments was finally realized and expressed in my post, <a href="2008/08/17/pseudoscience/index.html">Pseudoscience</a>.  The scientific method can only help us so much&#8230; but how do you turn a microscope on itself?</p>
<p>So I return to my first thoughts, with a more robust sense of direction.  There is no mechanical way to win the lottery; from a machine&#8217;s perspective, the lottery drawing is a chaotic process.  No amount of formulae can predict the future.  Our destination is a result of decision - not determinism.  The only way to win the lottery is to plug into a decision-making machine: Consciousness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still at a loss on how I&#8217;m going to do this&#8230; perhaps that&#8217;s why I continue to fail.  I&#8217;m trying to find the middle path.  I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I haven&#8217;t posted in over a month.  I had a revelation, which had the effect of removing a lot of my motivation for expressing myself.  In fact, I feel very little drive to make this post&#8230; but I feel I should at least get my words on paper for my own sake - and maybe the few reading can provide insight as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survival of the fitest&#8221; describes so much.  I&#8217;ve obviously read about evolution before&#8230; but it never really hit home until recently.  Everything we see around us is only there because it self-replicates.  The only things that persist are those things that can adapt to their environment, and reproduce.  I&#8217;m not just talking about biology - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">ideas and thoughts</a> are the same way.  In fact, all of life as we know it is a result of self-replication and adaptation.</p>
<p>Now of course, I&#8217;ve thought about evolution in the past, and agreed with it mostly.  I&#8217;ve known the concept of a &#8220;meme&#8221; for years.  It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m talking about any real new idea here.  It&#8217;s just the level of appreciation that&#8217;s changed.  In the past, it was an interesting idea that I touched upon every once in a while, that remained in the back of my mind.  But recently it&#8217;s been thrusted into the forefront, and become a cornerstone of my understanding of what I experience on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>This actually depressed me for quite a while.  It was like beating a game&#8230; yes, it feels great to be done with it, but at the same time it&#8217;s a little bittersweet.  I was happy that I understood a lot of my experiences and beliefs&#8230; but at the same time, depressed that I could no longer be intellectually honest with myself about holding on to stupid ideas.</p>
<p>My depression was eventually overcome.  My subconscious sorted it out for me.</p>
<p>Self-replication explains nearly everything about our human experience.  On a biological, psychological, and philosophical level.  Self-replication is so powerful because it has <em>persisting power</em>.  Everyone has random thoughts, and does random things&#8230; but if those things don&#8217;t persist, then in the long run, you really won&#8217;t notice them.  They will eventually fizzle out.  For example, how many people believe that the Earth is flat?  Not too many.  The idea isn&#8217;t persistent.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine the most persistent thing.  What could adapt and self-replicate the <em>best</em>?  I started listing different organisims in my mind, playing out a long term simulation in my head.  I listed different religions, and my knowledge about how they persisted and adapted to the populace.  Then I thought about just general ideas, and their ability to persist.  Mathematics should persist for a long time&#8230; math is considered a universal language.  What else&#8230; what else&#8230;</p>
<p>Then it hit me: truth.  Truth is the only thing that escapes this need of persistence.  What I mean by that is: gravity will last longer than the human race.  If something is true, then something is true&#8230; permanently.  Truth doesn&#8217;t adapt&#8230; and it doesn&#8217;t self-replicate.  The things that do adapt and self-replicate are constantly trying to align themselves with truth - for survival - but truth doesn&#8217;t really have that problem.</p>
<p>This removed my depression.  But it also removed my desire to share my thoughts with the world.  Who cares if someone disagrees with me?  And who cares if someone agrees with me?  Truth transcends persistence.  So everything is OK.</p>
<p>In the past I felt a need to get my ideas out&#8230; but probably because I was convinced by someone else that it&#8217;s good to get your ideas out.  Because they were getting <em>their</em> ideas out - to me.  The idea of &#8220;you need to express yourself&#8221; is just a self-replicating thought.  If I sit here and preach that everyone needs to get a blog, and tell the world their thoughts&#8230; then those who I convince to do so will spread the same idea&#8230; telling their readers to get a blog, and tell the world their thoughts.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what my line of reasoning is for why people should express themselves&#8230; just the more effective the reason is, the more the &#8220;express yourself&#8221; idea will self-replicate.</p>
<p>But none of that matters now.  Truth trumps all that.  Do I need to convince you that gravity exists?  Uh, no.  A truth will exist whether the conceptualization of that truth is self-replicating or not.  It&#8217;s not so much &#8220;who gives a shit&#8221; as it&#8217;s &#8220;truth has <em>already</em> won the fight&#8221;.</p>
<p>So&#8230; with that said&#8230; perhaps you can see why I feel no motivation for expressing my thoughts (as much as I used to, at least).</p>

					<p>Parapsychology is commonly regarded as pseudoscience - it is attacked for its lack of adherence to the scientific method.  This is a problem - because they are right.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s outline the problem:</p>
<p>We are trying to discover and learn things about reality.  We are seeking genuine, reality-based truth.</p>
<p>What are the problems we need to overcome to do that?  Wild theories from armchair philosophers.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">Confirmation bias</a>.  Self-deception.</p>
<p>1. Wild theories are easy - let&#8217;s focus on personal experience.  If you haven&#8217;t experienced something, then you have no business in trying to make sense of it.  Let&#8217;s just throw out the ideas of the world being <a href="http://www.cs.williams.edu/~lindsey/myths/myths_12.html">created on the back of a turtle</a>, since no one actually saw it happen.</p>
<p>2. Confirmation bias is a little harder - let&#8217;s develop intelligent tests that can falsify our ideas.  If we develop and execute tests that can disprove our idea, then we can be more sure that our idea is true.</p>
<p>3. Self-deception is tough.  Well, if something happened, then it should be able to happen again.  So, we should tell everyone what we experienced and tested.  If other people reproduce our results, then we can be sure we aren&#8217;t deceiving ourselves.  Or at least, if we are deceiving ourselves, then so is everyone else who is seeing the same thing we are.</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan!  Actually, it&#8217;s a revolutionary idea that transformed the human race - it&#8217;s called the &#8220;scientific method&#8221;.  Start with personal experience, followed by experiments to try and prove our ideas false, followed by peer-review.</p>
<p>So why don&#8217;t we use this for researching the paranormal?  It turns out that&#8217;s very hard.  Well&#8230; maybe we can simplify things.</p>
<p>What if we just focus on personal experience?  Confirmation bias and self-deception is overrated anyways, so just throw that out the window.  A lot of online communities take this position - including PsiPog (when it was open)!</p>
<p>What happens?  Eventually, the community fails at discovering genuine truth.  When a community&#8217;s focus is solely on personal experience, then it <em>rewards</em> confirmation bias and self-deception.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias manifests itself as a bunch of people sitting around, doing nothing.  After all, there&#8217;s no need to test anything when you have it all figured out.  The scientific method states that we should be trying to prove our ideas false, in order to avoid confirmation bias.  But if the community throws that idea out the window, then why test anything?  We have it figured out, so there&#8217;s no need to <em>do</em> anything.</p>
<p>Self-deception manifests itself as varying levels of delusion.  Did you just blow a hole in someone&#8217;s shield?  Better check with the referee!  Awesome, you did!  You are now level 98.  You&#8217;ll be flying around and blowing up planets in no time.  Welcome to fluff-ville.</p>
<p>Without dealing with confirmation bias and self-deception, we will forever be doomed to <a href="2007/11/14/i-dont-miss-psipog/index.html">apathetic inactivity</a> and fluff bunnies.</p>
<p>So why can&#8217;t we just use the scientific method to research parapsychology?  To answer that, let&#8217;s use our imagination for a second.</p>
<p>We need to deal with wild theories, confirmation bias, and self-deception.  We&#8217;ve come up with three solutions to these problems, labeled collectively as the &#8220;scientific method&#8221;.  Is it possible that there exists a property about reality that will naturally &#8220;evade&#8221; discovery based on the three solutions we&#8217;ve provided?  Phrased another way: do the three solutions guarantee that we will discover <em>every</em> truth about reality?  And another way: could a real phenomenon exist that, when the scientific method is applied to it, makes the phenomenon itself go away?</p>
<p>Now, at this point, I&#8217;m not saying that these types of &#8220;evading phenomenon&#8221; exist.  I&#8217;m just saying, is it <em>possible</em> that they exist?  The answer has to be: yes!</p>
<p>With that said, I believe parapsychology has become a grab-bag of these such phenomenon.  Telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, DMILs, OBEs, ghosts, aliens, precognition, etc.  These are all very strange things, that normally wouldn&#8217;t be grouped together.  But they share a common thread: they naturally evade discovery when applying the three solutions outlined above.</p>
<p>So, when someone claims that parapsychology is nothing but mere pseudoscience&#8230; I have to agree.  Except without the condescending attitude :-).  I believe that parapsychology is, by <em>definition</em>, the collection of phenomenon that, by their very nature, evade discovery when applying the scientific method.  So of course it&#8217;s pseudoscience!</p>
<p>Now, after all that, saying something is &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that it isn&#8217;t true.  I definitely believe in telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, DMILs, OBEs, &#8220;ghosts&#8221; (in a sense) and precognition, with some curious skepticism for aliens.  The label of &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; isn&#8217;t an insult.</p>
<p>But just because we are throwing parts of the scientific method out the window, by necessity, doesn&#8217;t mean we can just do whatever we want.  In order to ensure our pursuit of truth is legitimate, we must create new solutions for the problem of confirmation bias and self-deception - perhaps on a case-by-case basis.  If the scientific method&#8217;s solution to these problems will cause the phenomenon we are studying to naturally &#8220;evade&#8221; discovery, then we must come up with new solutions.  Not just toss the scientific method out the window and hope things work out.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed my results from the past 17 months, concerning the lottery.</p>
<p>I devised a way to measure how &#8220;close&#8221; I get to the winning numbers.  My formula for measuring this &#8220;closeness&#8221; is somewhat arbitrary, but there is no correct formula, so it works as good as any.  In calculating the odds, I measure the &#8220;closeness&#8221; of all possible tickets - then see how many tickets are just as &#8220;close&#8221; as my ticket.</p>
<p>For the curious programmers, you can see my C program for measuring &#8220;closeness&#8221; here: <a href="wp-content/uploads/2008/07/score_calc.c" title="Lottery Score Calculator">Lottery Score Calculator Source Code</a></p>
<p>And for the results of my drawings:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted three of my best results.  Of particular interest is the drawing that scored 1 in 1091.  The winning numbers were 04 17 26 46 56 [25], and I picked 06 18 29 44 52 [27].  So close! <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>As you can see, a lot of my drawings are crap.  But it&#8217;s those few gems that are so amazingly close, that it&#8217;s impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>Enough of all this bullshit - it&#8217;s time to resume training!  I&#8217;ve resumed my OBE and EM training, and it feels good to <em>do</em> something :-).  I&#8217;ve decided to start holding weekly practice sessions with the geiger counter as well.  Every Sunday, at 7pm EST, feel free to meet in the <a href="geiger-game.php.html">geiger counter chat room</a>, and we can mess around collectively with the geiger counter.  I&#8217;ve added a timer to the page that counts down to the next practice session, so you know exactly when it will happen.</p>
<p>So, see you Sunday! <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
