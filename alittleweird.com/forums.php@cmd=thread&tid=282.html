<br />
I am in a 1991 powder blue Honda Accord about to enter a highway. I am traveling up hill and notice a shooting star. How nice. Then another, even better. Soon the sky is full of shooting stars, but they are moving around at neck breaking speeds and taking 90, 180 and 270 degree turns. Also the &#039;UFO&#039; become larger and larger not as if expanding but rather as if they are closing in. They start becoming dangerously close to the highway as I become dangerously close to a concrete wall. I swirve to miss only taking my eyes off the celestial light show for one moment and they are gone. Now for the longest time I thought they were some being from space, hi ET... I decided the only way I was going to know is if I were to meditate and replay that night over and over. Finally I noticed somthing. There was a shadow that resembled a person about 1500ft on the edge of a very large rocky hill beside the highway.<br />
I tried to feel any energy that was emitted and in fact I discovered that perhaps this was some sort of abnormally &#039;gifted&#039; person training in a form of psionics.<br />

What time of day?  No other cars on the road?  Did you notice this shadow during the actual experience, or only after the fact when you meditated on the memory?  Any sounds?  Did you pull over?  How clear were the &quot;shooting stars&quot; - how large were they in the sky?  Very very tiny?<br />

your story also has a certain flare to it, that of a story as opposed to an account. again, im not calling you a liar, but i would wonder what the absolute &quot;facts&quot; of the account were vs. what the experience has become in your mind.<br />

to this point in my life ive come very close to adoption of the &quot;anything is possible&quot; ideal, so id think that, sure, for someone to pull off that feat is definitely in the realm of possibility. but are you asking because you think thats what happened or because youd like that to happen?<br />

If someone really could do all that, and they really had thought about putting it up for all the world to see, and they really expected to get lots of believers out of it, what do you think he would do?

Then again, if somebody did put on a show, is it possible he&#039;s part of some religious group that&#039;s forbidden to share the knowledge? I wouldn&#039;t be surprised. First thing I thought of was Druids, even though they don&#039;t really have anything to do with this topic (I think).</div>
