Well, on Friday I got the feeling that in the upcoming bball game, this one girl would get hurt and bust her knee before the first half was over. She did, which is what got me thinking. I don&#039;t really get any pictures other than my imagination (I think). Lucky for me I told someone what I thought, and she thought I was pessimistic and funny.<br />
<br />
Do you all usually get more random premonitions for bad stuff? That seems to be the way it is for me.<br />
<br />
And to further increase the scope of this thread, what are some theories on the future you all have? Like multiple futures and we pick one, one future and we have to go by it, and of course the loop or whatever that must occur when predicting it.<br />

For example, when I occasionally spontaiously predict stuff (I think something and know it will happen), I usually get this warm &quot;whoosh&quot; feeling in my chest to shoulders.</div>That happens to me during telepathy games with friends. While trying to interpret what they&#039;re sending me(I&#039;m usually the receiver; I have a &quot;knack&quot; for it, according to them), I will start getting that &quot;whoosh&quot; feeling when I&#039;m on the right track. Let&#039;s say they&#039;re sending me the thought of an apple. &quot;Round&quot; is usually the first thing that comes to mind: Slight &quot;whoosh&quot;. Next, I notice that it&#039;s red: Another &quot;whoosh&quot;. I follow that pattern until I fully understand the thought. It&#039;s like I&#039;m reassuring myself, haha.<br />

And last thing- How do you know if you just predicted the future, or influenced it?</div>Good question. Honestly, I have no idea. There was only one time I know that I predicted rather than influenced, and that&#039;s just because I prevented it from happening. And also, my mother predicted the same thing at the same moment I did. Most of my predictions come in dreams, and I don&#039;t realize that they were more than dreams until I get major deja vu. </div>

For example, when I occasionally spontaiously predict stuff (I think something and know it will happen), I usually get this warm &quot;whoosh&quot; feeling in my chest to shoulders.[/quote]
That happens to me during telepathy games with friends. While trying to interpret what they&#039;re sending me(I&#039;m usually the receiver; I have a &quot;knack&quot; for it, according to them), I will start getting that &quot;whoosh&quot; feeling when I&#039;m on the right track. Let&#039;s say they&#039;re sending me the thought of an apple. &quot;Round&quot; is usually the first thing that comes to mind: Slight &quot;whoosh&quot;. Next, I notice that it&#039;s red: Another &quot;whoosh&quot;. I follow that pattern until I fully understand the thought. It&#039;s like I&#039;m reassuring myself, haha.

And last thing- How do you know if you just predicted the future, or influenced it?[/quote]
Good question. Honestly, I have no idea. There was only one time I know that I predicted rather than influenced, and that&#039;s just because I prevented it from happening. And also, my mother predicted the same thing at the same moment I did. Most of my predictions come in dreams, and I don&#039;t realize that they were more than dreams until I get major deja vu.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
