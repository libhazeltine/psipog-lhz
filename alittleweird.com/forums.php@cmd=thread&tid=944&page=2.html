		<div id="post_16619" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">My my, there&#039;s quite a bit more than I expected to find in here these past few months. Allow me to express my opinions on the startup of a new community, and psionics in general<br />
<br />
First, before I write this, I would like to apologize for leaving without notice during the last attempt to sort of &quot;re-start&quot; the psionics community. However it was also my mistake to get involved in the first place. I should have mentioned that I am NOT a disciplined person at all, and at 21, I am just learning the importance of this. I find it simply unfair that I had left (without notice anyway) when such a community was in it&#039;s embryonic stage (Though I dare not claim that I alone could have saved it). However, my leaving was primarily due to some realizations I had regarding psionics. Which leads me to my meaty meaty article.... mmm<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, most of my &quot;practice&quot; was not online, but with other people. I&#039;ve attended online sessions in the past, true. But for me and maybe others, it was nothing like learning with another person, or having a special place to do it. Computers are a tool. They&#039;re a good tool for talking to people over the net, and getting clarity from others on this stuff, but only sometimes. We are people. Separated by vast distances, timezones, dayjobs, oceans, you name it. As for clarity, well, just as a certain some-people said, &quot;The blind leading the blind&quot; should explain everything. <br />
<br />
Emotion is a key thing in psionics. But why? I know it&#039;s supposed to be a mental energy and all, and emotions having direct influence makes sense on that level, but I see something else. I see motivation, that drive that pushes people to do anything. I&#039;ve seen a lack of motivation too. It&#039;s depressing, at least to a degree, to see someone give up on anything. It&#039;s happened here in other communities, but there&#039;s nothing truly wrong with it. Unless you have expectations for someone out there to swoop in and save you. That&#039;s asking for a bit much.<br />
<br />
A fine example of an emotional-psionic event is a PK party. Whether or not it&#039;s hosted by the famous Jack Houck, there is usually some small-or-otherwise success at these. Now, it could be a trick of mind, or the host, but most phenomena occurs under an emotional circumstance. This again comes from the atmosphere. It&#039;s an exciting atmosphere where you think something strange will happen, at your own will no less! But you don&#039;t always need another person. If you&#039;re like me, a quiet place you made special will be the only thing you need. <br />
<br />
But we make a community to connect and feel the comradery of group practice. To feel hope through the success of others out there. You may disagree, but it will never be the same being in the same space as another person. Web-cams and audio chats are an improvement, sure. But it just doesn&#039;t replace a real person, or a real place. At least for practicing anyway.<br />
<br />
This reason alone does not negate the need for a community, or disallow it, but it instead shows such a thing isn&#039;t entirely necessary. An online community is a fantastic place to share discoveries, of course. But when you think &quot;I want to practice psionics like in the old days!&quot; continuing and saying &quot;But I need a community!&quot; wont move things much farther. <br />
<br />
We are the blind leading the blind, but being together wont help us see where we are going. Best make like ants. You know how ants find things? They don&#039;t rely on smell to find food from a distance, they spread out everywhere. Once they find themselves a nice chunk of food, they run back home to tell everyone, and mark their trail with a special scent. Sure this metaphor might have a bit too much detail, but I say it illustrates what we ought to do.<br />
<br />
This might seem difficult to apply to a more abstract concept like this one. But I have a suggestion. Stop calling this psionics! <br />
<br />
Really it&#039;s about a breakdown of hierarchy, so we can build a new one from the ground up, with the same pieces. There&#039;s a group of people, called &quot;Chaos Magicians&quot;. Along with some eye-rolling attempts at confusing people, they do have a core idea in mind. One way to put it would be a &quot;No Truth&quot; attitude. In chaos magic, usually someone creates a belief to practice magic by, whether it be rituals or something else. We don&#039;t really know what psionics, or magic is, yet. Some might say it&#039;s a specific set of abilities describing certain effects. But they overlap. You might say psionics is more scientific in nature than magic. But this isn&#039;t true either. There are people who look at magic scientifically and psionics/psychism spiritually.<br />
<br />
Although magic is often associated with a sort of &quot;ritual influence&quot; over things, there are claims (remember, claims) of much more &quot;active&quot; forces that effect the physical world. Though the magicians interest is typically of a spiritual nature, in books discussing magic you can find quite a few claims of things resembling psi, telekinetic movement, telepathy and even some rather insane things like raising the dead (Yes, there really are books claiming this). There are even a few things that you can learn about on psipog, that have roots in occultism, or some eastern idea (such as dowsing or reiki, respectively). <br />
<br />
By dissolving these notions of what is supposed to be what, we are free to do as we please. It doesn&#039;t matter if you think you can shoot lightning or whatever. If you haven&#039;t seen yourself do it yet, you&#039;re not going to try and save or hurt someone with something you cant do (And to be honest, even if you knew you could, you probably wouldn&#039;t). But you&#039;re likely to be more motivated, which will get you some results, and give you a feel for what&#039;s really real and what&#039;s not. It&#039;s how my first year of real practice went. But then someone told me some things I believed in might not be real. I began to question everything, and decided the best thing to do was to pick a down-to-earth belief. Things started to slow down drastically for me, and instead psionics practice became a research effort to find out what things were real, and what things weren&#039;t. Just for a subconscious seal of approval.<br />
<br />
So I might have digressed just a little, but here it is all summed up.<br />
<br />
1: Online communities aren&#039;t necessary for you to practice, and can be a distraction.<br />
<br />
2: Online communities tend to enforce a mindset<br />
<br />
What would my ideal community look like? Let me describe, based on the information I have typed for you...<br />
<br />
A number of people, connected through an internet group (perhaps a blog), would each create personal blogs about their practice with weird phenomena, particularly ones induced by the will of a person, in this case. In the main group page would be a list of each blogger. Everyone else in the group would be considered a &quot;reader&quot;. If a reader is to become a blogger on that list, then they must have a relatively unique approach to these abilities. If they do not have a unique approach, then they can vouch to be categorized with a similar blogger. They can call these abilties whatever they wish, but it would also be important for them to provide information on their methods, and successes. An update of once a week/month would be required to be on the &quot;current&quot; bloggers list, after that amount of time they would be on an &quot;old blogs&quot; list. Through this, we can hope to get a &quot;whole view&quot; of strange phenomena of this nature. It would have to be titled under something completely new, or something unifying (such as a magic, psionics, qi-gong &quot;everything&quot; group). The latter is most likely to work in gathering people.<br />
<br />
Now, I have no idea if this has been done before or not, or if such a thing exists already. But I think it can work. It attracts many different kinds of people, and everyone who chooses to speak, has a voice. It is worthy to note that this is a &quot;community&quot; of few bloggers. If it got to a certain size, another &quot;node&quot; would need to be created. Too many nodes? Increase node blogger capacity. This is to help organization mostly, as all other nodes would contain links to other nodes. But it also promotes closeness to fellow bloggers. Node managers would be able to recieve anonymous feedback, about which blogs are in need of attention, or which ones are really great, etc.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
As for myself, I am practicing on my own. Under that system, I really couldn&#039;t be an organizer. I could maybe be a weekly or monthly blogger, or something. But I&#039;m afraid I must reveal something. It doesn&#039;t really matter to me whether or not psionics &quot;dies&quot;. In my opinion psionics and magic/occult things are exactly the same, and have been around for thousands of years. The more dead or lost or mysterious something is, the more I become fascinated with it. A fun activity is to try looking back at all the posts here in the forum from years ago. It&#039;s a time capsule, and chances are you&#039;ve posted here before. For me it&#039;s a strange window into the past, that shows a former version of myself. <br />
<br />
If you want to contact me, my real email is &quot;imthejman14@yahoo.com&quot;. No alias this time. I&#039;d be willing to create a blog about my own practices, and it would probably encourage me. It&#039;s like a journal or something. I do have alot to say about psionics, some thoughts, some analogies, but I&#039;ll save that for the blog, or whoever wishes to hear it, provided you bring the salt. It&#039;s been fun here online, but for the most part, I&#039;m done waiting. <br />

Some resources on a few things mentioned here<br />
<br />
1: Elphas Levi&#039;s &quot;Key to the Mysteries&quot;<br />
 <a href="http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/Levi_Mysteries.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/Levi_Mysteries.pdf</a><br />
(look for things refering to &#039;magnetic fluid&#039;)<br />
(A book discussing magic that also claims some psionic feats)<br />
<br />
2: Sefer Yetzirah<br />
No website for this, as I couldn&#039;t find the whole book in digital form. It has some psionic things in it, but also alot of crazy stuff too.<span style="color: #808080;"> I sort of stopped reading after claiming they could influence a unborn child&#039;s qualities through sex after getting circumcised</span>. But it still has some things similar to psionics in it.<br />
<br />
3: <a href="http://www.chaosmatrix.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.chaosmatrix.org/">http://www.chaosmatrix.org/</a><br />
This place is pretty much where I learned about chaos magic and it&#039;s ideas, or lack thereof, or whatever. It&#039;s essentially a big mish-mosh  of all sorts of ideas. You might find something interesting here.</div>

There are even a few things that you can learn about on psipog, that have roots in occultism, or some eastern idea (such as dowsing or reiki, respectively). 

By dissolving these notions of what is supposed to be what, we are free to do as we please. It doesn&#039;t matter if you think you can shoot lightning or whatever. If you haven&#039;t seen yourself do it yet, you&#039;re not going to try and save or hurt someone with something you cant do (And to be honest, even if you knew you could, you probably wouldn&#039;t). But you&#039;re likely to be more motivated, which will get you some results, and give you a feel for what&#039;s really real and what&#039;s not. It&#039;s how my first year of real practice went. But then someone told me some things I believed in might not be real. I began to question everything, and decided the best thing to do was to pick a down-to-earth belief. Things started to slow down drastically for me, and instead psionics practice became a research effort to find out what things were real, and what things weren&#039;t. Just for a subconscious seal of approval.

So I might have digressed just a little, but here it is all summed up.

1: Online communities aren&#039;t necessary for you to practice, and can be a distraction.

2: Online communities tend to enforce a mindset

What would my ideal community look like? Let me describe, based on the information I have typed for you...

A number of people, connected through an internet group (perhaps a blog), would each create personal blogs about their practice with weird phenomena, particularly ones induced by the will of a person, in this case. In the main group page would be a list of each blogger. Everyone else in the group would be considered a &quot;reader&quot;. If a reader is to become a blogger on that list, then they must have a relatively unique approach to these abilities. If they do not have a unique approach, then they can vouch to be categorized with a similar blogger. They can call these abilties whatever they wish, but it would also be important for them to provide information on their methods, and successes. An update of once a week/month would be required to be on the &quot;current&quot; bloggers list, after that amount of time they would be on an &quot;old blogs&quot; list. Through this, we can hope to get a &quot;whole view&quot; of strange phenomena of this nature. It would have to be titled under something completely new, or something unifying (such as a magic, psionics, qi-gong &quot;everything&quot; group). The latter is most likely to work in gathering people.

Now, I have no idea if this has been done before or not, or if such a thing exists already. But I think it can work. It attracts many different kinds of people, and everyone who chooses to speak, has a voice. It is worthy to note that this is a &quot;community&quot; of few bloggers. If it got to a certain size, another &quot;node&quot; would need to be created. Too many nodes? Increase node blogger capacity. This is to help organization mostly, as all other nodes would contain links to other nodes. But it also promotes closeness to fellow bloggers. Node managers would be able to recieve anonymous feedback, about which blogs are in need of attention, or which ones are really great, etc.

However...

As for myself, I am practicing on my own. Under that system, I really couldn&#039;t be an organizer. I could maybe be a weekly or monthly blogger, or something. But I&#039;m afraid I must reveal something. It doesn&#039;t really matter to me whether or not psionics &quot;dies&quot;. In my opinion psionics and magic/occult things are exactly the same, and have been around for thousands of years. The more dead or lost or mysterious something is, the more I become fascinated with it. A fun activity is to try looking back at all the posts here in the forum from years ago. It&#039;s a time capsule, and chances are you&#039;ve posted here before. For me it&#039;s a strange window into the past, that shows a former version of myself. 

If you want to contact me, my real email is &quot;imthejman14@yahoo.com&quot;. No alias this time. I&#039;d be willing to create a blog about my own practices, and it would probably encourage me. It&#039;s like a journal or something. I do have alot to say about psionics, some thoughts, some analogies, but I&#039;ll save that for the blog, or whoever wishes to hear it, provided you bring the salt. It&#039;s been fun here online, but for the most part, I&#039;m done waiting.

Some resources on a few things mentioned here

1: Elphas Levi&#039;s &quot;Key to the Mysteries&quot;
http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/Levi_Mysteries.pdf
(look for things refering to &#039;magnetic fluid&#039;)
(A book discussing magic that also claims some psionic feats)

2: Sefer Yetzirah
No website for this, as I couldn&#039;t find the whole book in digital form. It has some psionic things in it, but also alot of crazy stuff too.[grey] I sort of stopped reading after claiming they could influence a unborn child&#039;s qualities through sex after getting circumcised[/grey]. But it still has some things similar to psionics in it.

3: [url=http://www.chaosmatrix.org/]http://www.chaosmatrix.org/[/url]
This place is pretty much where I learned about chaos magic and it&#039;s ideas, or lack thereof, or whatever. It&#039;s essentially a big mish-mosh  of all sorts of ideas. You might find something interesting here.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

All true what mrj said.<br />
About chaos magicians.. I encourage you to read about it, it&#039;s going to open your mind about a lot of things. Example: Some of them use cthulu based rituals..<br />
&quot;HA ha ha...what?&quot;<br />
And yes it does work, why wouldnt it?<br />
<br />
People used to create thoughtforms(shoggoths) by following a long ritual and ejaculating into a small box every day for a period of time.<br />
Wait didn&#039;t we create thoughtforms with our minds? By focusing?<br />
Didnt it get stronger the more consistently we formed it?<br />

<br />
Indeed, my interest has faded. It came back a couple of times, but didn&#039;t stick around very long. And here I am again. I haven&#039;t learned a whole lot the past couple years. At least, no concrete information. Though I still go without any real practical experience, I have learned a proper way for one to view things.<br />
An objective mindset is important. One should not cling too strongly to their current beliefs. Compare them. See what they have in common, why the one or the other may not be as logical, and most of all, what attracts you the most. This is a bit weird coming from me, since I&#039;m still pretty gullible, but it&#039;s an idea of how to go about.<br />
As mrj sort of said, there&#039;s not really one truth either. Everything can be interpreted in multiple ways, practiced using different methods, and we shouldn&#039;t group people by those things. We should see what unites them, how they can help each other out, and how we can collectively move forward and expand our little group, whose ideas are still being rejected by the larger part of society.<br />
<br />
Communities are good to have. Idiots in them, not so much.<br />
Having a group to talk to about the paranormal is really nice, especially if you have nobody in real life who shares this interest with you. They&#039;re also great places for sharing and debating information. However, there&#039;s usually a few people who dismiss any belief that doesn&#039;t match their own as &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot;. On the one hand, this is their opinion. On the other, they shouldn&#039;t be attacking others for not agreeing with them.<br />
Another point of concern is misinformation. In this field of knowledge it can be pretty hard to separate the true from the fake, or even from the so-called &quot;creepypasta&quot;, especially with so many different ideas and views flowing everywhere.<br />
For the above reasons, I&#039;d say the ideal community would have strict rules regarding respecting other beliefs, and active moderation too. One could say this oppresses the freedom within the community and makes people hesitant to create discussions, but if that&#039;s necessary to create a nice, respectful and above all sharing community, then it may just be a step that I&#039;ll have to take.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s right, I said it&#039;s a step <strong>I</strong> might have to take. You may also be wondering where I&#039;m going with this.<br />
Recently, I&#039;ve been dabbling in the occult a little bit. I&#039;ve also been slowly collecting PDFs, Word documents, infographics and other kinds of files regarding the paranormal. It&#039;s mostly occult, but there&#039;s also a few other systems in there, and I even came across a few that had been ripped off of PsiPog. My current library counts over a thousand files.<br />
It&#039;s a bit of a mess, so I though, &quot;hmm, there must be a better way to sort that&quot;. I came up with the idea of having an online library, and have been slowly working on that for the past few months.<br />
<br />
The library will be a central place for all paranormal-related information. Because of its illegal nature, and because we want the community to consist of fairly trustworthy individuals (at least at first), the registration system will be invite-based.<br />
We haven&#039;t really looked at the addition of a forum yet, but I think it would be really nice to have a forum where the members can interact with each other, share their opinions, experiences, and help each other out.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if any of you are interested, but it may just be possible to turn this into the community Trick, mrj and others have described. The community won&#039;t be there to hold your hand as you take your steps, but instead will be there to reinforce your trust in those steps, give them more power, and make them more pleasurable to make.<br />
It would also be really neat if some of you would be willing to write a few articles regarding psionics to throw into the library. From what I can see, there&#039;s very little informational books, PDFs, etc. on the subject, so any additions would be nice!<br />
<br />
Pfff, I kind of forgot whether that was all I wanted to say, or if there was more. I may come back to it later then, but for now, I&#039;d like to hear your opinions on this. I&#039;ve never dealt with making a community before, and what better place to ask for opinions and ideas than a community wanting, well, a community?<br />
