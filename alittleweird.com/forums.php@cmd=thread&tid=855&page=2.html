antimatter is a big part of what the LHC is for, but there&#039;s more than just that. for example, it&#039;ll prove/disprove the theory of the Higgs boson (believed to be the source of mass). and yes, it does make dark matter as well (though I&#039;m not sure if dark matter and black hole are actually linked).<br />

According to standard physics, it wouldn&#039;t create black holes, but certain extensions of the standard system point to the contrary. Even so, it&#039;s been proved that it wouldn&#039;t actually be that harmful; the black holes would collapse, like you said.<br />

		<div id="post_16109" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yup Akio is right.<br />
<br />
Matter is made of energy and therefore, the matter-energy/energy-matter switch can be done at any time given the right amount of energy. The thing is: The only way we know of turning energy to matter and that&#039;s via a particle accelerator. It&#039;s used to create elements (or particles) that would be too unstable to exist in nature. Using the accelerators, we can create them. Although they only exist for a fraction of a second before going out again, the accelerators have the required technology to examine their characteristics, if only slightly.<br />
<br />
Although you&#039;re right in a way: matter (or energy) cannot be created. Like Antoine Lavoisier said, nothing is created or destroyed; everything is transformed.<br />
<br />
But it can be generated with enough energy.<br />
<br />
Akio&#039;s equation is right too. E=mc^2 is the one to turn matter to energy (Nuclear bombs, anyone?) and if you do a bit of simple math, you get m=E/c^2 In other words, to create say, one kilogram of matter, you need approximately 89,875,517,900,000,000 Joules of energy. (Yeah, that&#039;s more than the energy released by one thousand atomic bombs...)</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_16109">Yup Akio is right.

Matter is made of energy and therefore, the matter-energy/energy-matter switch can be done at any time given the right amount of energy. The thing is: The only way we know of turning energy to matter and that&#039;s via a particle accelerator. It&#039;s used to create elements (or particles) that would be too unstable to exist in nature. Using the accelerators, we can create them. Although they only exist for a fraction of a second before going out again, the accelerators have the required technology to examine their characteristics, if only slightly.

Although you&#039;re right in a way: matter (or energy) cannot be created. Like Antoine Lavoisier said, nothing is created or destroyed; everything is transformed.

But it can be generated with enough energy.

Akio&#039;s equation is right too. E=mc^2 is the one to turn matter to energy (Nuclear bombs, anyone?) and if you do a bit of simple math, you get m=E/c^2 In other words, to create say, one kilogram of matter, you need approximately 89,875,517,900,000,000 Joules of energy.

as for me i&#039;ll believe that if 2012 is the year its because of the higher power&#039;s words not ours or the mayans or anyone else and also why would this higher power tell us when the human race will cease to exist on earth? if he this higher power did that people would start killing others and ask to be spared right before life ceases to exist.<br />

As for the bacteria: We still don&#039;t know exactly how the first came to be, but some propose the first metabolisms had no genetics.

<br />
And the Mayan calendar is based on the stars, which the Mayans considered as their higher beings if I&#039;m not mistaken. Their theory is as credible as any other religion, then.<br />
