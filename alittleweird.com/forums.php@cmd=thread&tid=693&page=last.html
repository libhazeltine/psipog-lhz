thank you</div>Why not Visit the Psipog.net Articles? Are those not &quot;good&quot; enough? I&#039;d say that that would be your best method of learning Telepathy, although a little outdated, Psipog.net&#039;s Articles are very useful to anyone learning any of the major psychic skills. I doubt you will find anyone willing to teach you in person.<br />

Good luck. :)<br />
