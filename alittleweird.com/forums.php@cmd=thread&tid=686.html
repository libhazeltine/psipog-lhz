		<div id="post_13158" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So, I don&#039;t usually make threads here, but I had a few pretty odd dreams this past night. I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;re supposed to mean, if anything, but they were pretty weird, and I don&#039;t have dreams/nightmares like this often...<br />
<br />
So, here&#039;s how it went down in my dream...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m in the parking lot of this strip mall in my town, when I&#039;m ambushed by these people with guns. Some are wearing black gas masks, others ski masks. They come up over and over again in these dreams...they knock me down, somehow, and their &quot;leader&quot; comes up to me. I ask him what&#039;s going on, and he says that because I failed to turn something/someone over to him, he&#039;s taking me. I kind of black out here...<br />
<br />
The next part is pretty fuzzy. I wake up in a white room with some other person I don&#039;t know. There&#039;s a computer and chair in there, plus a button...basically, the setup is that there&#039;s a database on the computer of people, some famous, some I don&#039;t even know. You select a person, and they appear in the chair...and you have to keep hitting the person with a blunt object until you &quot;enjoy it&quot;. I&#039;m initially reluctant, and don&#039;t do it, but they say that if I don&#039;t do it, they&#039;ll kill me...so, I&#039;m not entirely sure what happens next, but I end up hitting someone a few times with a metal object of some kind, and I don&#039;t remember anything else.<br />
<br />
The next part of the dream is pretty weird. I&#039;m outside of the &quot;beating room&quot;, in my house. I know that I escaped from the people who caught me, and know that they&#039;re after me. For some reason, I go on the internet and start deleting all information about me and where I live, what I look like, etc. At this point, I have a weird sort of epiphany where I realize that the people after me are called &quot;The Conduit&quot; and are abducting other people besides me, as well. I also got the feeling that they had some sort of supernatural/futuristic/alien powers of some kind, though I can&#039;t explain how I knew any of this. The Conduit, apparently, was pretty well established all over the USA, and especially the internet, keeping tabs on a lot of different web sites and message boards, and doing recruiting there, as well. <br />
<br />
Anyway, flash-forward again...the next thing I remember is being in a car at night with someone else. This other person is driving. We are both on the run from The Conduit. We&#039;re driving on a fairly busy road in my town, that just happens to be right next to the strip mall where I was first ambushed. We notice that there is another car following us, and are worried it is The Conduit, so we attempt to lose them by making a really abrupt (and somewhat illegal) turn onto the Highway. The car follows us, and I can see two men wearing gas masks are in the car. <br />
<br />
So, me and the person in the car are flipping the fuck out. For some reason, the guy I&#039;m with pulls into the parking lot where I was first abducted, by the strip mall. The other car follows. I suggest we just kill the guys following us, but the person driving the car says that won&#039;t work, and I have another weird epiphany where I realize that The Conduit, or at least the more important members of it, are not entirely human...so, we pull over by the strip mall and get out of the car with our hands raised. <br />
<br />
Now, in the strip mall, there is a bank with clear glass windows. Inside, I see scientists and businessmen all at desks, some eating and talking. I know they won&#039;t help, though, as they are also with The Conduit. Anyway, two guys in suits step out, looking pretty frazzled and holding these pretty big, futuristic guns. The guy who was in the car with me says, &quot;That won&#039;t be necessary, we&#039;ll go willingly.&quot;, and the men in suits say, &quot;Sorry, the boss doesn&#039;t want to risk live specimens today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men shoot at us with the guns, and little darts fly out. I feel a tiny ping of pain as it pierces my skin and injects something into me, and then I fall unconscious and wake up...the end.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that&#039;s hard to understand...it was pretty much a stream-of-consciousness thing, and the dream is so strangely disjointed and blurry that it doesn&#039;t even make much sense to me...however, it was much more vivid at the time than most dreams I have, and the recurring theme of &quot;The Conduit&quot; is weird, considering I woke up and feel asleep at several points during the night, and they were there in every dream. Thoughts on this? Dreams are supposed to be metaphors for problems you&#039;re having in real life, but I don&#039;t know what the hell this is supposed to represent... o.O</div>

		<div id="post_13164" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I seriously don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with dreams. Most of the time they&#039;re randomly enjoyable but other times they kinda say something. Recently, i had a dream with a haphazard plot (that included zombies =D) and then i got to a computer in which i was logged onto Gmail. I saw a friend&#039;s status message as &quot;bewildered&quot; but didn&#039;t pay much attention to it. Later when i woke up, I logged onto gmail and saw that same friend but with a status of &quot;confused.&quot; Then i thought, &quot;Heyy, i knew that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Other times i&#039;ve had dreams like one that included a 2 way street with a glowing red-eyed tiki in the middle and an oncoming elephant with a tornado trailing behind and i just calmly walked to the shack that was behind me. I don&#039;t know, but i don&#039;t think that dream had any meaning..</div>

Okay Anonymous, a few things. YOu might watch too much films, you might play too many computergames or you just have a damn creative phantasy. Or the least possible thing, The Conduit actually exists and you came into contact with them while you were dreaming and you actually subconsciously created a second body for yourself with which you were walking around while you thought you were dreaming. And when they shot you this body destroyed itself and that way you woke up. (That would be some awesome &quot;Dreamwalking&quot;)<br />
<br />
.....that would also fit perfectly for the movie</div>

So, I don&#039;t usually make threads here, but I had a few pretty odd dreams this past night. I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;re supposed to mean, if anything, but they were pretty weird, and I don&#039;t have dreams/nightmares like this often...<br />
<br />
So, here&#039;s how it went down in my dream...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m in the parking lot of this strip mall in my town, when I&#039;m ambushed by these people with guns. Some are wearing black gas masks, others ski masks. They come up over and over again in these dreams...they knock me down, somehow, and their &quot;leader&quot; comes up to me. I ask him what&#039;s going on, and he says that because I failed to turn something/someone over to him, he&#039;s taking me. I kind of black out here...<br />
<br />
The next part is pretty fuzzy. I wake up in a white room with some other person I don&#039;t know. There&#039;s a computer and chair in there, plus a button...basically, the setup is that there&#039;s a database on the computer of people, some famous, some I don&#039;t even know. You select a person, and they appear in the chair...and you have to keep hitting the person with a blunt object until you &quot;enjoy it&quot;. I&#039;m initially reluctant, and don&#039;t do it, but they say that if I don&#039;t do it, they&#039;ll kill me...so, I&#039;m not entirely sure what happens next, but I end up hitting someone a few times with a metal object of some kind, and I don&#039;t remember anything else.<br />
<br />
The next part of the dream is pretty weird. I&#039;m outside of the &quot;beating room&quot;, in my house. I know that I escaped from the people who caught me, and know that they&#039;re after me. For some reason, I go on the internet and start deleting all information about me and where I live, what I look like, etc. At this point, I have a weird sort of epiphany where I realize that the people after me are called &quot;The Conduit&quot; and are abducting other people besides me, as well. I also got the feeling that they had some sort of supernatural/futuristic/alien powers of some kind, though I can&#039;t explain how I knew any of this. The Conduit, apparently, was pretty well established all over the USA, and especially the internet, keeping tabs on a lot of different web sites and message boards, and doing recruiting there, as well. <br />
<br />
Anyway, flash-forward again...the next thing I remember is being in a car at night with someone else. This other person is driving. We are both on the run from The Conduit. We&#039;re driving on a fairly busy road in my town, that just happens to be right next to the strip mall where I was first ambushed. We notice that there is another car following us, and are worried it is The Conduit, so we attempt to lose them by making a really abrupt (and somewhat illegal) turn onto the Highway. The car follows us, and I can see two men wearing gas masks are in the car. <br />
<br />
So, me and the person in the car are flipping the fuck out. For some reason, the guy I&#039;m with pulls into the parking lot where I was first abducted, by the strip mall. The other car follows. I suggest we just kill the guys following us, but the person driving the car says that won&#039;t work, and I have another weird epiphany where I realize that The Conduit, or at least the more important members of it, are not entirely human...so, we pull over by the strip mall and get out of the car with our hands raised. <br />
<br />
Now, in the strip mall, there is a bank with clear glass windows. Inside, I see scientists and businessmen all at desks, some eating and talking. I know they won&#039;t help, though, as they are also with The Conduit. Anyway, two guys in suits step out, looking pretty frazzled and holding these pretty big, futuristic guns. The guy who was in the car with me says, &quot;That won&#039;t be necessary, we&#039;ll go willingly.&quot;, and the men in suits say, &quot;Sorry, the boss doesn&#039;t want to risk live specimens today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men shoot at us with the guns, and little darts fly out. I feel a tiny ping of pain as it pierces my skin and injects something into me, and then I fall unconscious and wake up...the end.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that&#039;s hard to understand...it was pretty much a stream-of-consciousness thing, and the dream is so strangely disjointed and blurry that it doesn&#039;t even make much sense to me...however, it was much more vivid at the time than most dreams I have, and the recurring theme of &quot;The Conduit&quot; is weird, considering I woke up and feel asleep at several points during the night, and they were there in every dream. Thoughts on this? Dreams are supposed to be metaphors for problems you&#039;re having in real life, but I don&#039;t know what the hell this is supposed to represent... o.O</div></div>
