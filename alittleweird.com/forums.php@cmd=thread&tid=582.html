   It could be fog...but now I don&#039;t think that&#039;s very likely, cuz it&#039;s 22 degrees(c) in my room...but yeah, I could be hallucinating. I remember reading about &quot;psi-tendrils&quot; from some other thread, not sure if they are related, because the white stuff didn&#039;t seem like to be under my control, not so sure though. Oh, and I don&#039;t have aura sight, so it could be fog since I&#039;m not supposed to see psi...<br />

However when I tried to focus on my hand this morning, I saw an almost transparent stream around my hand, its very thin, but still, I don&#039;t have aura sight(and aura is supposed to be light blue right? or so others say), I also kept pick up these &quot;white foggy clouds&quot; , similarly to when you breath hot air into the cold(the floating part), and similar to a very thin cloud of white flour(the part it looks), I see them about a feet from my hand, and I felt like the &quot;white foggy clouds&quot; are coming from my hand. <br />
<br />
Though right now I&#039;m speculating on if this is sign or something, but it seems that the white things are continuously escaping from my body, I only see them when I focus, so normally I don&#039;t see them at all.

[quote]White: serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, rather than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic colors). It is impossible to &quot;tune&quot; the noise to an orchestra playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates a lack of harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is harmonious. This harmony comes in discrete vibration &quot;tones&quot; or harmonics, partially described by the modern quantum physics.
Several hours before the death, the Aura becomes white, and greatly increases in intensity. For this reason in most cultures &quot;death&quot; is depicted in WHITE (not black), because in the past, people could actually see a white Aura before death. It seems that our ancestors knew much more than we are prepared to admit.[/quote]
