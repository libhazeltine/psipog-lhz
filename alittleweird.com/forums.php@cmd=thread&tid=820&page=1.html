That&#039;s a really neat article, sh! I browsed through it just now and I sure will read it later tonight!

As for me I don&#039;t know much about wicca, magick or even werewolves, sorry =/ As for my interests, well, it&#039;s pretty much the usual thing you&#039;d find on boards like this one: psionics, etc. But this thread has sparked my curiosity! Also I&#039;ve heard a bit about people claiming to be vampires, but I haven&#039;t seen anybody who seemed serious enough about it for me to fully believe them...

<br />
I saw an interview on TV last year that featured a woman who has all the symptoms a vampire would have... They can&#039;t tolerate light because they don&#039;t have the heme normal people have in their blood. Because of their lack of heme, they end up becoming allergic to garlic and grow lots of hair. The skin around their mouths tighten, which makes their teeth look strange and they also get really badly burned in the sunlight... They get sores and such that don&#039;t heal well. It&#039;s called porphyria, you can look it up on wikipedia.<br />
<br />
(Sorry, I can&#039;t find the video :P It was in french anyway)<br />
<br />
PS Basically, it&#039;s a rare genetic blood disease.</div>

really has it been proven so?if it has then I&#039;m sure i could find it somewhere on the internet</div>Probably, you can find anything on the internet with enough patience, but as sh said: good luck... This kind of stuff is tough to find... <br />
<br />
Actually I&#039;ve got a story that&#039;s kind of on topic:<br />
<br />
If you read the text about werewolves on sh&#039;s blog (thanks again for providing the great text :D) there&#039;s a section that describes the different types of werewolves: Lycanthropes, Loups and another one I can&#039;t remember the name... Now that I think of it, I might actually personally know a lycanthrope ~_~&quot; She&#039;s a very... eccentric, dynamic and enthusiastic girl, but once a month, during the full moon (And sometimes a few hours, sometimes a day before and after), she gets weird... She&#039;s just not as sympathetic as usual, gets easily frustrated and can get aggressive. I don&#039;t know if lycanthropes are supposed to literally act like animals or just have a radical change in personality, but when she&#039;s in that &quot;werewolf state&quot; she&#039;s just not the same. I&#039;ve known her since 3rd grade (That&#039;s 9 years now) and I&#039;ve never seen someone act their complete opposite like that... The irony is, I&#039;ve never talked to her about psionics, the paranormal or anything, but over the years, it&#039;s become an inside joke in our group of friends to call her &quot;Werewolf&quot;... Now that I think of it... It might not just be a joke... She often tells me &quot;I&#039;m a werewolf&quot; when its the full moon, and once I asked her if she believed it, just out of curiosity and she said she did. She was serious about it, too...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I&#039;ll let you decide what you think about it ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: The third type was Hexenwulf ^_^</div>

<br />
A little update on my friend&#039;s story: I showed her tha article and everything and she was like &quot;Yeah, I know I&#039;m a lycanthrope =)&quot; She just thought talking about it seriously might get people to think she was crazy, so she decided to use it as a joke when around others. Seems she&#039;s been aware of being a werewolf for some time then o.o<br />
<br />
Talking about this makes me think about a dream I used to have... You know those dreams that, when you wake up, you feel like you would give anything to go back... (Usually for me they&#039;re love stories or the like) But when I was younger (around 8 I guess) I would have this dream, I called it the red dream, because I saw only in shades of red. Anyway, in that dream, I was walking on all fours and running around in the street, hunting down people... It most probably means nothing, &#039;cause I have an insane amount of imagination, but it was one of those dreams that feel so real and when I woke up... I wanted to go back, the same way you&#039;d want to go back to a happy dream. I was surprised to remember this dream after so many years, but now that I think of it, isn&#039;t it strange that I wanted to go back to this primal urge of hunting? O_O Maybe it was just my crazy lil mind after playing too many video games, though xD</div>
