First of all, They referred to any feeling or effect that caused any form of change as energy (and in essence, it is), they weren&#039;t as specific about energy as western science is.<br />
<br />
As for the last comment you made, I don&#039;t feel that anything goes against what nature wants because nature doesn&#039;t want anything. Nature is something free of ego or duality.<br />
<br />
I personally think that people normally don&#039;t make psiballs because the act of making one is just controlling muscles one wouldn&#039;t normally use.<br />
<br />
I recently learned in health class that we have muscles in the skin that either contract or relax, cant remember which, anyway, they cause the blood vessels to widen and radiate heat, I figure that if we can control these muscles, it&#039;s a possible explanation for psi-balls. If that&#039;s the case, it brings a Psion down to one key belief, Energy has more characteristics then just + and -.<br />
<br />
I think that if energy has more characteristics than just positive and negative, one could accurately prove the rest of psionics. In effect, the brain always reads energy and controls it, It&#039;s Scientific fact.<br />
<br />
I need to study that a little more, but I think it makes sense. As for controlling energy outside of the body, we&#039;re not completely insulated (70% of the body is made up of water, a conductor, not an insulator.) <br />

<br />
No, you didn&#039;t quite understand.  Going against what nature wants is a scientific expression, to determine that without some kind of extra energy or will, it doesn&#039;t happen.  It doesn&#039;t mean nature has an &quot;ego&quot; or &quot;duality&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you followed up with the facilitated transport idea that I put in there,<br />
inter-membrane proteins must use ATP (cellular energy currency) in order to trap a nutrients and bring it into the cell through the cell membrane, rather than diffusion, which requires no ATP (cellular energy currency) to bring nutrients into the cell through the cell membrane.  <br />
The latter is &quot;what nature wants&quot; because it happens without any extra applied energy or will, while by contrast facilitated transport does.<br />
<br />
So, my idea here isn&#039;t that &quot;making psiballs is unnatural and shouldn&#039;t happen&quot; it is &quot;making psiballs requires energy or will power&quot; so in otherwords, it doesn&#039;t happen without us making it happen.  <br />
<br />
So, the idea of having to choose to develop your psionic muscle, in most cases, perfectly fits with the idea that making psiballs isn&#039;t what nature wants because rather than it just happening with psiballs forming all around us all the time without our consent, we must choose to apply energy/thought/will to making a psiball and practicing our psionic muscle.  <br />
<br />
SO with that said, <br />
if energy flows naturally (as in normally) in circles through our body, then a magnetic resistence that you, and others on this forum, have experienced could be explained by the fact that when you make a psiball, you must apply energy/thought/will to making it, thus it goes against the natural (normal) flow of energy in your body and through your energy/thought/will it creates a magnetic resistence because it is unnatural (meaning you had to apply energy/thought/will in order to form a psiball, not that it shouldn&#039;t happen or that nature as a force of ego and duality doesn&#039;t want it to happen).<br />
<br />
In nature, when a magnetic resistence is formed, it is because something is pushing to opposing forces against each other or applying eneryg/force<br />
(eg: when we push the opposite sides of a magnet together, we feel the magnetic resistence because we are pushing it together, however without us pushing it, there would be no magnetic force for us to feel.  Thus, it only happend because we applied extra thought/energy/will/force in order to make it happen)<br />

So, the idea of having to choose to develop your psionic muscle, in most cases, perfectly fits with the idea that making psiballs isn&#039;t what nature wants because rather than it just happening with psiballs forming all around us all the time without our consent, we must choose to apply energy/thought/will to making a psiball and practicing our psionic muscle.  

SO with that said, 
if energy flows naturally (as in normally) in circles through our body, then a magnetic resistence that you, and others on this forum, have experienced could be explained by the fact that when you make a psiball, you must apply energy/thought/will to making it, thus it goes against the natural (normal) flow of energy in your body and through your energy/thought/will it creates a magnetic resistence because it is unnatural (meaning you had to apply energy/thought/will in order to form a psiball, not that it shouldn&#039;t happen or that nature as a force of ego and duality doesn&#039;t want it to happen).

In nature, when a magnetic resistence is formed, it is because something is pushing to opposing forces against each other or applying eneryg/force
(eg: when we push the opposite sides of a magnet together, we feel the magnetic resistence because we are pushing it together, however without us pushing it, there would be no magnetic force for us to feel.  Thus, it only happend because we applied extra thought/energy/will/force in order to make it happen)</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

In short, cavemen didn&#039;t sit around making psiballs to catch their next meal. But perhaps they had just enough psychic instinct to allow themselves to survive otherwise normally.</div>

The phrase &quot;what nature wants&quot; is an expression.<br />
If nature wants something, then it can happen without any extra willpower/energy/thought/force/etc, anything.<br />
It doesn&#039;t mean nature wants, in the sense that people want.<br />
<br />
What nature &quot;doesn&#039;t want&quot; is also an expression.<br />
If nature doesn&#039;t want something, then it happens with the addition or presence of willpower/energy/thought/force/etc.<br />
<br />
When you pick up a rock, you become a &quot;force against nature&quot;.<br />
(Another expression, please don&#039;t take it literally).<br />
When you think, &quot;Pick up that rock.&quot; You are applying chemical energy to your brain and muscles so that your brain can send signals down to your nervous system and your muscles can contract and retract. <br />
When you pick up that rock, you are going against gravity, pushing against the force, and you are using your energy/thought/willpower to do so.<br />
That is against nature because without the addition of such things, it would have never happend.<br />
<br />
The rock, just sitting there in peace, isn&#039;t against nature because that happens naturally, it doesn&#039;t require any energy/thought/willpower for the rock to just sit there.  It just is.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the trippy part, in order for something to be alive, does it require energy?<br />
Yes. Lots and lots of energy.<br />
In fact, 1 of the 5 requirements of life is &quot;Energy Use and Metabolism&quot;.<br />
That means, life is not natural.<br />
<br />
Do I mean that it shouldn&#039;t happen?<br />
No, it just means, it takes something extra for life to happen.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
You collect every molecule necessary to make a human being, put all those molecules in one place, does that big clump of molecules become a human being? No.<br />
<br />
This topic is getting a little bit too close to the theory of evolution and its numerous debates, so, I think I&#039;ll stop here.  <br />
I hope someone got it.</div>

<br />
As for the magnetic resistance, I do feel this but am not 100% sure whether it is related to psionics or our bodies. We constantly have electric pulses going through our bodies by way of nerves which could explain why one would feel this, if one is concentrating on both hands perhaps more of this charge is being sent to them, if only a small amount more. Since this charge is probably of the same sort then they would repel each other. <br />
<br />
Or I could be completely wrong, I do not have the experience in biology nor enough experience in psionics to truly get a firm idea.<br />
<br />
Just a possibility, also I apologize for my wording, I am horrible at putting my thoughts into words.<br />
<br />
Also, The energy circulation sounds interesting, I believe I shall search for information on that. Thank you for giving saomething interesting thing to learn about.</div>
