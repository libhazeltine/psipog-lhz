you know what screw you im not spaming any one u better shut your fucking mouth im not stupid dont go around telling ppl shit this is a conversation starter ok not a spamming thingy so go fuck yourself in the ass dip shit<br />
(i hate it when ppl do this shit)!!</div>Seems like I struck a nerve with this thirteen year-old girl. Seriously, the forums are not a chatroom, get used to it. Forums are intended for intelligent discussion of specific topics, chatrooms are for random conversations. Also, I never said you were stupid (paging Dr. Frued... paging Dr. Frued...). I said you had no keyboarding skills and you were annoying. I miss the lovely page (with the small text about posting intelligently) you had to go through to get to the old PsiPog forums. At least then I could say &quot;didn&#039;t you read the message you had to go past to get here?&quot; Granted, the &quot;user above you is in jail&quot; topic isn&#039;t very intelligent, but at least its poster put it in the correct place.<br />

Also, I love the part where she says &quot;you better shut your fucking mouth,&quot; as if I&#039;m afraid of what a young girl might do. You can&#039;t haxx0r me, you don&#039;t know where I live (and even if you did, so what?), and you&#039;re most likely not a developed psion.</div>Absolutely...<br />

You shouldn&#039;t apologize for the thread, it was a mistake in all honesty-  But if you wanted to talk about bullshit you should have paid attention to where the bullshit gathers, not where people are talking about specific things,  this is a paranormal group and mixing the bullshit with the specific (especially with the quality of your typing) Makes it seem like trolling..<br />

But I digress, this was a simple mistake and one you shouldn&#039;t have to apologize for.   However, being completely defensive and standoffish with everyone thats trying to guide you in the right way is something you SHOULD apologize for.  Because its &lt;IMMATURE&gt;<br />

You sit and claim maturity, but you&#039;re just as immature as every other chat-rat that wanders in here; knocking heads with the other underlings trying like hell to be equal when you&#039;ve done more to lose respect than to gain it.<br />
