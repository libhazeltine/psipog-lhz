Its not just this post, personally it seems like your quick to dismiss everything as ego. I&#039;m not sure where in the discussion specifically I find your style bothersome though; something just doesn&#039;t sit well. <br />
<br />
I was thinking the post was more a personal perspective thing though it has turned into a 20 questions game. So perhaps your correct to bring the god illusion into discussion, I had planned to just watch where the talking goes.<br />

@Sheep<br />
They are ideas, like those that make up philosophy. Religion used to be akin to applied philosophy, in time it has shifted closer in meaning to a nearly unquestionable creed. I treat religion as a philosophy, its a tad more theatrical but perhaps thats what it takes to get the majority to hear you. :P You can argue over scientific conclusions, philosophical ideas, political opinions.. at which point does religion become something you cannot debate (with the right people)?</div>

<br />
Needless to say, I had a lot of information wasted... But to get he Gist of it, I was wondering what exactly do you think it is that causes my style to &quot;not sit well&quot; with you... and also, which style specifically are you talking about? My style of Writing? My Thought Process? My Philosophy itself?<br />
<br />
I have a feeling about what it is, but I&#039;m really not sure if it&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking of. Although I&#039;m guessing along the lines of me putting forth an Idea and then Expanding the information to a pinpoint conclusion that would seem as though everything, including the original Idea was a Absolute, irrefutable fact... Which many people find unsettling and it usually results in a feeling that I myself have been hit Hard by the Cruelty of reality and have now come to have a Twisted sense of what reality truly is.<br />
<br />
The Simple fact of the matter is that I keep everything I say in the form of Hypotheticals. I Say no Lies to you and yet no Truths. Only expressing my train of thought as it curves and winds along the track. What I say shakes people&#039;s beliefs, and that&#039;s why people usually find that I am, for lack of a better word, Disturbing.<br />

So... Did I hit the nail on the head?</div>

I know I made it long and confusing about original sin, but the basic point of what I was saying is that the Bible says we arent to be punished for what our parents do, yet here we are, not perfect and able to be with God on earth because they ate the forbidden fruit.

New info would be a lot of stuff.<br />
i.e. new info for christianity: the bible was believed to be historically inaccurate because the hittites mentioned therein did not exist. New evidence was found during an archaeological dig that turned up entire cities that belonged to the hittites.<br />
<br />
i.e. against christianity: Many people took for granted the fact that noah fit everything on his ark. Some guy with a lot of resources does some heavy math, and makes some new info stating that every species would have about a square foot of room on the ark, not including birds or insects which possibly could have rested on perches along the walls, which leaves half a square foot for each animal, including the dinosaurs, which are mentioned in the bible as still existing after the great flood.<br />
<br />
i.e. nothing to do with religion at all: Gravity works every time. Then new info comes up saying 99.9 of the time, it works every time. Some subatomic particles, even though they have mass, are not attracted to other particles or even the earth by gravity. <br />
<br />
So even something as &quot;simple&quot; as gravity is a total mystery to us, just a theory! new info comes up all the time as we find out more and more.<br />

		<div id="post_10616" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">well, life is interesting. I&#039;m not sure as to why we are here, but I would say if there is no god, were just here to have a good time. If there is a god, there&#039;s no way of knowing who he/she is cause they won&#039;t come down to talk to us, so the purpose of life would be to have fun, but also make life enjoyable for others. Humanitarianism should be something everyone strives for, trying to make the world a better place for everyone. At least it gives you some purpose to fulfill till the end comes around, eh?<br />
<br />
Religion is interesting as well, I would have to guess made to control the masses, whether for better or worse. Some people, without purpose, tend to think they can just get away with doing anything and try to make their purpose to take as much as they can from everyone else. So I appreciate what religion has done for the world. Also though, there are no doubt some corrupt people at the top at different points in time, milking the whole operation (which is not appreciated, of course).<br />
<br />
But yeah, religion is to give people a purpose, and thus control the masses by making them think that being good will reward them more than doing evil, because on this earth, someone who is good at what they do can gather more reward doing evil than good. So if they are threatened with afterlife, sometimes they are put in their place and become better people.<br />

What are your thoughts on such subjects?</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10616">well, life is interesting. I&#039;m not sure as to why we are here, but I would say if there is no god, were just here to have a good time. If there is a god, there&#039;s no way of knowing who he/she is cause they won&#039;t come down to talk to us, so the purpose of life would be to have fun, but also make life enjoyable for others. Humanitarianism should be something everyone strives for, trying to make the world a better place for everyone. At least it gives you some purpose to fulfill till the end comes around, eh?

Religion is interesting as well, I would have to guess made to control the masses, whether for better or worse. Some people, without purpose, tend to think they can just get away with doing anything and try to make their purpose to take as much as they can from everyone else. So I appreciate what religion has done for the world. Also though, there are no doubt some corrupt people at the top at different points in time, milking the whole operation (which is not appreciated, of course).

But yeah, religion is to give people a purpose, and thus control the masses by making them think that being good will reward them more than doing evil, because on this earth, someone who is good at what they do can gather more reward doing evil than good. So if they are threatened with afterlife, sometimes they are put in their place and become better people.

Good question =P Though if nobody had any self-esteem, wouldn&#039;t everyone be commiting suicide? Prehaps instead of using the word &quot;ego&quot; you could use the definition you mean of it instead...that would help clarify the point, not to mention keep it from getting too repetative. <br />

and if everything has a goal, how do you reach it through observation? If your purpose is to observe, what is the purpose of observing? heh, another paradox, the purpose paradox.

When I saw you quoting scripture my first instinct was &#039;oh man, here we go&#039; but that it was rather contrary to the majority direction i found refreshing. The people who don&#039;t realize lucifer to satan/fallen angel thing is a christian creation and try to prove the idea with the bible always bother me.<br />
<br />
Someone to look at for the development of religions is Joseph Campbell.. I think you can find his mythos( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythos_%28film%29" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythos_%28film%29</a>)videos in parts on myspace (like 16 hours total or something i think). They are lecture(with images and a couple tangent myth stories) but if your interested a lecture is never boring.<br />
<br />
@Akio<br />
I find it more annoying than disturbing (pretty strong word). You definitely don&#039;t come off like your speaking hypothetically and I think you over simplify in some cases. In others it might just be a conflict on word choice where we might agree but I don&#039;t care for your wording or its unclear to me. Its a number of things but I&#039;m not sure if one of them is at the heart or they all melt together for an overall sense.<br />
<br />
For example you saying &quot;nothing has a purpose, only a goal.&quot; to me the words goal and purpose are nearly synonymous. I can understand there being a difference but in the version I imagine it I come to the opposite conclusion. If goal is the end, and purpose is found in the journey then I would argue the point of dancing is to dance, not to end up wherever you are when you finish the last step. In the case of the purpose of life is to observe, I&#039;d prefer the word experience; though I could see them used interchangeably assuming we have the same conclusion.</div>

Basically there can be no true purpose to anything because purpose in itself is a paradox, yes.<br />
<br />
And As for the Philosophical Religions... I think I can help you on that. Take Everything you learned about your religion, and take out every rule and regulation, but keep the basic Idea. For a Christian, that Idea is something around the lines of &quot;Do what Jesus would do&quot; or &quot;Try to be pure, untainted, and true in everything you do and say.&quot; Every thing after the basic Christian religion that is a derivative of Christianity can be considered a Political Religion, because it adds rules and regulations, rather than guides. <br />

I mean what it&#039;s definition is, in it&#039;s entirety. I don&#039;t see the point if using the definition of the word when there&#039;s a word to describe what I&#039;m talking about more quickly and simply. Although I will admit it does get a little repetitive. <br />
<br />
My Religion (not really a complete religion, but...) See&#039;s Ego in itself as a separate being, at least in a philosophic sense. Please understand that much at least ^_-.<br />

Nothing does have a purpose, we only make goals for ourselves. Some say that the purpose is found in the journey, and I would have to agree, to some extent, however; It does not in any way cange what I&#039;m saying.<br />

[q]If goal is the end, and purpose is found in the journey then I would argue the point of dancing is to dance, not to end up wherever you are when you finish the last step.[/q]<br />

If you were to put that argument out, I would say that the point of dancing was for the goal of whatever you are to attain in the end. Dancing has many goals... Political advancement, enjoyment, procreation, mockery, etc. but in the long term, doing these things through dance has no more value that to do it any other way, and therefore Dancing in itself has no purpose. <br />

		<div id="post_10652" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">that and I just realized his 1.54 million cubic feet which sounded so large is volume. wasnt thinking the first time i read it. but these animals are going to have to be standing (most anyway) and have some breathing room, or you&#039;re gonna have rampant disease and rot and bone displacements. so they would have 111, 375 square feet (for 3 floors, assuming none stood on top to rot in the rain for 40 days) which, even for 20,000 species living today, leaves little room. Plus, they would have to have food for 5 months (150 days) when you think of 20,000 animals, thats a bit of food thats gonna be taking up space.<br />
Then theres also the fact that each floor would be a mere 14 feet or less high. some animals need more room than that. A giraffe is usually 12 foot tall before it can leave its mother, and would continue growing those 150 days, therefore rendering the baby animals theory useless (not to mention dinosaurs that could easily have grown at a much faster tick). Theres a lot of stuff that made me think on though. And now I have some more research to undertake, lol</div>
