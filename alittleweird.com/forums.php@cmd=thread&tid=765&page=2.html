It isn&#039;t too difficult to draw in energy from the universe, is it? So unless you are doing something physical instead of something energetic when you try to heal someone, it shouldn&#039;t exhaust you. Except perhaps for the physical side effects that might occur, however, since we are not dealing with life-threatening energy blockades here (as far as I am aware) it shouldn&#039;t be too much of a problem. Personally, I am interested in your skills as a healer, and I wonder if you can heal those people from a distance.<br />

Just like any other physical skill: if you do it for a while, you start to get tired. To get back to normal, take a break, take a nap, eat some food, drink some water, etc...<br />
<br />
PK is just like anything else. It takes effort to do, and sometimes you need to take a break and rest.<br />

<br />
~Falcon</div>Here&#039;s my take on it:<br />
<br />
I woke up pretty early, which is unusual in itself, and I wasn&#039;t tired, and I felt pretty good (The time sh posted I was still asleep). I went about my morning schedule and checked messages, etc, and saw the post, so I tried to move energy around my neck and was pretty pleased to find out that I could. Ever since I read that book X-Master posted I&#039;ve been trying to fix my spine some, since it&#039;s a little curvy (oddly enough in my neck and my hip areas mostly), but didn&#039;t have any success. So last night I tried to fix it again, and managed to get it really hot and then it felt better, and I had the best sleep I&#039;ve had in ages. When I got up I felt much better, and my weight was evenly distributed, and I didn&#039;t naturally sit funny at the table, etc. It felt like I had been to the chiropractor, but with a lot less soreness.<br />
<br />
Anyways, considering that I&#039;ve been trying to get rid of the blocks for a while, even going as far as to pretend they were gone, and then finally having major success at healing myself, I&#039;d say sh can heal from a distance.<br />
<br />

If you don&#039;t mind me asking, how bad was it when you healed me?</div>

A lack of sleep is what occurs most often in my case. I think that there are ways to prevent this illness and sick feeling, that might be meditating before or after creating a psi wheel. Or maybe stop when you are getting stressed while practicing.<br />

Thanks for the time you put into the healing, its much appreciated.  Unfortunately there doesn&#039;t seem to be any improvement, it may be that i&#039;m too far away, or that the damage done is beyond healing, i don&#039;t know.  But thats for the attempt.</div>

<br />
eat the right stuff, focus on your pain in a loving and compassionate way. with the right mind(fullness about it) The body is capable of mass healing..<br />
<br />
think about it.. <br />
you shed millons of cells.. <br />
new skin 10 times per year!<br />
bones are renewed several times in your life, as well..<br />
<br />
use the force, dude..<br />
<br />
there are several components that you can choose to ingest which will aid ye on yer ways!<br />
<br />
1. Vitamin C (THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ASCORBIC ACID: Ascorbic acid is a synthetic compound nowhere near as complex as natural Vitamin C) This wonder vitamin is responsible for maintaining cell membranes! Remember Scurvy? Cells were hemmoraging as a result of lack of natural home grown connection.. (Nowadays, this has compounded into a diptheria mode of operation, where the victem endures a slow transformation.. things like easy bruising, bleeding gums (Gingavitis is a well packaged myth), and irregular emotions (the thyroid gland requires Vit C to do its job.. ps, the thyroid is the chemical gas pedal for emotions.. heartbeat.. etc, etc.)<br />
<br />
2. MSM.. do your own research on this.. know that I have tested it after my car fight with a mountain.. a miraculous story of survival.<br />
<br />
3. Collidial silver (I think thats how its spelled :P)<br />
<br />
4. calcium/magnisium<br />
<br />
5. your bed (inactivity: preferably you meditate on treating your pain with love)<br />
<br />
thats all I can give you..<br />
<br />
I hope you find some use, and tell your hearties about it..<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div>
