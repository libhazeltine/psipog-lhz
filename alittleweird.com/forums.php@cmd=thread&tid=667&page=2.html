Wait. <br />
So your dad threatened to kill you if you call the police. So you didn&#039;t.<br />
So you&#039;re saying that your dad never leaves home, you&#039;re homeschooled, have no friends etc.<br />
Because otherwise how could he kill you if you&#039;re not there. At school you could have gone to any teacher and told them about it.<br />
At a friend&#039;s house you could have done the same.<br />
If he had left, you could have done it.<br />
Hell, if you called the police, told them what he did AND that he says he&#039;s going to kill you for making the call....<br />
<br />
I doubt he&#039;dve killed you. It wouldn&#039;t end well for him either way. <br />
<br />
So I&#039;m finding a bunch of holes in what you&#039;re saying-and I&#039;m forced to take the standpoint of a skeptic. <br />
<br />
Plus the fact that you&#039;ve pretty much already had the answers for yourself that everyone tried to give to you.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to three plausible conclusions.<br />
<br />
1) You&#039;re attention-seeking<br />
2) You are EXTREMELY gullible-which happens to be reinforced in your first post and the last post, as you seem to be taking one person&#039;s POV as THE POV. Did you even TRY to research beyond one person?<br />
3) I&#039;m too polite to say it</div>Yeah I can see where you&#039;re going there. I swear that everything I&#039;ve said is the truth, and at the time I tried to call the police because my dad just beat the hell out of me, and I wasn&#039;t thinking logically (though maybe you think it would have been logical, I’ll explain why it isn’t in a second), because I was fucking SCARED. I was actually planning to go to my friends house when I tried to run away from home. (If you read my first post, I did actually forget to add that I took my backpack with a phone book in it with me. Thought honestly I didn&#039;t think it was necessary to add at the time.) I didn’t think I needed to say that. Until apparently now. AT NO POINT DID I SAY THAT MY FATHERS THREAT KEPT ME FROM CALLING THE POLICE. I&#039;m not seeking attention. What would I gain from getting attention from a bunch of random people on a forum I don&#039;t even know? Look, I really don&#039;t want to get sent to a foster home. Where I will have basicly no entertainment, IE internet, television, ect. Yeah I know that sounds materialistic, but I honestly think It&#039;d be HORRIBLE. Or even worse. I&#039;ll have to move away for protection and lose all my friends. This means a little more to me than having to deal with my fathers shit, and I&#039;ll admit that I didn&#039;t believe he was actually going to kill me.<br />
<br />
No, I don&#039;t base all my research on Robert Peterson, most certainly not. It&#039;s just that I agree with him most of the time, so I like to use a lot of his ideals and quotes. I&#039;m not treating his books like some divine truth. As for <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus the fact that you&#039;ve pretty much already had the answers for yourself that everyone tried to give to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
... What? So I have explanations on how to deal with negative spirits, and a theory on demons. I don&#039;t understand how that helps me with my OBEing problem, or how that helps me with my irrational fears of hell and the unknown. Sure I have logical explanations for demons and hell and how to deal with negative spirits during OBE (And my opinion on fear, and why it&#039;s bad, ect.), but that dosen&#039;t mean my upbringing didn&#039;t give me IRRATIONAL FEARS of it. I’m talking about dealing with my emotions, not how I deal with entities that are manifested in the astral plane/out of my body. I don&#039;t really have the answers for getting over that, aside from &quot;face your fears&quot;. So if anyone else had my expiriences, I wanted to know how they got over it, and I also wasn&#039;t really expecting anyone to be this all knowing philosopher about it. I was just wanting to see if anyone had any good advise, bring up things I didn&#039;t already know. I wasn’t really asking “Hey everyone, what’s your ideas on fear and the existence of demons.” However, I did enjoy hearing every ones ideas and theories. Also, some of peoples thoughts contradicted mine, so I felt I had to justify it with a response to how I feel about the subject, and what I believe. Also, another thing about that is, people seemed to get a bit off topic about what I actually wanted HELP on.  I’m sorry if I came off as rude, you just made me feel really insulted.</div>

Which is apparently what you wanted. Why did we need to know all these details? You basically had two questions. If you wanted to explain WHY you had these fears you could have said you grew up with religious zealot parents and lost your faith in your religion as life progressed. <br />
<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your race.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your place of birth.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know you had sisters.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your father beat the shit out of you. (IF I assume you&#039;re telling the truth.)<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your father was a pastor.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your father&#039;s race.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know your age at the time of the beating.<br />
Didn&#039;t need to know a bunch of details between your Christian and Wiccan friend. <br />
<br />
All of this:<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">He basicly started hitting me across the face in a defensive manner and shoving me against the wall. Yeah, a well built African American grown man, WHO WAS A PASTOR, beating up skinny (I believe I was 12 years old) kid. I begged him, pleading him, to stop, telling him I&#039;m sorry and crying. Not only that, but once my mother finnally pulled him back and I ran to my room, my father threatened to KILL ME, if I called the police. That day I tried to run away from home, however I my mother saw me jump out my window and she immediately told my dad and sisters. My sisters chased after me and my dad yelled at me to come back as I was half way down the street with no shoes on, and a domestic violence phone number in my hand. If it wasn&#039;t for my sisters, I may have just ran, but my father problably would have caught and stopped me anyways. When I came back me and my father talked in the living room, he justified his beating me up with &quot;Maybe that&#039;s what you needed&quot;. I felt like getting on and punching him across the face at that point. Anything afterwards in that day, is now a blur to me.</div>Was irrelevant.<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">Yeah, a well built African American grown man, WHO WAS A PASTOR, beating up skinny (I believe I was 12 years old) kid.</div>You tell me you aren&#039;t seeking attention? Why is his race relevant? Are we all supposed to go *GASP* The violence of the black man? I mean...Wtf is that?<br />
<br />
And we don&#039;t need to know he&#039;s well-built. Who cares. If he was a 50lb anemic handicap in a wheel chair and was kicking your ass... You just want people to be all awww poor baby beat up by a big scary black man and WAIT FOR IT! He was a PASTOR! *Shocked silence*<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">My father was a tyrant to me and my older sisters, treating us very unfairly. I won&#039;t go into that right now, but my father has always had serious anger management problems.</div>When I first read this I was like oh good this isn&#039;t someone wanting others to cry over them. And then you went on to explain it. And you didn&#039;t have to. This basically said it all. <br />
<br />
Not that it&#039;s even relevant to your questions, but I could have dealt with it. This doesn&#039;t say PITY ME!<br />
<br />
I find it really annoying how you decided magically that ALL Christians are against things like psionics. Whether or not somebody believes in psionics, the supernatural, the paranormal...That CAN be influenced by religion, but more often than not, it is a personal decision by the individual. <br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">Not only that, but I still have a fear of hell and demons and fear of the unknown, it&#039;s ALOT less than before, but still large an irrational. Not to mention ironicly, somewhat a fear of the supernatural. Especially ghosts (I could never sit through horror movies.)</div>What you said HERE contradicts what you said in your last post.<br />
<br />
And you ask what is meant by <br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">&quot;Plus the fact that you&#039;ve pretty much already had the answers for yourself that everyone tried to give to you.&quot;</div>You blew off everything everbody said and posted these things that, from a personal standpoint, are pretty off-based. You refused the opinions of others.<br />
<br />
Wasn&#039;t that the point of the post? To get opinions from others? The only acknowledgement you gave was &quot;Thank you&quot;. So I think personally the questions were only a front for you to give us the tedious details of your life and hope for pity.<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">I do believe there are negative spirits out there, and I do believe they can do things to you. However, I believe they can if you ALLOW them to.</div>There is no allow and not allow. You apparently haven&#039;t had your own experience with this, otherwise you couldn&#039;t believe a word Petterson has said on the topic of demons.<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">&quot;The second kind of demon is a spirit that is playing the roll of a demon.

<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">Since I was born I grew up in a strict Christian home, where I was forced &quot;Do this, do that, you&#039;ll go to hell.&quot;. I often times wonder what my life would be like if I were Shinto. However, I was a protestant, better than being catholic I guess. My parents were zealots, and naturally, I began growing up as a zealot as well.<br />
<br />
My only hint of doubts began, when my life started to turn to shit. and my thoughts about Christianity began to contradict my fathers. I believe this happened around the time when my father became a pastor, and started his own church. My father was a tyrant to me and my older sisters, treating us very unfairly. I won&#039;t go into that right now, but my father has always had serious anger management problems.The only people I&#039;ve talked to about these doubts were online, as I could barely trust any of my real life friends to understand.<br />
<br />
One, happen to be a wiccan, and a good friend. He didn&#039;t really push his beliefs on me, and I still go to him today for wisdom. The other, happened to be a Christian. I was encouraged by this person, but not pushed, to keep trying Christianity. I don&#039;t know which of the two next events came first, but one, I would talk to my wiccan friend. We would talk about the astral plane, a subject that was totally new to me. I couldn&#039;t see him as a liar, so I did what was forced into my mindset. Assume that his astral projection was an influenced vision by satan.<br />
<br />
<br />
However I asked him how he entered the astral plane, and he told me &quot;You let your body sleep, but keep your mind awake.&quot; The next night, out of curiosity, I relaxed all my muscles till I couldn&#039;t feel them, and tried to stay awake, with my eyes closed and trying to see beyond my sight. Suddenly these vibration overcame me, and I felt this amazing sensation like I was floating and falling at the same time and I began seeing a bright light. It scared the HELL, at of me so I &quot;fell back into my body&quot;. This creaked open the closed door of my mind, however, I still used the devil as a scapegoat. I told my wiccan friend about it, he wasn&#039;t suprised at all. I told my Christian friend, and she was very... Skeptic<br />
<br />
My faith in Christianity quickly began to dwindle, yet somehow I still believed in it. About a year later, I decided &quot;I&#039;m not going to believe in a religion unless I believe in it, and not because it was forced on me.&quot; That&#039;s when I stopped being a zealot. My wiccan friend hadn&#039;t spoke with me in quite a while, and he told me I grew and matured a lot, not just in my beliefs. As I often asked god to show me proof of his existence, and nothing ever happened. Half my mind believes in Christianity out of fear of hell, the other had serious doubts, and often times was even against it. A long while later, last year. I haven&#039;t had a successful astral projection to my name, yet I still believed in it, though I feared trying. I met a friend online who I found out knew a lot about OBEs and the astral plane and the sort. He grew up in a strict Christian home too, and 15 was the age he stopped believing in it. Amazing, because that&#039;s exactly how old I was, (And still am).<br />
<br />
It was infact only a few months ago I believe, that he put my world into an amazing perspective. One where right and wrong are so clear. One where I don&#039;t have to be afraid of hell. However, since it was forced into me, it was like a sixth sense to fear it. He recommended me to books with excirsizes for OBEing like Robert Peterson&#039;s. HOWEVER, for the past few months, I&#039;ve been trying to astral project, but it&#039;s become very difficult for me. I rarley start to get that spark of vibrations, and even when I get the SMALLEST spark, my breathing starts to become heavy, and it disappears. Not only that, but I still have a fear of hell and demons and fear of the unknown, it&#039;s ALOT less than before, but still large an irrational. Not to mention ironicly, somewhat a fear of the supernatural. Especially ghosts (I could never sit through horror movies.) So that&#039;s my story.

A warm fuzzy feeling when people fawn and fret over you. Which is apparently what you wanted. Why did we need to know all these details? You basically had two questions. If you wanted to explain WHY you had these fears you could have said you grew up with religious zealot parents and lost your faith in your religion as life progressed. 

Didn&#039;t need to know your race.
Didn&#039;t need to know your place of birth.
Didn&#039;t need to know you had sisters.
Didn&#039;t need to know your father beat the shit out of you. (IF I assume you&#039;re telling the truth.)
Didn&#039;t need to know your father was a pastor.
Didn&#039;t need to know your father&#039;s race.
Didn&#039;t need to know your age at the time of the beating.
Didn&#039;t need to know a bunch of details between your Christian and Wiccan friend. 

All of this:

[QUOTE]He basicly started hitting me across the face in a defensive manner and shoving me against the wall. Yeah, a well built African American grown man, WHO WAS A PASTOR, beating up skinny (I believe I was 12 years old) kid. I begged him, pleading him, to stop, telling him I&#039;m sorry and crying. Not only that, but once my mother finnally pulled him back and I ran to my room, my father threatened to KILL ME, if I called the police. That day I tried to run away from home, however I my mother saw me jump out my window and she immediately told my dad and sisters. My sisters chased after me and my dad yelled at me to come back as I was half way down the street with no shoes on, and a domestic violence phone number in my hand. If it wasn&#039;t for my sisters, I may have just ran, but my father problably would have caught and stopped me anyways. When I came back me and my father talked in the living room, he justified his beating me up with &quot;Maybe that&#039;s what you needed&quot;. I felt like getting on and punching him across the face at that point. Anything afterwards in that day, is now a blur to me.[/QUOTE]

Was irrelevant.
[QUOTE]Yeah, a well built African American grown man, WHO WAS A PASTOR, beating up skinny (I believe I was 12 years old) kid.[/QUOTE]

You tell me you aren&#039;t seeking attention? Why is his race relevant? Are we all supposed to go *GASP* The violence of the black man? I mean...Wtf is that?

And we don&#039;t need to know he&#039;s well-built. Who cares. If he was a 50lb anemic handicap in a wheel chair and was kicking your ass... You just want people to be all awww poor baby beat up by a big scary black man and WAIT FOR IT! He was a PASTOR! *Shocked silence*

[QUOTE]My father was a tyrant to me and my older sisters, treating us very unfairly. I won&#039;t go into that right now, but my father has always had serious anger management problems.[/QUOTE]

When I first read this I was like oh good this isn&#039;t someone wanting others to cry over them. And then you went on to explain it. And you didn&#039;t have to. This basically said it all. 

Not that it&#039;s even relevant to your questions, but I could have dealt with it. This doesn&#039;t say PITY ME!

I find it really annoying how you decided magically that ALL Christians are against things like psionics. Whether or not somebody believes in psionics, the supernatural, the paranormal...That CAN be influenced by religion, but more often than not, it is a personal decision by the individual. 

[QUOTE]Not only that, but I still have a fear of hell and demons and fear of the unknown, it&#039;s ALOT less than before, but still large an irrational. Not to mention ironicly, somewhat a fear of the supernatural. Especially ghosts (I could never sit through horror movies.)[/QUOTE]

What you said HERE contradicts what you said in your last post.

And you ask what is meant by 

[QUOTE]&quot;Plus the fact that you&#039;ve pretty much already had the answers for yourself that everyone tried to give to you.&quot;[/QUOTE]

You blew off everything everbody said and posted these things that, from a personal standpoint, are pretty off-based. You refused the opinions of others.

Wasn&#039;t that the point of the post? To get opinions from others? The only acknowledgement you gave was &quot;Thank you&quot;. So I think personally the questions were only a front for you to give us the tedious details of your life and hope for pity.

[QUOTE]I do believe there are negative spirits out there, and I do believe they can do things to you. However, I believe they can if you ALLOW them to.[/QUOTE]

There is no allow and not allow. You apparently haven&#039;t had your own experience with this, otherwise you couldn&#039;t believe a word Petterson has said on the topic of demons.

[QUOTE]&quot;The second kind of demon is a spirit that is playing the roll of a demon. This kind of &quot;demon&quot; is really just an astral entity who is no different from you or me, but they&#039;re impersonating a demon.

<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">Then they ask, “Do you do astral projection or out-of-body travel?”<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I ask, “What do you mean? What=s the difference?”<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
They reply, “It depends on your location. Do you hover around the physical plane, or do you go to the Astral Plane? Or maybe the Mental Plane, the Etheric Plane, the Buddhic Plane, or maybe the Causal Plane?”<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I’ve never supported the distinction between OBE and astral projection because I think it=s trivial. In the past, I always answered the question this way: “During my OBEs, I just find myself in a place I don=t recognize and I=m not sure how to classify it. For example, I find myself in a strange house, but how am I supposed to know if it=s an Astral house or an Etheric house? How am I supposed to know that it=s an astral house in some Astral subdivision of some Astral suburb, or just a non-physical ‘echo’ of a physical house somewhere in this reality?”<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In other words, “I don=t know if the place I=m visiting is the Astral Plane or anywhere else, for that matter, because there isn’t exactly a fancy door with big neon sign that reads ‘Astral Plane.’”</div><div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">CLEARLY you lack any knowledge of the legal system at all.

I did read and go over everything else you said that I didn&#039;t touch on. However, they were mostly just making the same point. Unnecessary information that implies I was looking for pity, me contradicting myself and believing my opinion is totally correct and that I&#039;m being closed minded refusing to consider other peoples beliefs. As for that, meh. I guess in a sense I may have been looking for pity. HOWEVER, what I BELIEVE, is that I was just pointing out unnecessary only to make my situation seem worse was because I&#039;m filled with angst for my father. So I just poured my emotions all over the situation like it was a diary, I know my age dosen&#039;t excuse shit, but I mean, I am a kid. I can&#039;t really help doing that. I wasn&#039;t necessarily looking for pity, I was just more in this mindset that &quot;OMG MY FATHER IS SO HORRIBLE&quot;, so I typed what I felt and thought. As for believing my opinion is totally correct, I&#039;m sorry if I came off as a close minded zealot. But as somefatguy said<br />

[quote]&quot;The second kind of demon is a spirit that is playing the roll of a demon. This kind of &quot;demon&quot; is really just an astral entity who is no different from you or me, but they&#039;re impersonating a demon. Maybe they&#039;re trying to intimidate you or frighten you, but they are impostors nonetheless..
If you had done ANY kind of research on the astral plane, you&#039;d realize that WHILE in the astral plane, you cannot interact with things on THIS plane. There is a crossing over involved. No person can pretend to be a demon. It just doesn&#039;t work. If you ever become successful at astral projection, go ahead and try to interact with your environment. You won&#039;t be able to.

I could go into more meticulous detail, if you&#039;re interested.
[/QUOTE]
... Okay. I don&#039;t know when I said/implied that in the astral plane you can interact with things on this plane. That was just a quote from Robert Peterson, not something I wrote. Robert Peterson also wrote this:

[quote]Then they ask, “Do you do astral projection or out-of-body travel?”

 

I ask, “What do you mean? What=s the difference?”

 

They reply, “It depends on your location. Do you hover around the physical plane, or do you go to the Astral Plane? Or maybe the Mental Plane, the Etheric Plane, the Buddhic Plane, or maybe the Causal Plane?”

 

I’ve never supported the distinction between OBE and astral projection because I think it=s trivial. In the past, I always answered the question this way: “During my OBEs, I just find myself in a place I don=t recognize and I=m not sure how to classify it. For example, I find myself in a strange house, but how am I supposed to know if it=s an Astral house or an Etheric house? How am I supposed to know that it=s an astral house in some Astral subdivision of some Astral suburb, or just a non-physical ‘echo’ of a physical house somewhere in this reality?”

 

In other words, “I don=t know if the place I=m visiting is the Astral Plane or anywhere else, for that matter, because there isn’t exactly a fancy door with big neon sign that reads ‘Astral Plane.’”[/QUOTE]

[quote]CLEARLY you lack any knowledge of the legal system at all. First off, GENERALLY-not all the time but generally-DCFS and social services gets called in. You have a case made. Your family is put under supervision-your claims are either validated or discarded. If it is found that your father abused you again, you would most likely be put into governmental custody and become a ward of the state. MAYBE. Along with your siblings. Not that you&#039;d be together. Unless of course your mother moved away with you. Unlikely that they&#039;d let that happen. If you have any family, you will be put with them. They are next in line for legal custody, not some stranger. In the event you DIDN&#039;T have family, you would probably be put into a foster home-WHICH IS NOT AN ORPHANGE. Just regular people who take care of you. Not to say you&#039;d have a pleasant time, but they aren&#039;t all bad. And since they are people living in their own homes etc they&#039;d probably have commodities like television and the internet.[/QUOTE]

Yes, even though I may have been somewhat ignorant about the legal system. I&#039;d still rather not take the risk. Also my other family is either far south in the US, or in Japan. So I WOULD have to move away from my friends, ect. Don&#039;t have much else to say.

[quote]Boldness where that stuff is concerned is nothing short of pig-headedness. You lack fear, you will underestimate. Once again, I could go into more meticulous detail to explain this. If I don&#039;t, it&#039;ll sound like babbling. But I&#039;m not going to go into detail if you don&#039;t want it or refuse to listen. You can have your own opinions but you can&#039;t decide that your opinion is THE opinion.

There is a psychopath in front of you. He&#039;s got a gun and he has it pointed at your chest. Be bold, see what happens. Fear can be a VERY good thing to have.[/QUOTE]

Here, I would rather take the risk. I know a gun clearly has the power to kill me with ease. However, I know the fine line between courage, and paranoia. It&#039;s not really possible for me to be thinking logically about something no one can really prove. It&#039;s either I just take my chances or I try to take caution. But take caution doing what? If I&#039;m talking about demons, there isn&#039;t really much other choice than to give in, or face it head on. 

 
[quote]Why? It leaves out details that scream &quot;PITY ME!&quot; and clearly outline how you&#039;ve developed your problems[/QUOTE]
Well... All I can say about this is. True.

After my dad charged at me, and started hitting/shoving me, ect. My mom eventually pulled him back, I ran to my room, and my mom ran in to check on me to make sure i was alright. My room was like, 10 feet from the bathroom, as I live in a very small house. I started talking to my mother, and I DID tell her I was going to run away, and I told her not to stop me. OH SHIT IT&#039;S DEFIANTLY MY FAULT THEN RIGHT? YEAH, IT WAS. My shoes are in the living room, where my dad was at the time. So I decided to just grab my bag and go as soon as my mother left. I didn&#039;t really know if I think she&#039;d notice, or if she was going to stop me.

You&#039;re probably thinking &quot;Oh hey, why answer me on the last one but say you won&#039;t &quot;dignify me with a response&quot; for the other ones. It&#039;s clearly because everything I said was true, and you have no real response to it.&quot; If you are, sure, go on thinking that. I honestly don&#039;t give a flying shit for trying to justify myself because of your skepticism anymore. Wow I&#039;ve said the word &quot;shit&quot; a lot. I&#039;m sure I sound like an immature brat right now. I&#039;ll end this post simply. I&#039;m not a liar. I&#039;m not consciously craving attention, and I was honestly seeking advise. If you don&#039;t believe me, then there&#039;s nothing I can do about it. This conversation from my point of view has become nothing but defending myself, and isn&#039;t helping me in any way.</div>

I&#039;ll just explain what it&#039;s like to me. With many paranormal phenomenon, I accept them all as openly as a possible. Depending on the subject, I may be even more open to it, such as psychic abilities and Psi.<br />
<br />
For demons, however, I am not <em>as</em> open to. I&#039;ve had minor experiences with &quot;creepy&quot; things in the past but I am not one of those people who immediately label it as a paranormal experience as many other people seem to do. I always blame it on my mind, knowing that it is a powerful thing. One of the things that has also lowered my belief in demons are silly articles written by random people on the internet that seem completely unbelievable. Since there are so many stories, and so many ideas relating to demons it then tells you: <br />
-Only one of those ideas is truly correct<br />
-All of the other ones are completely wrong<br />
-And lastly, the possibility of none of the ideas are correct, or none of the true ideas regarding demons has even been found.<br />
<br />
But anyways, as usual, I have very little ground to defend what I said. I say that because it is true we are on a paranormal website where we talk about a lot of unbelievable things, a lot of which we all do state as real.<br />

I think my biggest problem with astral projection aside from fear is that I can&#039;t quiesce my mind.

I&#039;m having a difficult time just flushing my thought process, at least without drifting off, and if I do drift off I&#039;ll just fall asleep.
