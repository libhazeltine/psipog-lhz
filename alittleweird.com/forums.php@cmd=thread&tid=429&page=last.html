		<div id="post_9427" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">One day, I decided to try a neat idea I had for gathering energy into a ball.<br />
<br />
I created a really large, thin, hollow sphere (taller than me while standing) that was designed to trap energy inside of it out of the air. (Since energy is everywhere.)<br />
<br />
I began shrinking the ball, compressing the energy more and more as the ball shrunk. The more condensed I made the energy inside of the ball, the more this pressure began to build against my right temple. (Against, as in pressing from the outside.)<br />
<br />
Just when I got the ball down to the size of a softball, it felt like something gave way under that pressure, quickly followed by what felt like someone hitting me in the right side of my head with a sledgehammer. It left me dizzy for several minutes.<br />
<br />
After that, when messing with energy, I&#039;d sometimes have a slight headache, just on the right side around my temple. It felt sorta like a stress headache. I didn&#039;t always notice it, but when I thought about it, I could feel the headache.<br />
<br />
Many months later, I was thinking back on it and decided to try a neat idea I had. I gathered energy in the center of my chest, focusing on &quot;repair&quot; and &quot;reinforce&quot;. I think my original idea was to see if I could strengthen whatever was taking that pressure to see if I could increase my limit. As I pushed the energy up into my head and against my right temple from the inside, suddenly I felt like something &quot;popped back&quot; into place.<br />
<br />
I got the headache back a little bit for a while, but I eventually stopped feeling those slight headaches altogether.<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s one time I hurt myself. There is a second time that I&#039;ve done so, which I&#039;ve already mentioned in another topic.<br />
<br />
I was gathering energy all around my body just for kicks one day, and suddenly I felt the quick, painful sensation of being stabbed in the heart with something about as thick as a pencil. A friend of mine told me that I had probably exhausted energy in my body to bring that much energy outside my body, and that having more &#039;pressure&#039; on the outside caused some of it to force its way in to make up for it.</div>

<br />
I have never hurt myself like that, just a slight headache and being tired from once playing with energy, letting it go, but not drawing in anymore(before I knew that it was necesary). <br />
<br />
The only thing I could relate to being injured, I was with my friend and he was shielded(as always) and I tried to essentially ping him, well it backfired and it actually really hurt(I have found it utterly impossible to shield, I don&#039;t know why, but it doesn&#039;t work. I am trying new things, but I can&#039;t get it right, errr).<br />
<br />
Have you ever had someone &quot;invade your head.&quot; That sounds funny, but I could not think of a better way to put it. Well, I have and it left me with the worst headache I have ever had, but during the process there was a distinct feeling, a pressure headache sort of. If that counts, but I didn&#039;t do it to myself.</div>

I concentrated my energy into a very dense, spinning ball around my fist, and I made a punch at someone, stopping about an inch from his arm. He didn&#039;t notice anything at the time, but about an hour later he developed a dark black and blue bruise where I &quot;hit&quot; him... <br />

<br />
It might be a result of draining yourself of spiritual/emotional energy, which your mind needs to create positive outlooks.<br />
<br />
It might be a result of failing to the point that you feel crappy about yourself. <br />
<br />
It might be a result of putting unecessary strain on your body and thinking you are doing something psionic, successfully tiring your body and draining yourself.<br />
<br />
(One big mistake that people make is that they forget that they have the ability to contract their muscles, and when their bodies get hot from contracting their muscles so much, they think its warmth from a psiball.  Continuing to contract your muscles reduces your bloodflow, and eventually if you continue doing it long enough, you will start to feel dizzy as a result of a lack of blood flow to your brain.  Doing that over and over puts severe strain on your body, especially if you don&#039;t take a break once in a while.<br />
<br />
Realize when you are trying to make a psiball, no physical body movement should be necessary.)<br />
<br />
Depression is a serious thing by the way peeps.  If you guys are feeling it during your psionic training (most people don&#039;t identify that they are feeling depressed on their own..), then do the right thing and give yourself a break!!!<br />
<br />
Hurting your mind is much more severe than hurting your body.</div>

Your unable to discount the idea if your keeping your muscles in a taunt state, a person might also just be more conscious of heat or sensation in their hands that the brain would normally filter as useless info and ignore. In the interest of skepticism, people should be aware of these things but yes they can have the result of turning people off to the whole search. I&#039;d argue its better that they be aware of these confusions and possibilities from the beginning to decrease the likelihood that they find out later and give up or deny the point entirely.</div>

When you begin learning psionics, you&#039;re excited and (hopefully) a complete believer in it. When you know what the real possible explanation might be, you have to make a choice of which you are going to believe.</div>

<br />
Personally, I think that we are slowly figuring out a type of human coding language with our bodies. Our bodies actually have muscles that expand and contract the vains in our bodies. This allows for one to radiate of excess heat (or, if one could control these muscles, control energy flows of the body). With this being said, I feel I must point out that heat is energy too. <br />
<br />
Now, our brains pulse electric currents through our nervous system, allowing us to move our bodies. What I have come to believe that we do then we are using energy manipulation is just that, manipulating our bodies energy. We can cause the current to lead out into the muscles which then allow specific areas of the body to radiate heat.<br />
<br />
Now, on the advanced level, I think that it may be possible to take the energy that we used to open up the veins and pulse it out of the body, creating desired effects.<br />
<br />
Another explanation that leads to the same conclusion would be that we use the same venues that we receive information and sense with in the nervous system and force energy out of these points instead of having energy bounce back with the desired information.<br />
<br />
Since both of them seem logical, I  think it&#039;s more of a composition of the two. The muscles that cause the veins to expand work in the case for the more simple designs, but they are mainly a sign of biofeedback... This is the under developed form of energy manipulation (i.e. Using energy from the brain to manipulate energy that is outside of the brain.) The more advanced version is the on in which we put out (and absorb) energy using the Nervous system itself, using the proper triggers, one could, in theory, program reality. Now, all we need is the code eh?<br />
<br />
This is the main reason I study alchemy (and chemistry). I want to figure out the Coding language of reality, and I think that these, if elaborated on, could be the key.</div>

Physics and Quantum physics come closer and closer to reaching the goal of finding the reality of reality, I think, in other words, seeing the Code in action and figuring out how that bit of code works. String theory is something I&#039;m definitely interested in, but until it&#039;s tested, one cannot go any further. <br />

Chemistry may be a theory somewhere at it&#039;s base, however; It&#039;s also scientific convention, just as gravity is. String theory, on the other hand, hasn&#039;t become a scientific convention yet and therefore I cannot proceed along that path without risk of people not believing me. Granted, I will develop connections to string theory, however; I cannot use the connections I make to prove my theory until string theory becomes scientific convention.<br />
<br />
Gravity may be a theory at it&#039;s root, but because of scientific convention, it is now classified as a law. Evolution is still a theory, although a very well accepted theory, because of, if nothing else, religion. As for String theory, I think it has potential and makes sense, but until others feel that way, there&#039;s no point it trying to prove my point using it.</div>
