More enlikely, I think that you may be actually seeing an aura, but because you aren&#039;t observing it long enough, or some other reason, your body can&#039;t detect the color of the aura itself. Maybe I can elaborate on this later?<br />

Second Lesson, feeling the aura.<br />
<br />
Feeling the aura is, technically, something we do every day when we make psi-balls. Let me ellaborate.<br />
<br />
When you create a Psi ball, you are using your bodies energy and forming it into a ball that we can feel and possibly see. (for those wondering, you can see psi-balls with aura sight.) What we are trying to do here is to feel, in the same way we would feel a psi-ball, someone elses aura.<br />
<br />
The goal of this lesson today i to have you all be able to feel someone else&#039;s aura, I find the best way to do this is to just relax and run your hand a little above the body and feel the Aura around their body. Using this technique, you can usually get a feel for where they are in pain by general irregularities in the aura itself.<br />
<br />
Well, to make things simple, I&#039;m going to break off here and allow for everyone to post their questions on this and other lessons.</div>

<br />
Put simply, to detect most emotional pain, it&#039;s ussually represented in the colour of the aura, where as Physical bodyly pain is represented by Tempurature, Texture I&#039;m not to sure about.<br />
<br />
For Basic healing, your only real goal is to feel the aura and try to detect and balance out irregularities with your energy. Advanced healing however tends to be a little more difficult, because you are, in essence, healing the physical by acctually healing the aura. i.e. in advanced healing one needs to combine the visual abnormalities of the aura as well as the heat and textural abnormalities. I will elaborate more on that aspect of healing later on.<br />
<br />
To answer your last question: Yes and No, Through Aura Sight, you can detect a persons attunement (i.e. what &quot;frequency&quot; his/her brain is operating on). By feeling an aura we can detect where in the body physical abnormalities are. Quite frankly, those gifted in Aura-Sight can see much more of the aura than others would normally, seeing the aura expanded a good couple of feet, in that case, it would be much easier to see other abnormalities than just those represented by colours, however; for those without a large amount of training, it&#039;s better to just stick with feeling the aura.<br />

I see auras, I don&#039;t know how to compare that to what other people see, but I used to pick them up in certain instances before I even knew psionics existed, but that is a story for another time. <br />
Anyways, when you say &#039;invisible,&#039; are you meaning like an energy field? The way that I would describe it is the way that heat reflects off of the road on a hot day. It is most definately there, but without a colour? When I first started to actually look for auras that is what I would come up with. I would see that haze radiating off of people/things. Colour came shortly after, slowly at first, kind of a vague colour but now it is usually pretty clear. I think of it as a learning process, you must first learn to observe it(knowing it is there by the haze), then you may examine it(actually detecting colour). Just my thoughts, maybe you are still in this learning process, you can see that it is there, but you are transitioning into being able to see the colour. Anyways, just my thoughs, you asked for them.<br />
<br />
Intense, about only being able to see it around your head being natural, I would say that it could be. When I first started looking for auras, I found the same thing. It frustrated me, but it did not take very long to pick up the rest as well. I think it is kind of a matter of trusting what you are seeing and then developing the &#039;sight.&#039; In other words I guess, training yourself on what to look for. But, that could not be natural, maybe you and I are just oddballs ;)<br />
<br />
Akio, thanks for this thread, I am excited! I am going to have to try this on my friend now, since I would think it would be an invasion of privacy to do to someone who is unaware of it. I had never thought about feeling an aura, I mean the actual aura, people who are empathetic naturally pick up emotions, which(correct me if I am wrong) I kind of think go hand in hand with auras. <br />
Now for my question: How would being empathetic affect the ability to heal/pick up on emotional pain in the aura?<br />
Also, the depth of the aura, how far it extends, do you have anything to say about that? </div>

I think it is kind of a matter of trusting what you are seeing and then developing the &#039;sight.&#039; In other words I guess, training yourself on what to look for. But, that could not be natural, maybe you and I are just oddballs ;)

Akio, thanks for this thread, I am excited! I am going to have to try this on my friend now, since I would think it would be an invasion of privacy to do to someone who is unaware of it. I had never thought about feeling an aura, I mean the actual aura, people who are empathetic naturally pick up emotions, which(correct me if I am wrong) I kind of think go hand in hand with auras. 
Now for my question: How would being empathetic affect the ability to heal/pick up on emotional pain in the aura?
Also, the depth of the aura, how far it extends, do you have anything to say about that?</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_9371" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The exercise Akio describes (and I clarified) is a complicated one, from the point of view of whats happening. I used to practice it in high school but I never got to a point where color came into the picture. The image we used is a good example of biocular illusion. Your staring almost straight on, or so cross eyed that your creating phantom images to your perception. Lining up the middle two causes your brain to associate the information and it drops the colors, so it appears as though you&#039;ve got a white cross.<br />
<br />
If your looking through someone, in the same way you duplicate their image, and it appears as if theres an outline of their body with the solid part being a layering of the two images. Its my theory, though I don&#039;t entirely like it. I&#039;m sure if I looked I&#039;d find a more apt explanation of the illusion.<br />
<br />
I would argue that both color and tactile sensation might be a rather subjective experience. Some people being more visual, intuitive, or tactile, I don&#039;t know that you can say for certain how another person will read an issue in an aura and what it pertains to.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem with color is a thing called synaesthesia, a good number of people have it in some form, it causes you to respond to stimuli with unrelated sensation. Commonly its known for people tasting a shape, smelling a color or some other odd association. A fraction of those will see their own emotional responses to a person as a color or feeling near or around the person (generally it pertains to known people, but it seems to me not out of the question you could cultivate it to work on a level with judging a book by its cover, a mix of trained observation of people and first impression). Its like a person who doesn&#039;t understand that they are cold reading, and mistake themselves for psychic.</div>

<br />
If my theories are correct, the reason people are able to see Auras is because you are pulling a type of over exposion trick with our eyes, in which the natural vibrations meld into our sensation of color. That being said, I don&#039;t think that different healers would see different colours. If you haven&#039;t forgotten (or if you didn&#039;t know) I am, infact, giving lessons based off of rigorous standards of theory, or atleast well established theories developed in Eastern Traditions.<br />
<br />
Although I am not trying to put anyone down, If one makes something personal, they put their ego into it by liking it, which in turn brings in duality, which goes back to the fundamental flaw mentioned in my previous post. No, Under my understanding, I can say that we first saw these colours and then made an association to them, just as any science.<br />
<br />
As for feeling the aura, I don&#039;t often do advanced healings on people, so I&#039;m really not sure, however, one should not try to assign different feelings to different problems, but rather observe how the feelings you get relate to the problems that they have. This is probably why it&#039;s best to start with those diagnosed through other methods and observe the effects that particular problem creates in the aura. This will not only help you in your healing, but keep you from making a misdiagnosis because your ego got in the way ^_^.<br />

First he acknowledged a negative area in my aura/psi and asked if there was something there.  I had a cut on my leg that had scabbed up, but I had recently peeled off the scab.  He said he focused on that area of my leg and &quot;layered&quot; the wound with psi.  As he did, I felt a pleasurable tingling sensation.  My skin slowly returned to normal, in a few hours, there was no sign of a scar, a cut, a scab, anything.  <br />

		<div id="post_9563" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Lesson Three, Basic Healing Techniques.<br />
<br />
Okay! Time for yet another lesson, I will be answering any question from this point on, so feel free to ask away. I&#039;ve been a little cramped lately and I realized that I needed to post another lesson and get this thread moving ^_^.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few basic healing techniques that one may go about using. In this lesson, however; I will go over some of the techniques I use for basic healing and those that I specialize in to keep it simple. If you would like me to give you any more techniques or elaborate on the ones I have, all that you need to do is ask.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Basic healing is pretty simple. The first thing that you need to do it register the problem areas of the aura using the feeling method described in lesson two (seeing the aura is helpful in telling who needs treatment, but because people are usually more versed in the feeling technique, I find that this is a better way of diagnosing.<br />
<br />
The next thing one must do is put energy into these problem areas (or in some cases one can just put energy into the body). This helps the healing process move faster than usual. Be careful, the more energy you use in a healing the lower your immune system tends to drop.

Okay! Time for yet another lesson, I will be answering any question from this point on, so feel free to ask away. I&#039;ve been a little cramped lately and I realized that I needed to post another lesson and get this thread moving ^_^.

There are quite a few basic healing techniques that one may go about using. In this lesson, however; I will go over some of the techniques I use for basic healing and those that I specialize in to keep it simple. If you would like me to give you any more techniques or elaborate on the ones I have, all that you need to do is ask.

Basic healing is pretty simple. The first thing that you need to do it register the problem areas of the aura using the feeling method described in lesson two (seeing the aura is helpful in telling who needs treatment, but because people are usually more versed in the feeling technique, I find that this is a better way of diagnosing.

The next thing one must do is put energy into these problem areas (or in some cases one can just put energy into the body). This helps the healing process move faster than usual. Be careful, the more energy you use in a healing the lower your immune system tends to drop. I find that healthy diet and exercise can help to expand normal energy levels and raise one&#039;s immune system.

I´m also curious about what you see when you use aura sight to look at a psiball. I tried that yesterday when I made a psiball and what I saw was a small line around the ball but with some gaps and no colour.<br />
