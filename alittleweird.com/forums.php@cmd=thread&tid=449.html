<br />
I define meditation a discipline in which one attempts to get beyond the conditioned, &quot;thinking&quot; mind into a deeper state of relaxation or awareness.<br />
<br />
The thing that works best for me would have to be sitting in the lotus Position, either full or half, and letting my body relax. I control my heartbeat, it&#039;s rhythm is my mantra, and I let my state of conscience go deeper and deeper as my body refreshes itself with energy. I eventually hit theta and then delta, and I feel my connection to everything intensified, I am not just part of reality, I am reality.<br />
<br />
This is where the fun begins, I can control things freely within myself on the basic energy state. I haven&#039;t gotten past that, but I have been able to create myself alternate worlds in which I can move freely, even though at the same time, I can the &quot;real&quot; world around me. It&#039;s really amazing...<br />
<br />
After meditation I feel completely restores in energy and at peace. My family thinks that I lighten up after meditation, and I&#039;m more relaxed and relaxing to be around ^_^...<br />
<br />
As for preparation, there&#039;s none unless for specific purpose.<br />

<br />
I rather prefer to be laying down, my posture is weak so trying to sit straight is half the job otherwise. I should probably get into yoga for the sake of my body, but as Akio has pointed out; I&#039;m more about theory and ideas than practice. :P<br />
<br />
I have felt a bit energized after meditation but I always seem to be on a low battery so  post meditation feels like half full at best. During though I do feel as though my body is very still, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d use the word relaxed. Gravity is certainly having its way with my jaw and such, but I wouldn&#039;t describe it as &#039;feeling&#039; relaxed. I have been rather taken lately with watching the kind of speckled waves of color that appear while in a dark room with your eyes closed.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really prepare anything, maybe plug in headphones and turn on some sound.</div>

before you start doing the ocean breath, inhale deeply, and when you exhale, breathe out through your mouth like the way you would when you fog your glasses or a mirror.<br />
<br />
when you get the hang of this, try to inhale and exhale again, this time with your mouth closed. you might hear some sounds coming out from your mouth, and it sounds like the ocean.(thats why its called the ocean breath).<br />

i personally find that whenever i do the ocean breath, i would &#039;sink&#039; into my subconscious state very fast, and so my meditation feels much better.</div>

<br />
While in meditation, rather than deep, calming breaths, you want to take a little shorter breaths than you would on when acting normally. keep your mind focused, but relaxed at you breath. Then, while keeping your breath relatively within the same region, shift your focus towards your eyes. At this point you may feel a pain in the third eye area, this is normal, but even at that, prolonged periods in this state is not recommended.<br />
<br />
The Idea here is to keep your meditation strict and precise, rather than a deep trance. It is to be kept in mind that the Alpha brainwave is all around a feeling of alert calmness, so the normal approach to meditation often will lead one to break from ones alertness.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got for that. I hope it helps, by the way, you planning anything for this or just want to know what it feels like?<br />

(note: you can do this meditation with your eyes open if you want) <br />

<br />
As for more soothing, I would recommend the basic energy gathering meditation. For this, just breath deep, let yourself relax. With each breath, feel the energy coming from the earth, up through your legs and spine to your core, and then out to the rest of your body.<br />
<br />
Hold that energy and let it fill you for a few minutes, while continuing your breathing. Just let the energy cycle through you for a while and let yourself relax. Breath a little while longer before opening your eyes to the outside world. You may end up seeing your aura (I see it around my eyes when I do this, as well as around my body vividly).<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The other thing I could recommend for you, if you want to move deeper into alpha state (without the headache), is to combine this technique with the first one I gave you. Start with the first technique and then slowly adjust your breathing to the second technique, and carry out with that technique until the end. The final result should be the half awareness of what&#039;s around you, with a sense of peace, and an overall reflective state of mind.<br />
<br />
This area is good for learning and reflecting on things, but it is time consuming to try this particular technique out, so I would set a good chunk of time aside for it.<br />
<br />
Good luck Linked ^_^</div>
