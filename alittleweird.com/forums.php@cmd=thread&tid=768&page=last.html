		<div id="post_14055" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">This is would be an amazing idea, yet I found a couple of opportunities. Feelings are retrospective to the individual.<br />
<br />
 Why are some people masochists and others fear pain for their lives? Both of the inquired parties have a different opinion on the matter. One feels a sense of euphoric rush while the other is experiencing an overwhelming fear, yet now that I write this down they both experience a euphoric rush in retrospect to their own tastes of pleasure.<br />
<br />
 This brings up two more questions in my mind. What about the people who just ignore the feelings and go with the flow,(exp. sociopaths) or how far do we boil down a part of an emotion(or whole) before it becomes a mathematical equation, or a solid theory of emotions? I have friends whom are &quot;sociopaths&quot; that just do not feel. They do whatever they like whenever. This would be that enough of a percentage to flaw the whole plan <br />
<br />
Also classifying emotions &quot;by hand&quot; would be like physically taking apart the DNA of an organism and classifying each subdivision of protein. Starting from a very general view would also be like simulating the equitation through the Rubik&#039;s Cube for 5000 years, yet if you try to make the classification as small as possible it would be retrospect to the society that created it because we would have to go through society deemed emotions and what they are suppose to feel.<br />
<br />
On the other hand contrary to those beliefs, we still have the fact that they both felt the primal emotion of a euphoric rush so it could be done. With some unexplained exceptions from time to time. </div>

It&#039;s true that the way someone reacts to a feeling/emotion or how they feel it depends on a person&#039;s experience and notions. Afterall it may aswell be like that thread where someone said that what it&#039;s red to me it&#039;s green to you but we call it blue.<br />
