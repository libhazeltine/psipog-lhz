		<div id="post_7872" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So, this is what I&#039;ve been seeing lately.<br />
<br />
Two weeks ago I decided I needed to start following through with my plans. I realized that it is better to start &#039;acting&#039; on your instincts to accomplish something then to sit around and try and figure out what to accomplish. I have had a little more energy than usual, and feel like I&#039;m getting a little more things done than normal.<br />
<br />
Now; Several days after I realized I wanted to uh, improve my situation, a friend forwards me an email he gets that&#039;s like one of those motivational e-mails from some guy who sells, call it motivation. It&#039;s about focusing and acting on your goals, and even if you don&#039;t have goals, to start acting on what you already know about yourself and what you want. As time goes on, I start doing a little more here and there, and start knocking out the small things I have been putting aside. There have been several small things up to this moment that have made me say &quot;Huh, I&#039;ve been thinking about this.&quot; Or &quot;Hmm, I&#039;ve had this idea in my head for a little while.&quot; And now a blog I read normally (steve pavlina&#039;s) has a piece on acting on things you know rather than waiting for the &quot;new great idea&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t help but feel like that&#039;s a sign saying &quot;You&#039;re on the right track.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the cynic in me says, &quot;Coincidence&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re making something out of nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
From where you stand, if this happened to you. How would you react?</div>

The real Question you should be asking yourself is whether the changes are good or bad? If there for the good, and you truly believe that, then to hell if it&#039;s just coincidence, it&#039;s still happening and you are still experiencing it, so why not make the best out of it?</div>

<br />
If you see one that repeats itself way too many times, however, you are better off ignoring it and saving yourself the torment. I literally wish I had a dollar for every time I &quot;just so happened to&quot; look at a clock when it &quot;just so happened to&quot; read &quot;9:11&quot;. Eventually, I just stopped caring about it. I always knew that it probably didn&#039;t mean anything because I knew that, if it did, there wouldn&#039;t be much of a point of it repeating itself so many times in such an ambiguous manner. Repetitive symbolism is almost meaningless. I&#039;d rather hold onto my sanity than be that open minded.<br />
<br />
I even have my own proverb that concerns the act of keeping an open mind. It goes like this,<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
One-time coincidences, on the other hand, are worth looking at in a positive light. Such coincidences will at least give you hope for what could be. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, you do sound like you are on the right track, so keep at it.<br />

		<div id="post_7908" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The discussion is really the same as Vimick&#039;s topic on coincidences and a few of Sean&#039;s blogs. I&#039;m a firm believer Synchronicity is just random events or a subconscious direction; you put yourself into situations with some semblance of a direction and the human mind has an affinity for both finding patterns and associating knowledge for easier recall. At the same time though even I&#039;m a little surprised.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been playing with the permanent magnet motor and my theory on that point is pretty complete until i actually build a model, so tonight i was reading up on electrical generator. One article put forth the idea that if you were to take one of the small motors and set up a string so you could turn it, it would produce electricity. I thought to myself, hmm, i&#039;ve got one of those laying around somewhere and tried to look for it to play with. Checking various spots in my room I discover an old kit to build an electric motor that can be put in a plastic boat husk to create a working motorboat.<br />
<br />
Certainly my brain knew it was in there, but to me it was a re-discovery of something after 5-10+ years. More on the side of randomness though, I was up late earlier this week watching the sub of the newest Naruto movie and a guy IMed me. Apparently his chat program of choice has a feature to generate the name of someone online to talk to, and it choose me.  I&#039;d been thinking about traveling(leaning toward walking) across the US taking only maybe a sleeping bag, the clothing I was wearing and a debit card; Get to talking to the guy and turns out hes the same age and contemplating a similar trip(he was thinking primarily buses though), its crazy because even if he did know me I&#039;ve not mentioned the idea to anyone.<br />
<br />
I can see the grounds for believing in a cosmic alignment pretty clearly but still have to believe its more likely just a combination of chance and both conscious and subconscious direction.</div>
