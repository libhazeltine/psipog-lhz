I’m finding that I’m experiencing lucid dreams more and more frequently, which is great right? Wrong! <br />
<br />
Here’s a typical lucid dream: <br />
1)	Become conscious.<br />
2)	Go about my business, la de da.<br />
3)	Realise I’m lucid, do whatever.<br />
4)	Get bored, try to wake up.<br />
5)	Can’t wake up!<br />
6)	Can’t wake up!<br />
7)	Can’t wake up!<br />
8)	Wake up.<br />
The other day after a long struggle I finally opened my eyes (in real life), but it was like the image in my dream was imprinted over what my eyes could see, things got a little messy from there: I did not return to sleep ( lots of coffee).<br />
I’m not sure if this is normal, if anything can be normal within the paranormal, but I would appreciate your thoughts.<br />

It is hilarious, when you combine a sleepy mind with 100% authentic imaginery. It is actually funny to end up crouching behind your chair just to evade that horrible dinosaur, who was sitting next to you a few seconds ago.<br />

What exactly do you mean by being unable to wake up?<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t you open your eyes?<br />
Can&#039;t you move your limbs?<br />
Can&#039;t you think clearly?<br />

If you are conscious, it might be a variations of a sleep paralysis. Harmless jest of our minds... Then again, it might just be that you have discovered something interesting from your brains. </div>

<br />
the same way you can trigger a lucid dream by remembering some sort of anchor to clue you in to being dreaming, perhaps there is something you can setup for your mind and/or body so that you can trigger a wake-up.<br />
<br />
i cant think of anything off-hand particularly... maybe a codeword? as you go to sleep tell(repeat to) yourself that if you say the word &quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; you will automatically become completely concious and awake (and return to your body if you think you may be leaving it) with no adverse effects or difficulty.<br />
<br />
as with lucid dream triggering and seeding, it will probably take time and practice, but if you are diligent with whatever you decide to use as an anchor/trigger i imagine you can use it as a rope to climb out.</div>

 I like the theory that someone else placed about you being in sleep paralysis at the time. If that&#039;s true, and you feel comfortable enough, maybe you could broaden your experiences and gives yourself the chance to have an OBE out of a lucid dream?</div>

In my dream i woke up in bed and didn&#039;t realise that i was sleeping, i turned on my side to see what the time was but when i looked at the clock my ceiling fan as on it.  this made me realise i was dreaming and i woke up... i opened my eyes and everything was back to normal, so i got out of bed and suddenly my vision became blurry and i realised i was dreaming and i woke up... once again i opened my eyes to the exact same scene... the only difference was that this time i realised i was dreaming and it started to scare me.  i went through what seemed like hundreds of different scenarios in which i explored my room i could do anything i wanted except leave, and as soon as i left the bed i would awaken, so i kept a hand on my bed as i tried to find away to wake up.  after what seemed like a life time i began to fear that in real life i was in a coma or something and that i would always be stuck in this dream, never leaving my room.  the next time i woke  up however, there was this man i had never seen before sitting on my bed next to me.  he just stared at me.  i freaked out and jumped out of the bed hoping that when i awoke in the next dream he would be gone. But he wasnt.  after a while i asked him if he realised that he was in my dream. he said that he was fully aware of everything that was happening. he said that i was stuck inside a dream held within an infinite amount of dreams.. and that no matter how hard i tried to get out id be stuck there forever.then he was gone.  anyways cutting this already very long story i finally realised that if i concentrated hard enough and rolled my body over in real life id wake up.. which is what happened.<br />

Although, when I tried the rolling over trick ( in desperation) I just sort of kept rolling and rolling and rolling for what seemed like ages, accompanied with my muffled screams, then I did wake up. I suspect some comments people have made about calming down are correct, it’s probably like the old Chinese finger trap, right?<br />
<br />
What interests me now is that person who spoke to you, because I had a similar experience. I was lucid, and someone spoke to me and this person knew that I was lucid, so everything they said had significance. It was like another being talking to me, or my subconscious, I could feel the importance in what was being said to me like an important message. And the last thing this person said to me was “This is not a dream” this echoed until I awoke.<br />
<br />
So I wonder, ( I should really make a different thread for this right?) are there messages or truths to be found whilst you are lucid. People talk about being able to control their world whilst lucid, something that I’m often not able to do, is there significance in what people tell you, or what you see and where you are, and can maybe reap the benefits of being able to read the innermost parts of your mind?<br />
<br />
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.<br />

I suspect some comments people have made about calming down are correct, it’s probably like the old Chinese finger trap, right?

What interests me now is that person who spoke to you, because I had a similar experience. I was lucid, and someone spoke to me and this person knew that I was lucid, so everything they said had significance. It was like another being talking to me, or my subconscious, I could feel the importance in what was being said to me like an important message. And the last thing this person said to me was “This is not a dream” this echoed until I awoke.

So I wonder, ( I should really make a different thread for this right?) are there messages or truths to be found whilst you are lucid. People talk about being able to control their world whilst lucid, something that I’m often not able to do, is there significance in what people tell you, or what you see and where you are, and can maybe reap the benefits of being able to read the innermost parts of your mind?

		<div id="post_7403" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">yeah i have wondered about the person that had spoken to me too.  this i thought was probably the most note worthy part of the dream.  As he was someone id never seen well presented in a suit sitting on my bed.  he seemed kind of amused as he told me that i was stuck in the dream forever and that i could never get out, but honestly i think that it was because of what he said that let me finally get out.  and just like your dream his words did keep echoing until i broke free of the dream.<br />
<br />
i think its possible that it was the subconscious trying to help me awaken.  but id like to think it was something or someone else helping me get out:P <br />

its all very interesting</div>

		<div id="post_7569" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I used to have really strange and vivid dreams that I could not wake up from until it seemed like a day was up. It was almost like I was switching from one reality to another. Some of my memories are actually from them as if they were reality at one time... I was okay with these dreams until they started manipulating my fears and using them against me. I would have these scary (for lack of a better word) dreams that I could not wake up from. What worked for me was, in my dream somehow, I gained full control of what my dream body did. If I closed my eyes for enough in my dream, I would wake up in reality, almost as if my dream self fell asleep.<br />
My suggestion is trying to gain control over your dream form and finding something that works to get you out.</div>
