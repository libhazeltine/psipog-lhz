<br />
Twice today I&#039;ve felt huge pains throughout my body... I figured out later that this was due to severe dehydration. on the three days before (in which I drank next to nothing other that 3 energy drinks which dehydrate you even faster -_-), I found that my aura reached a bright white, with an an outward tinge of bright purple. As anyone who has studied aura&#039;s would, I immediately freaked out. An aura like that is a classic sign of death...<br />
<br />
I ended up getting sharp pains all over my body, coupled with small spasms, almost like my body was overheating and short-circuiting. I couldn&#039;t do anything about it at school, so when I went home a drank a glass of Apple Juice (I don&#039;t trust the city water supply and we didn&#039;t have any bottled water stored). I started to feel a little better. The funny thing is that I lost nearly all sense of the energy around me... With that being said, tomorrow I&#039;m going to be buying a surplus of bottled water and begin a new experiment.<br />
<br />
What I want to do if conduct an experiment to see how certain chemicals affect my body in the spiritual (as well as water, considering what happened to me over the past couple of days). <br />
<br />
I need suggestions, any that you could give before I start would be greatly appreciated... Any comments or questions are also allowed and accepted greatly, I&#039;m not sure what I can answer, but I will try as much as I can.<br />
<br />
I will post a plan, and a log of my experiment as it happens, which should be next week.<br />
<br />
Things that I will need:<br />
<br />
-Food lists, I want to stick to a relatively controlled diet as I do this, otherwise I may end up with a corrupt experiment. I am going to use this diet as both my controlled variable and a constant.<br />
<br />
-An independent variable, that should I change each day before the practice? I have a few Ideas, but I want to hear what you have first!<br />
<br />
-A few volunteers to follow the same tests who can log their results as well. If I did this on my own, It could easily be claimed as a corrupt test and considered useless to the scientific community.<br />
<br />

You&#039;d want to keep track of your diet(what/how much/maybe even when) and feelings/moods/health over a period of a year or more. Other people would certainly be more data but not necessarily useful in comparing against one another; because of differences in biology, constants would be limited to yourself and your diet.<br />
<br />
If you were to have everyone get full medical testing before hand, then you might be able to consider some things as constants between people but again it would be complicating matters more than it would yield reliable results.</div>

This may be somewhat tedious but still.<br />
My theory is that lots of Fish, vegitables and natural drinks will increase your psionic capabilities. I have noticed my self that soda make capacity go down. last week i ate no meat and my telepathic capabilities increased. but when i drink a lot  of soda in a week i have trouble with everything. so have fun. maybe i will try some of this too.</div>

Give me a list of edible food that probably wont kill me and let&#039;s see what will happen ^_^, of course I prefer the type of food that are expected to enhance your spiritual performance, I mean that&#039;s what we are aiming for right? Not the ones that can harm our bodies, since it would be bad to test those food out...<br />
<br />
<br />
suggestions: Apple, Fried chicken, beef burgers, pizzas, water, potato chips(barbecue flavor preferred), weed, cereal, banana, very spicy stuff (pepper would be nice), rice, and peach.<br />
I will be more than happy to keep a consistent diet of whatever I listed above ^_^, And to my test results, apple seems to help me boost my concentration(I tested on eating it everyday).<br />
I am testing friend chicken atm( 2 pounds of chicken a day, 0.0, all I need to eat LOL), I&#039;m testing pizzas with chicken, I&#039;ll do it separately after I get some results ^^.<br />

PS: I&#039;m not fat yet...<br />
