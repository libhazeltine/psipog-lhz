I&#039;ve spread the &quot;word&quot; for about 5 years now, and it has positive effects to someones (not all of them). The more you are open to new experiences, the more you will see. It&#039;s not all about PSI (or whatever you decide the name to be for that kind of energy), but it&#039;s more like acceptance of things happening. If you let them happen and just follow the flow, I think you master in it in no time :)<br />

Namaste.</div>Well it does make one wonder about the other forum members. But most of them have been in the Psi community for a long time. They have seen a lot of stuff like this before, kinda. So they equate it to what is termed &#039;fluff-bunnies&#039;. At least thats my theory any way. I in no way speak for anyone on these forums save for myself. So I guess that the other members will just have to explain themselves. If they feel like it that is.</div>

		<div id="post_13275" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">During the last summer suddenly out of nowhere I saw two weird dreams.<br />
In one of them, my best friend had passed away and I remember asking him for the reason while I was talking with his ghost.<br />
The second dream: I saw myself waking up in a really beautiful graveyard. It was a foggy morning and I remember seeing all kinds of flowers everywhere. Because of the fog I could see nothing but the graveyard. While I was enjoying the graveyard and its beauty (I had (in the dream) and have (in reality) never seen such a beautiful graveyard before), I suddenly sensed my father coming. It was then that the fog lifted and father took me with him.<br />
<br />
About two weeks ago I saw a dream where first our dog went crazy followed by other family members. When I was walking the dog, it killed someone I wasn&#039;t able to recognize in the dream. Then my grandfather killed it. After that my sister went crazy and tried to commit suicide - fortunately she failed. Some cities were in total chaos (full of people trying to kill themselves). &lt;- the whole dream was a total mess..<br />
<br />
Well, that may have been the result of playing Stalker. However, I usually memorize only the dreams that differ from the others (and I didn&#039;t see anything abnormal in the dreams before nor after the dream).<br />
<br />
That was until yesterday. <br />
I was slowly walking towards our tent in the woods when it began to rain. However, it             wasn&#039;t a normal rain - it gave off a disgusting smell of sulphur &amp; ammonium - and it could easily penetrate tree leaves and other thin materials. I arrived at the tent where others were hiding. They had somehow reinforced the walls of the tent so that it was safe in there. After the raining stopped, I saw a satellite recording the event and felt that the catastrophe had actually been caused by humans.<br />
<br />
These have been the recent dreams that remind me of something weird coming. Actually, it feels weird that nothing seems to have happened yet..</div>
