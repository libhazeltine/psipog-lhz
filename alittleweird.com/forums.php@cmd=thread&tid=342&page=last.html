		<div id="post_7886" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yes,this thread is related to weird discussions...it&#039;s about remote viewing<br />
Well,it was not too long ago when I was at some site for quizzes.It was a big site,with all kinds of different quizzes from &quot;IQ test&quot; to &quot;How emo are you?&quot;.After a few days on that site I began wondering does it have any tests about psi and that kind of stuff.And of course,it had.So,I,like a total nerd began taking each one of them until I reached the &quot;How gifted are you?&quot; or whatever.<br />
And I began,and did it kinda good :/ what was more interesting happened at the middle of the quizz,on the Remote viewing part.There was this big square gray box,and you had to tell what&#039;s behind it.I looked at it,and after a few moments the box became kinda blurry at the edges...I was thinking that maybe I&#039;m doing the right thing,but I never saw anything more than that.(Interesting part is that I could stare like that for minutes without blinking)<br />
So the next day I was at school and I had some free time,so I began watching at the floor,until it became blurry...I continued this for a few minutes,and everything slowly became one gray-ish color.Like,there was this white piece of paper on the brown floor,but I couldn&#039;t tell where the piece is - everything became sooo blurry.And then I moved and it broke down.<br />
After school I went to gotpsi.com and got better results than last time...so my eye condition is helping me in remote viewing. :D<br />
<br />
Er...anyone here who can do that? Or maybe it&#039;s something like an eye glitch,but I searched the net and found nothing.Am I just being stupid?</div>

Could be a false cause-&gt;effect chain too.<br />

Eyes can do all kinds of crap. If I stare something enough, My whole vision gradually fades to black or white. No idea why though. Generally moving your eyes or head tend to cancel the effect.<br />
<br />
Might have something to do with the fact that we can actually see a very small area sharply. Our brain generates the rest with the help of our peripheral vision.<br />
<br />
You could try repeating this glitch over and over again. I doubt there is any harm in that.<br />
Then if your results get consistently better... Well, do some more eye games.<br />
More power to you.<br />
