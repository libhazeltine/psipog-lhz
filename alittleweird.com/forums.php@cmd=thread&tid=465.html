Has any of you heard of a term &quot;chakra&quot;? This term is often mentioned in hindu texts. Chakras are energy-centers inside our body. They are able to absorb energy from the surroundings.<br />
<br />
For a normal person their chakras rotate just fast enough to maintain energy levels  needed by our body. but when you activate your chakras and give it more energy, with time you might gain some psychic abilities. For example: If your heart chakra was active, it would increase your emapthy skill. <br />
<br />
If your third eye in crown chakra is active, your intuitive powers increase. <br />
and you might be better at remote viewing and clairvoyance.<br />
I have never seen anything about chakras anywhere in this site though....<br />
<br />
I would like to put this up for discussion.<br />

well i know this things about chakras sounds quite incredible and untrue, but its ok. when i first read about chakras, i found it quite incredible too. but then, i always thought that one should believe that something will work if he wants it to work.for the psions, you have might have also thought that psychic skills sounded like fantasy and like a dream before you started practising, but then now you know that psychic powers are definitely real and not some made-up fairytale story. for me, after putting aside my doubts and following the exercises to develop my chakras for some time, i realised that my intuition has become better, and sometimes i could know what a person was going to say before he even said it. in short, you have to believe that it will work before you will see results.</div>

btw, if you scroll to the bottom of every page in the site, you&#039;ll find a link with a hand image. this link goes to the next page. but then you should practise in stages as the site emphasises.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10215">whenever i visualise the temple its overall shape always seem blur faraway. when i go near it i tend to focus more on the long flight of steps at the temple, so i&#039;ve hardly noticed the temple&#039;s design. i focus more on the adytum in the temple. in my mind i would see a big altar in front of me with a flame burning on it(never saw what was burning on the altar though). not only this, i never got to see any figurines of deities or any holy symbols in this temple.

@tancy90<br />
If you are feeling depressed, sad, dull or have any other negative emotions, i would recommend you to try meditation or centering instead. if you try to develop your chakras while you are feeling negative, you might bring in negative energy into your body, and that wouldn&#039;t be good.<br />
when your chakras are developed to a certain extent, you would feel calm and you wouldn&#039;t be pressurised so easily by things you encountered.</div>

From what I&#039;ve been seeing, it seems that aura&#039;s have many layers... each layer spans out more and more.<br />

What it seems like is the further away in layers you get, the more towards the subconscious you are. These aura&#039;s seem to span out pretty far, some even too infinity. The funny thing is though that the further out you get, the fainter the color... maybe this is a visual show of the collective subconsciousness?<br />
<br />
Also, other interesting things about the aura is that each layer&#039;s length depends on spiritual insight, understanding, and awareness... It&#039;s weird ^_-.<br />

As for more physical effects, I have huge amounts of energy control and now can throw psi balls and he like without much effort. I have a lot more balance than I did before, and I have a higher sense of precognition (I can call quarters with over 80% accuracy..).<br />
<br />
On another note, I think I&#039;ve been attacked by a spirit or something cause I tend to get shark pains along my body after seeing a faint outline of an aura... maybe and maybe not, but IDK if it&#039;s real, so I&#039;m not going to get into that. &lt;(^_^&lt;)</div>

wow your third eye chakra is well developed, to be able to view auras. i searched the net and found out that when you practise aura vision, you also stimulate your third eye chakra and make it develop. do you just do exercises for your third eye chakra, or do you do exercises for all the 7 major chakras of your body?<br />
<br />
word of advice to everyone here: its better to develop all your chakras than to concentrating on developing one chakra only. this is to keep all your chakras balanced, meaning all your chakras are equally developed and moving energy at the same rate in your body.</div>
