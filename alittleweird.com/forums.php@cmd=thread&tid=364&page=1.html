		<div id="post_8152" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I sometimes find that I can get psychic impressions of what people are like even over the internet. The only problem I am having is distinguishing between whether or not these are actual psychic impressions or just my interpretation of the tone used in their words.<br />
<br />
Despite this confusion, there was a case in which I was convinced that I was receiving a genuine psychic impression of someone back in the day of psipog.<br />
<br />
He was a moderator who seemed to have great composure, maturity, and refined online manners, but I always felt something sinister and fake about this superficial impression.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, he was actually a very rude and contemptuous person hiding behind this facade of benevolence and proper behavior.<br />
<br />
Inversely, there was someone else who exuded this superficial personality, but I did not feel anything contradicting lying behind it. They both appeared similar on the surface, but only one of them was being his true self.<br />
<br />
I do not wish to disclose the identities of these two persons for their sake and my own sake, so please don&#039;t try to guess or squeeze it out of me.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon? Any thoughts and theories? <br />
<br />
I realize that I am going to receive a lot of skepticism. *sigh* At least skepticism is usually a denotation of higher intelligence and consideration. That&#039;s one of the things that I like about this website: Most of us are self-righteous bastards who can actually think for ourselves and disagree with each other XD. <br />
<br />
NOTE: When I say &quot;Do you sometimes feel that you can tell what a person is like...&quot; I am referring to a person&#039;s outward personality that you would notice in person or even over the phone (i.e. outgoing, quiet, serious, mean, kind, laid back, rude, polite, etc.).</div>

Also, I&#039;d like to add something that I forgot to mention earlier. I agree that this could be some form of empathy, but I find it strange because I&#039;ve never considered myself to be empathic. Ironically, I am a rather emotionless person, so I should technically be a perfect candidate for reading people&#039;s emotions, yet I doubt that I really have read other people&#039;s emotions. Whether or not it IS empathy has yet to be determined. As far as I am concerned, one may be able simply sense a person&#039;s personality through simple psychic reception or may be able to deduce what a person&#039;s overall superficial personality is composed of via the analysis of the results of distant empathy.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then I&#039;d have to say that you, RazSh18, are using empathy, while I, am using simple psychic reception. If I am using empathy, this would mean that I am just not aware enough of it to notice that it is subtle distant empathy.</div>

		<div id="post_8167" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve noticed that different features of a person can be used to determine many different things, the persons personality, their job, whether they&#039;re a righty or a lefty, whether their lying or not when they speak to you, if you have a good enough memory you can even figure out how people&#039;s names, adresses, and personal information at a glance, It&#039;s simple observations, something that both mine and Wandering Wolf&#039;s Beliefs are based on. <br />

<br />
Psychic Reception is different from Empathy, vastly. The main difference is that Psychic reception has a much shorter range and doesn&#039;t just encompass reading emotions, but also thoughts and sometimes people with simple reception can really detect the psysical aspects of other people, like pain, for instance. Whereas Empathy Has a Huge range and is very clear, mainly because it only deals specifically with sensing emotions.<br />
<br />
Someone&#039;s picture or face in genneral is able to reveal people&#039;s greater personality. It&#039;s a Science, a complicated one, but still, at that.<br />
<br />
Psychic Reception as a whole can dectect subtle emotions only at a small radius, and can only sense very, very powerful emotions over a large distance.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Empathy isn&#039;t effected by distance, Psychic reception, however, is.<br />
<br />
I would recommend, to all of you, to learn both and then Look at the differences yourself.<br />

Akio, I will respond to your post on this thread as well as your post on the &quot;weird experiences&quot; thread later on today (I am going to be occupied for a while), but first I am obligated to respond to Dash&#039;s post to clear up this unfortunate misunderstanding between him and I.<br />
<br />
@Dash<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">you talk like a genius and you have wise input..</div>A genius I am not. I don&#039;t pretend to be one either. I&#039;m just naturally articulate. It&#039;s all about the way I was raised. I cannot help it. I&#039;m sorry if it seems like an act to you. As for feeling that my own input is wise, I can only say that you are again mistaken. I often worry that I am going to sound stupid and foolish when I post here because I am surrounded by so many intellectuals with so much psychic and psionic experience, while I, have very little experience and limited knowledge on the subjects. I often just theorize and come up with new ideas, so I take a risk everytime I do so. I usually get quite surprised when people agree with what I have to say. It is not my place to deem whether or not my input is wise, that is for others to determine. <br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">but you just cut me and Razsh18 down</div>First of all, how did I cut RazSh18 down? Can you explain please? As for &quot;cutting [you] down&quot;, that was not the intention. All I was doing was expressing my own claim. You can debate it with me if you&#039;d like.<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">and put yourself on a pedestal, for stuff you assumed no less</div>When I read the part about putting myself on a pedastal, I almost laughed. It was funny because I never felt like I was doing anything like that. It wouldn&#039;t be the first time someone got a strange impression that I was some kind of arrogant jerk. It really hurts my feelings when people make assumptions like that because I know, for a fact, that those same people would take back what they said if they were to meet me in person. I hate and stay away from arrogant people, so it is one of the greatest insults a person can bestow upon me to assume that I am arrogant without even meeting me in person. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the only thing I ASSUMED was that it could be distant empathy or distant psychic reception. If you think that I assumed that photographs are not useful in picking up psychic impressions, you are mistaken. I was not assuming that, I was ASSERTING that because I had analyzed it many times and come to a logical conclusion.<br />
<br />
However, at some point during the creation of this very post, I realized that viewing a photograph could trigger an elucidating psychic response. In other words, I will concede that you could have a point. I&#039;m just saying that we need to be careful not to confuse psychic insight with plain visual observation.<br />
<br />
One last thing: I have a feeling that you are still going to respond negatively to this, thinking that I am lecturing you from my &quot;pedestal&quot;.<br />
<br />
This once happened with an online friend of mine. She thought that, when I &quot;corrected&quot; her, that I was doing so condenscendingly. I had to apologize to her in a variety of ways while explaining that that was simply not the case.<br />
<br />
When I &quot;correct&quot; people, I &quot;correct&quot; them to help them out, not to embarrass and/or insult them, so please try to understand where I am coming from. If people that I unintentionally offend online could at least hear my grim and somewhat monotonous voice they would understand that I am not speaking to them condescendingly.<br />
<br />
Sadly, we do not have that luxury, so I can only hope that others will not misinterpret my intentions.</div>

Okay, here is the reply I promised you for this thread:<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">I&#039;ve noticed that different features of a person can be used to determine many different things, the persons personality, their job, whether they&#039;re a righty or a lefty, whether their lying or not when they speak to you, if you have a good enough memory you can even figure out how people&#039;s names, adresses, and personal information at a glance, It&#039;s simple observations, something that both mine and Wandering Wolf&#039;s Beliefs are based on. <br />
<br />
(If I&#039;m incorrect on the last part wandering wolf, please correct me if I am wrong)</div>When you mention that it is what our beliefs are based on, it reminds me of one of my mottos: Science before psionics. You sound like you have definitely made it into a respectable science of its own. I very much doubt that I am as skilled as you in that area. I can only deduce so much from my observations.<br />
<br />
I can often derive multiple assumptions based on what people wear, drive, listen to, etc. Who people associate with, what their hobbies are, and how they express themselves can also be very useful in gathering potentially valid data about people. The problem is that these superficial qualities can mislead us as if they are all part of a large smokescreen used to cover up the truth that dances before our eyes. I&#039;ve learned this lesson both while observing from a safe distance and while being severely embarrassed by the discovery.<br />
<br />
<div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;">Psychic Reception is different from Empathy, vastly. The main difference is that Psychic reception has a much shorter range</div>This makes me uncertain as to whether or not we are on the same page, Akio: I have never heard of psychic reception being limited to any kind of distance/radius before. Could you perhaps be referring to some other kind of pschyic reception? When I think of psychic reception, I think of clairvoyance, clairaudience, psychic intuition, and psychic feeling. These are the four psychic senses listed and described in Pete A. Sanders&#039; book &quot;You Are Psychic!&quot; <br />
<br />
I am convinced that I have had at least one involuntary experience with each of these psychic senses. I consider them all to be unique conduits for information and stimuli through which our actions can be guided. <br />
<br />
Please give me your thoughts on this and tell me if you believe/know that these forms of psychic reception are also limited by distance. If so, I would be interested to read an example or two if you have any.    <br />

		<div id="post_8260" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">When I looked At Psychic Reception as a whole, I found that it is basically like you using a radio signal to track Brainwaves as a Whole, Of course you can &quot;tune in&quot; on certain people, but the signal still decreases over distance.

It&#039;s a &quot;wireless&quot; psychic reception, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Empathy, however, would be more like a Lan line, It uses links between people in order to get information about them, these are not, if used effectively, affected by distance. Of course, f you aren&#039;t shielded, much like a wire or cable, It is susceptible to Psychic interference or, if your dealing with cables as a whole, crosstalk.

I will try to explain this better at a later time if you&#039;d like, I&#039;ve got to cut it short cause I got to get up early tomorrow (it&#039;s 11:00 pm right now), I felt I should give you something to work with here, but I don&#039;t feel that I explained it very well.<br />
<br />
As for experience, I Study a lot about the paranormal, symbolism, and the like, I figure it this way. If the concept/math doesn&#039;t fit the experience, it&#039;s not the experience that&#039;s wrong; it&#039;s the concept/math. This is a rule that I have found.

I apologize if I reapeated anything, I think I&#039;m missing a few of these things also, but it&#039;s all very interesting info, sometimes you may be able to piece together what I was researching based off of these links.
