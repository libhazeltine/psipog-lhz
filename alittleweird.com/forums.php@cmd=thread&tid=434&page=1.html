		<div id="post_9577" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So I saw this youtube video over meditation and metamorphosis. I didn&#039;t really take it seriously, until I was bored at work and I gave it a shot. The video showed a man enlarging his hand simply by focusing his chi into his hand. Again, I was bored, and I tried it, using tactile visualization. I checked my hands by lining up all the lines on my palms, and my right hand was about a quarter inch longer. I was confused as hell, so I gave it another shot. I tried it with my left hand, and then my left hand was about a quarter inch longer. I&#039;ve practiced many different techniques and skills talked about in this website and on PsiPog, but this is the first one I&#039;ve seen quite visible results with. I&#039;ve done this particular exercise (which only takes about 10 seconds to do), and it&#039;s worked every single time. Any thoughts? Is this happening or am I tricking my self?</div>

I usually keep both hands relaxed, sometimes I tense both of them equally or I raise both hands, but it always seems to work out. At first I thought I was stretching my fingers more, but I made sure I wasn&#039;t, and I even relaxed the enlarged hand and stretched the normal hand, and it STILL worked out. I&#039;ve done this in every possible way to make it so the hand I&#039;m trying to make longer stays the same size, but it just ALWAYS seems to work. It feels strange to look for a failure in something so bizarre but not being able to find it.</div>

		<div id="post_9661" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Blood carries energy... if you can manipulate blood flow so that the energy in your body is controlled, guess what, you&#039;re still manipulating energy.<br />
<br />
The brain is a computer, and computers manipulate energy in order to compute. We manipulate energy flowing in our nervous system.<br />
<br />
To bring these two together, we have muscles in our body that can expand our veins and allow us to radiate heat, muscles are controlled my the nervous system, therefore, we can manipulate where heat is radiating off of our bodies. <br />
<br />
The manipulation of blood in these ways however, is considered by Psions as Biofeedback. I can create cold and hot psi-balls through energy manipulation. If anyone who doesn&#039;t believe in the ability to manipulate energy, I want them to explain how I can make a cold Psi-ball.<br />
<br />
I think it may have something to do with the nervous system... something I have yet to figure out, but something I am studying as of late.<br />
<br />
I find that most psions tend to use a mixture of blood manipulation along with other techniques in order to reach their desired effect. People are so close-minded about these things it&#039;s sickening. They think that because they can&#039;t explain it it doesn&#039;t exist, and it really does piss me off after a while.<br />
<br />
Okay, I&#039;m getting a little carried away, my point is that there is not really any hard evidence out there that says that this does not exist. All there really is is speculation. I think that it&#039;s ignorant to assume that it is psi (an energy that is not confirmed) that causes these things. I think it actually may have relation to black holes in what we&#039;re studying, but I also think it&#039;s ignorant to assume that biofeedback is the answer to why psi-balls don&#039;t exist because People have had the effect happen without biofeedback occurring, and the fact hat biofeedback is a documented problem for psions to overcome.<br />

Well, the meditation &quot;worked&quot; for me.  My hand grew nearly half an inch, I bet.<br />

Now... is it the mediation, or the fact that my hand was raised?  I&#039;m not sure.  I&#039;ll have to test it out...<br />

~Sean</div>I did the meditation again, with my &quot;target&quot; hand on the bottom (instead of raised), and my other hand raised.  I got the same results - my target hand grew about a half inch.  So, based on my two attempts, it seems the meditation is actually causing the growth.  Not the fact that the one hand is raised, or the other.<br />

I wonder.....is one hand getting bigger or the other smaller? or both? O_o</div>Probably both huh?  If it has to do with blood flow like the others said, maybe ur reducing blood flow in one hand and increasing it in another.<br />
The body does change like that right?<br />
I mean, we are about a centimeter shorter at the end of the day from standing and putting pressure on our cartilage, so those rapid body changes might make sense.<br />

I tried it, I didn&#039;t wait for the dude to finish meditating even and it still worked.</div>
