		<div id="post_10758" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi everyone,<br />
recently I came across Crop Circles while talking to my Mom. Some have appeared in Germany. After some reading I even found that some Crop &quot;circles&quot; were supposed to be replies to the SETI message. There are crops circles that are gigantic. The one on Milk Hill (google) consists of 409 circles and ist in a perfect mathematical shape. (Those of you into maths will recognise it). The crop is not broken or trampled down but just bent in circular motions. The stems even have natural bends in them at the base and keep on growing. I really dont know what to think about this. Just typing crop circle into google image search gives the most amazing structures which are nowadays created by complex formula on a computer. Obviously there are some people which try to reproduce or make their own crop circles but these are usually not as perfect and the crop is trampled or rolled flat. <br />
<br />
Has anyone got an idea about this? Here is a link to the SETI reply:<br />
 <a href="http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/articles/arecibo.html" target="_blank">http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/articles/arecibo.html</a><br />
(I think that this is manmade, at least it is possible. A binary code is not to hard to make. just need one big piece of wood. But you never know)<br />
And here is another coded message in a crop field:<br />
 <a href="http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/articles/alienface.html" target="_blank">http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/articles/alienface.html</a><br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry to say that I have not yet read the above links as I have just found them when looking for an english website about crop circles. (The first website which I was reading was in German). <br />
<br />
So... thoughts?</div>

But the question I have is, why is there alphabet the same as ours? Spelling out words in english in binary? Seems kind of strange to me. Unless you ascribe that the aliens have been observing us for quite some time and know our language, or perhaps they are somehow behind the formation of our english alphabet.<br />
<br />
Interesting side note what if the creators of the site are hoaxers and just propogate the myth of alien crop circle being significant or proof of life out there? I&#039;m assuming that the website is operated by people who live in the UK, and that&#039;s where all there crop circle coverage, or at least the majority of it seems to be centered. So, they go out and build these crop circles, then report on them hah. Clever!</div>

If alien intelligence then its quite a weird media to use.. crop. hmm... maybe its the easiest to manipulate for them. But using binary on a crop field? to encode english? why not chinese? and why not just clear type it into the field, why bother binary coding it. <br />
Oh man, so many questions, so little prospect of finding answers.</div>
