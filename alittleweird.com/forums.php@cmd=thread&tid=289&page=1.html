One of the first things to do is to recognize when you&#039;re being drained, and that begins with tuning in to your physical reactions. Is there a tightening in your chest when a certain person enters the conversation? Do you feel tired when you hang up the phone after speaking with someone?

<br />
Think about what you are portraying when you post this article here.  You are showing a mass media, drama queen who is incredibly fluff with her false caring and emotions, who feeds off of popularity and her carving for money, being interested in something extremely serious as psionics.  We psions suffer from a lack of serious study and attention without the distracts of greed of money and fame.  We have enough problems trying to get mere science to take a second, questioning look at us, that we can&#039;t even dream of getting the public to do the same.  For her to even look into our research, and obviously she stole this from some fluff ridden site without really understanding what she and or the author is writing about, only makes our subject a bigger laughing matter.<br />
<br />
Maybe why the stranger things in life get ignored, dismissed, or worse, laughed at, is because of people like you posting this like it&#039;s a serious thing.  This is not the attention I want.  Psi vampires as we all know, are a serious, real subject to study and understand.  They are a real, dangerous threat, but not one to go on panic mode about.  Oprah talking about this, not only makes the whole thing seem silly and easy to ignore, but something that will cause fluff bunnies to run around in circles panicking and &quot;seeing&quot; psi vampires all the time. Surely with all your newbie dealing, know how much a pain in the butt it is to deal with panicking newbies?</div>

The public could give two shits about what &quot;science&quot; thinks.  Talk to people in public about psionics.  Most people are pretty open minded and will share ideas, as long as you communicate on their level.  Don&#039;t buy into the cynics argument that we are the weird ones.  Out of the hundreds of people I&#039;ve talked to in real life about the paranormal, I&#039;ve only met two cynics, and both of them were laughed at when they stated their beliefs out loud.<br />

I found this interesting and began to wonder why this would be and the only explanation is that i am sapping his psi somehow.  Needless to say i have stopped hanging around him while he practices just incase it stops him from doing it.  <br />

No there is no drop in his success.<br />
i wonder if this is something im doing or something he&#039;s doing.  Would i gain more if i was around someone with even more experience with psi or is it just that he is allowing others to use his?  im also wondering maybe because we are brothers that might have something to do with it , as i havent meet a psion in person i cant say. either way its something to think about.<br />
However i can consciously interfere with his, if i concentrate on taking it then there is a drop.  mind you i only tried this once, as an experiment with his permission.</div>

“Would i gain more if i was around someone with even more experience with psi or is it just that he is allowing others to use his?” - funkydeath<br />
<br />
Currently, I can only think of three possible causes that could explain this and, for all I know, more than one of the following possible causes could be present at the same time:<br />
<br />
1. He leaks massive amounts of energy that you are subconsciously tapping into (not so much like a psi vampire, however).<br />
<br />
2. His presence induces a semi-conscious desire in you to do better than usual. This desire, however hidden it may be, could compel your subconscious to help you achieve this goal. <br />
<br />
3. His very physical presence induces a connective strengthening in your abilities in the way that sharing body heat with another can increase the overall body heat for both bodies.<br />
<br />
The latter was expressed (not in the way that I presented it) by an author in terms of psychic cognition and competence. He more or less said that being with just one other person when using psychic abilities will square both persons abilities and will be squared again when another person is added and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
It did not involve psionic abilities, but it is definitely something to consider. It sounds more like a universal principle than something directed at only a select few applications. <br />
<br />
“However i can consciously interfere with his, if i concentrate on taking it then there is a drop.” <br />
<br />
- funkydeath<br />
<br />
That sounds harmless enough. It seems like nothing to worry about from the sounds of it.<br />

“They are a real, dangerous threat, but not one to go on panic mode about.” - JK<br />
<br />
Are you implying that most psi vampires are draining energy out of malevolence?<br />
<br />
If you are, then I am afraid that I am going to have to disagree with you. According to what I have read, psi vampires drain energy because they have to do so to survive. I even heard that they can end up in a hospital if they neglect to feed enough (this supposedly happened to an actual psi vampire). Psi vampires are said to have a strong need to feed due to chakra deficiencies/dysfunctions that they were born with and cannot help.<br />
<br />
I have never heard of psi vampires seriously injuring anyone before either (not that you said this directly, but that is the impression that I am getting from you). They just need to feed once in a while to allow themselves to recharge and function in society. I am not dismissing the possibility, however, that at least some psi vampires take their feeding too far or do so sadistically. That is just a fact of life. There are going to be rotten apples no matter what, but this is no reason to consider them all to be a serious threat.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that we should be fearing them so much. We, as a community, should be trying to understand them and should probably try reaching out to them to help them and those harmed by them with their problem.  <br />
<br />
JK, if I have misinterpreted your statement then I apologize in advance.</div>
