<br />
Since 1 or 2 months I have a lot of nightmares, well i think you can call it nightmare when werewolves are hunting you, giant insectes are attacking your house and you are stalked by demons. The special thing with this nightmares is: I don&#039;t fear them, its more like they start to fear me.<br />
<br />
The werewolves, were not hunting me, but a girl who was running to my flat and beating on the door. I let her in and shut the door. The upper half of the door was glas so I could look outside and waited for something to happen. then 3 werewolves can running and jumped at the door. All i did was watching them until they ran away.<br />
The giant insects were beaten up by me through usage of a flamethrower and,...I guess it was a rockt launcher or a laser gun, can&#039;t remember correctly.<br />
The demon (This nightmare I guess was caused by wathcing The Exorcism of Emily Rose) lurked around my home and some slightly strange things happened, like the door to my room wouldn&#039;t shut, some time later I caught that bastard and tied him up with silver wire (watched Underworld the day before, so I thought he had a Silver-weakness).<br />
<br />
Has something like that ever happened to you, that you were not afraid of your nightmares?<br />
Before someone askes, I haven&#039;t been lucid in any of them. If I was then believe me the nightmares would have been over easier</div>

It was then that I started to practice waking up just before the scariest moment. It has given me the ability to wake up when I have to without using an alarm clock (of course, if I&#039;m not too exhausted). I have not been able to have any lucid dreams though.</div>

Then every so often I would die fighting some monster in some sort of descriptive location (ex. dark pit with waist height of blood and human body parts floating around). It has gotten to the point that I am not scared of the dreams because I fully expect that I am going to die some time in the dream. Also I am desensitized by all the violence in such dreams so the worst feeling I get is that the dream is weird.<br />
<br />
I used to play computer games a lot, but now I am almost going cold turkey because they have not allowed me to bring up my PC (I am currently using a MacBook, which is great except I can&#039;t play that many computer games). I rarely watch scary/horror movies.<br />
<br />
BTW the dying for someone else dream has been reoccurring (even though the characters change) for eight years. Usually it ends with me dying in a hospital bed with the person I saved looking down at me. However there are a few instances where that happens, but I don&#039;t die and I recover from my wounds (usually gunshot wounds).<br />
