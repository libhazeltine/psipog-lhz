		<div id="post_11123" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi, new to the forums but read alot at psipog and other sites about psi. I have a question about psi tendrils if anyone has any experience with them that is not in the area of them sucking energy out of things. Have looked on alot of forums and blogs and websites however mostly I have seen them related to psi vampires. Maybe this is the wrong term for it or area but I remember on psipog a vague reference to moving something with the swat of a tendril.It may have been a quote from Rainsong. I was just wondering if anyone had any experience of a tendril like thing popping up out of nowhere moving stuff when they were using psi wheel or moving pencils after a couple of hours in a session. Any input greatly appreciated thanks</div>

I haven&#039;t moved anything with it before but it is useful for gathering and sending out information. I personally use it for short to mid range draining (when draining in large amounts only, for smaller amounts I use a different method), but it can be used to create contact with objects and send/receive info from them.<br />

I&#039;m sure if you set it up properly you could use it for making something move, but I&#039;ve never tried it...</div>

You can use them for all sorts of stuff, from low-level scanning to using it to ping someone. So I guess if you decided to make a psi tendril you wanted to move something and made it with enough energy and were pretty good at PK... then I guess that would work. =)</div>

It seemed to look like white steam but did not act like steam. The corners of the psi wheel would go faster the closer the steam like thing got to it. It did not seem to have a source it just kind of hung in mid air and was small and tentacle like. Yeah I thought there was an article at psipog where Rainsong or one of the others mentioned this..it may have been in a forum???

During one of the times it was spinning good I noticed something near the corner of the psi wheel (steam thing which was stationary). It looked like a little octopus tentacle made of steam. And it seemed to slap the corners as the went by, hense the speeding up of the wheel when the corners got near it. I saw around it and under it and it seemed to be like a disembodied tentacle just floating there not connected to anything. Very odd.As far as I know I used no technique to create that just the regular one to move the psi wheel around????</div>

It was like the shape of a tomato or bean plant when it pokes through the ground( naw it was more like the front end of a worm when its moving on top of ground trying to decide which way to go and it stretches itself a little).It seemed clearly defined solid steam not globular, you knew where the sides were for it was easy to distinguish from the background.

a)static like spots when you get up quickly<br />
b)wavy background that looks like its moving when you&#039;ve strained eyes<br />
c)blob spots different colors when rubbing eyes or staring at sun<br />
d)heat causing air to give mirage affect on ground<br />
e)miscellaneous junk floating on eye lens<br />
f)doing drugs various visual affects<br />
                   <br />
And I was not outdoors on any medication or on drugs staring at the sun rubbbing my eyes getting up quickly near a heat source looking at stuff on eyes by straining them. So the probability of hallucination seems low. <br />
I think I&#039;ll call it a &quot;psi worm&quot; since the tendril term seems more related to sucking and sensing psi although &quot;psi tentacle&quot; seems more apt . This seems more like an odd manifestation of psi energy in semi physical form shaped by some unconscious means. Yeah weird energy is probably what it was       </div>

Because you expected it to. Just energy being there wont do it. If you send a psiball through a psiwheel for example, it will have no effect unless you intend or program it to. So you could be subconciously making the wheel go faster, when it hits the energy. <br />
<br />
Or you could just be imagining it going faster. For example:<br />
<br />
Guy 1: I can make the brown in my eye go a little brighter, wanna see?<br />
Guy 2: Sure<br />
Guy 2: OMG it actually is! <br />
<br />
<br />
It didnt really go brighter, but the guy thought it did because he was paying specific attention.  I&#039;m not saying what you said isnt true, it definitely can be. I&#039;m just saying some other explanations. You really dont need to listen to any of this though. :P</div>

<br />
It&#039;s definitely possible you&#039;ve encountered something like a psi-tendril. It may be yours, but not consciously it seems.<br />
<br />
Mentalism is a good explanation for why you saw the Tendril however because it follows key principles that we use in psi today.<br />
<br />
If you want it to happen, and you want it bad enough, it will happen. It may just be that the Tendril is either your subconscious moving the wheel or the manifestation caused by you in order to give you the push to move the wheel.<br />
<br />
Plenty of other explanations, so idk. Anyway, good luck to you Faust ^_^</div>

It&#039;s definitely possible you&#039;ve encountered something like a psi-tendril. It may be yours, but not consciously it seems.

Mentalism is a good explanation for why you saw the Tendril however because it follows key principles that we use in psi today.

If you want it to happen, and you want it bad enough, it will happen. It may just be that the Tendril is either your subconscious moving the wheel or the manifestation caused by you in order to give you the push to move the wheel.
