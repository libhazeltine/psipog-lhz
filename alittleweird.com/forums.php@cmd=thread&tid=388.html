For example lets say for sake of argument that the roswell landing actually did happen or the alien autopsy, so what? it would prove that there are aliens out there, why is that worth keeping a secret? the alien in the autopsy was dead so its not like it gave &#039;them&#039; any info, and it happened so long ago that if it did it hasn&#039;t made a huge difference to the world.  i dont know im probably just ranting here, but i dont see what the problem would be, sure some may panic with the knowledge that we are not alone in this vast space we call the universe but others would rejoice , and its not like having the knowledge would really effect day to day goings on.  maybe a public holiday on the day the landings happened.

<br />
I don&#039;t necessarily believe anything happened at roswell; or that we&#039;re in contact with aliens. The only reason I could perceive for keeping things quite is that maybe if it came into the public eye it would not be considered &#039;acceptable&#039;, or would possibly shift the &quot;power&quot; of things into an unfavorable position for those in power. Or possibly it makes them more powerful?<br />
<br />
Perhaps it&#039;s something that they are trying to gain new technology from researching and exposing it to the public might mean some international &quot;defense&quot; crisis or some crap like that.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was a russian craft that crashed and we didn&#039;t want to admit to anyone during the cold war that russia was capable of getting into the middle of the U.S. without our detection?<br />
<br />
<br />
Or Maybe, Just maybe... Well, who knows.</div>

Their technology could be extremely advanced and releasing it would have a major effect on the people. Every action has a reaction kind of stuff.<br />

		<div id="post_8575" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I think a realistic answer is what Sheep said about national defense.  If the gov&#039;t has a secret, then it&#039;s very easy to keep secret.  But if something is made public, then the entire world knows.  So, if (for example) the gov&#039;t had just some junk from a crash site, it&#039;s much better to keep that secret and research it secretly, than to let the cat out of the bag.  Because once it&#039;s out - it&#039;s out.  I don&#039;t think it has to do with any sort of &quot;public panic&quot;, or any of that.  If the secrets exist, it&#039;s for practical purposes - like, not letting Russia or China get technological secrets.<br />

lets assume that aliens exist, free energy is possible, and the US government is in possession of such technology, and in contact with the aliens. in this scenario, the us government would have more power because more access to advanced technology when trading with the aliens, and would gain more money by selling the less advanced (but still more advanced then our current tech) to other people. also, consider they obtained free energy from the aliens, the oil industry is a MASSIVE buisness that pulls in countless millions per year, just to provide energy to the masses, and fuel for their cars, and their motorsports, and their heaters, etc. thats a huge buisness, and if free energy were released to the masses, that would break down the whole oil industry, because we wouldnt need it anymore.<br />
anyway, on roswell, THAT alien might be dead, but there might be others aswell.<br />
<br />
its fear aswell. we&#039;re taught so many things about the world, and for those who have a view about the world, similar to the geocentric ideas of the middle ages, say, admitting aliens exist, or even that psionics exists would be like ripping a giant hole in their reality, thus creating fear and panic.</div>
