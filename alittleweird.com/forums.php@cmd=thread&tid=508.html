I found this site by way of psipog, and Ive really learned a lot from psipog. its got a lot more stuff to learn from. To tell the truth, I really like its setup a lot better than this site, other than the fact that it needs a forum like this one, but I really liked how it was learning oriented, instead of doing oriented. People like me who are new to this stuff want more than an archive to look back to, we want to learn with other people and use the media area to show our progress and such.

Maybe if enough people like the idea, we can convince Mr. Connelly to do that for us :)</div>

		<div id="post_10702" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I agree that psipog had a huge community. but the main problem is only the smallest portion was actually dedicated to psionics. You can see that with this community and with how few people from psipog remain. There was a small group of us that really dedicated to training , i&#039;ll say i wasn&#039;t the most active or productive but i was in the irc room evvery day for 5 months discussing and gaining insight.<br />
About 90% of psipog members were vaguely interested in psionics thought it was cool and interesting, tried it once and forgot about it. Another 7% stuck around but didnt take it seriously giving psipog a childish immaturity. 2% were people like me who practiced seriously but didnt cotribute a huge amount. and 1% were people like sheepking joeT , erik durwood, etc who were deeply involved and contributed much.<br />
In short psipog lost its purpose and became diluted.<br />

I wont make assumptions but i thinkthis is close to the reason why sean decided to close shop. i think i read it on his blog when he closed it.</div>

In short psipog lost its purpose and became diluted.</div>That is part of the reason.  Or at least, part of the reason why I don&#039;t feel bad for closing PsiPog.  I wrote about this idea here:  <a href="2007/11/14/i-dont-miss-psipog/index.html" target="_blank">http://alittleweird.com/2007/11/14/i-dont-miss-psipog/</a><br />
<br />
The main reason I closed PsiPog was because it was rooted in disbelief.  But even those reasons I don&#039;t fully agree with now.  Basically: we all grow and change.  I started PsiPog when I was 17 years old, 8 years ago.  PsiPog feels like de-evolution to me, at this point.  It&#039;s moving backwards.<br />
<br />
So, I will definitely NOT be re-opening PsiPog.  I think metalforever has done a great job at PsionicsOnline, and her community seems to capture the essence of PsiPog (and improved on it!).  If you want that sort of psionic community, then hang out over there.<br />
<br />
I think the community here is cool.  It&#039;s big enough so we have some cool ideas floating around, but not so big that I have to have a team of people moderate everything.<br />
<br />
I am at another cross-road in my mind concerning the best way forward with psionics.  I mentioned some of my current thoughts in this thread:  <a href="forums.php@cmd=thread&amp;tid=501.html" target="_blank">http://alittleweird.com/forums.php?cmd=thread&amp;tid=501</a> .  Once I finish pounding out the ideas, I may change ALW around a bit.  The Blog format is getting on my nerves a little :-).<br />

We were loitering on the channel, and the bot was programmer to ban everyone on its &quot;black&quot; list. <br />
<br />
For some reason, Sean was kicked out of the channel accompanied by bots message: &quot;Sean was banned by PsipogBot&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
He came back shortly after, but the whole situation was a bit comic. <br />
<br />
It was the golden days of Psicism, or Psionic Fascism as history knows it.<br />
You had to login to enter the channel, and saying words such as : &quot;ur&quot; + &quot;u&quot; + &quot;dbz&quot; and &quot;r&quot; resulted in a swift automated kick from the channel. Magic, Chi, Ghosts, Spirits, Spells, Charms, Gods, Religions and such were banned. And violators were dealt harshly.<br />
<br />
Newcomers were sometimes duped with questions such as : &quot;What letter comes after t in the alphabets?&quot;. Naturally they would say: &quot;u&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, And Sean was quite a Peebrain back then.</div>
