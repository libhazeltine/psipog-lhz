		<div id="post_14753" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I have a personal theory that, as we are extensions of the universe [by being conscious parts of it], our wills mean something. Think about it; we&#039;re just a collection of atoms that isn&#039;t really that different from any other collection of atoms, except for the fact that our entropy is very, very low compared to our environment... but we&#039;re conscious nonetheless. Anyway, my thoughts are that willpower has something to do with the collapse of quantum mechanical wavefunctions [although I don&#039;t have any good ideas about how to connect this to decoherence yet]. If this is true it could explain magick, which would simply be collapsing wavefunctions from probabilities/superposition into a definite manifestation, one which isn&#039;t very likely and hence it seems like we&#039;re acting at a distance to manifest a reality which also isn&#039;t very likely [such as, I dunno, setting things in motion such that it ends up with you getting money from someone].<br />
<br />
I know magick and accounts of it are muddied by hindsight bias and the extreme subjective nature of it, but I think I&#039;m onto something here.<br />

The universe isn&#039;t local, and I think that points to a very deep unity that people unwittingly exploit.</div>
