But what thing lingers in the concept of this thread. &#039;Free energy&#039; would imply that you don&#039;t need any outside source to work the thing, but this machine still needs a little jump start. I&#039;m sure that this is taught at universities all over the world, but inertia applies to things like this as well. You still need a battery to start it, but it will continue to go after the initial input. Despite this, I am still really excited about this generator!</div>

		<div id="post_7842" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I have seen over unity devices in action before; some using the rotational resonance apparatus (Sundance engine) that John Christie&#039;s Lutec 1000 employs.<br />
<br />
Understand, the concepts that these devices operate under at not really far fetched at all if you really understand your physics and have just enough of an open mind.  The challenge with designing an over-unity device is not a matter of some mystical arcane secret; it&#039;s all about precision and efficiency.<br />
<br />
Understand, the Lutec 1000 is just a DC motor built into an AC generator.  The DC motor pulses energy into the rotor and its weight continues its revolution. During this rotation permanent magnets pass coils that induct the energy as electrical energy and some can be re-used to power the DC motor and the rest is usable power.  A battery system or other external power source is there to keep the system running if it looses efficiency.<br />
<br />
Sounds simple enough, but it defies a bit of standard logic that we all have learned about physics:  You can&#039;t get more than what you put in.<br />
<br />
Ah but that&#039;s where the skill comes in.<br />
<br />
The permanent magnets are energy.  Stored potential energy ready for work.  When the engine is &quot;kick-started&quot; that &quot;energy investment&quot; causes the first pass to generate power from the magnets.  Fine.  But the rotor is so heavy, the energy you got from the coil is not as substantial as the investment that got it turning.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has built a Tesla Coil could tell you, resonating frequency is key.  The amount of wire you have, the pulsing of the power needs to be just enough to &quot;fill&quot; the coil before the polarity flips and loads the other direction.  The physical properties of the wire and the dimensioning of the coil will change the resonating frequency of the device and only when you tune it to the proper adjustments, you can broadcast electrical energy wirelessly and have a truly efficient machine.<br />
<br />
Think about it; with a generator like this, when it gets spinning fast enough, there is enough inertia in the rotor, it will spin for a few more revolutions if power is cut from it.  Moreover at that speed, the amount of energy needed to KEEP the rotor spinning is actually much less than what was needed to start it.  With strong enough magnets, (that DON&#039;T change in strength regardless of how fast the generator is spinning) they will actually generate MORE power than the DC motor needs to keep the rotor spinning.<br />
<br />
Simply put, the device converts inertia and magnetism (naturally occurring stored energies) into electrical energy using investment energy to start the process.<br />
<br />
The better the pulse timing, the less energy is needed to keep it rotating, less energy is wasted and higher efficiency is attained.<br />
<br />
So what is to controversial about it?  Well, we don&#039;t have a unified framework to connect gravity and electromagnetism yet.  That there is a fundamental energy framework that is beyond the physical and connects all energy and to date, we have not decided on what that is yet.<br />
<br />
To accept the concepts that this claims to function under is to agree on concepts of physics not currently agreed upon.  A scary proposition for those worried about their credibility.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  I&#039;m looking forward to the next batch of engines.  Understand, it&#039;s no longer a matter of &quot;does this work&quot;  but &quot;how well does this work.&quot;  It&#039;s a race for efficiency.<br />
<br />
For those skeptical of the process, I encourage you to learn college level physics, do some research and keep a modestly open mind.<br />
