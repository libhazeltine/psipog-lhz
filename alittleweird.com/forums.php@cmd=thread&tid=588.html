I read a book about demons and generation curses. it was very interesting. when i get the book back i will share the name and auther. Just in case anyone is wondering already about generational curses. In the bible it says that if you go against My word you and your children and there children for four generations will be cursed. i cant remember it exactly but that is close. it deals with freemasonry and other cults. ya so ill try to get the title.

... i turned back and saw a seven foot tall (about that.)  person in a dark robe type thing with a hood without a face...</div>Hello Faceless. I have been a member of these forums for awhile now but I rarely post anything. This time I had to chime in though. I believe you have encountered a &quot;Shadow Person&quot;. I have been dealing with these beings for a few years now. My cousin and myself have experience with them in very many different kinds of situations, including but not limited to combat... <br />
<br />
The general &#039;paranormal&#039; thoughts on these beings are pretty much split -- Some believe they are in fact demons. Some think that they are inter-dimensional beings that are here for observational purposes. Others think they are just lost spirits. Whatever you choose to believe I feel like I need to urge you to always be on guard. I have reason to believe that, as you have already stated, they are a dark energy. They are powerful and terrifying. Be careful friend. As far as I&#039;ve seen, once you start seeing them -- you will have to deal with them for a long time. Years in my case. <br />
<br />
If you need to talk to me more about this I am willing to share what I believe. I&#039;ll check back here, but you can also contact me at <a href="mailto:raynman84@sbcglobal.net">raynman84@sbcglobal.net</a><br />
<br />
For some information use wikipedia, there is a large write up on these &quot;Shadow People&quot; but you never really know what you will get with internet searches. <br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

Whatever you choose to believe I feel like I need to urge you to always be on guard. I have reason to believe that, as you have already stated, they are a dark energy. They are powerful and terrifying. Be careful friend. As far as I&#039;ve seen, once you start seeing them -- you will have to deal with them for a long time. Years in my case. 

If you need to talk to me more about this I am willing to share what I believe. I&#039;ll check back here, but you can also contact me at raynman84@sbcglobal.net

For some information use wikipedia, there is a large write up on these &quot;Shadow People&quot; but you never really know what you will get with internet searches. 

Good luck

I have been a member of these forums for awhile now but I rarely post anything. This time I had to chime in though. I believe you have encountered a &quot;Shadow Person&quot;.

The general &#039;paranormal&#039; thoughts on these beings are pretty much split -- Some believe they are in fact demons.

How did you first encounter &quot;shadow people&quot;?</div>Corpse,<br />
It was a few years ago, maybe four or five. I began seeing these &#039;people&#039; around my house. I would wake up at strange hours of the night to see them standing over me just watching me... Those were the first few encounters. Over the years they have followed me to a different house, and to my job and even different states. I have also been physically affected by these beings. A single touch feels similar to a sever &quot;dead arm&quot; not much fun at all. <br />

I may not have explained myself very well... I believe that these &#039;shadows&#039; can appear  as real and tangible as me and you, and / or as standing three dimensional shadows. I have seen both versions of these guys and I am fairly sure they are the same thing. That&#039;s not to say that is exactly what you have encountered. But by your description I&#039;d bet on it.  <br />
