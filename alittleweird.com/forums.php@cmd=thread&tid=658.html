		<div id="post_12644" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I don&#039;t believe it. It talks about things like expression and scars and wrinkles. How can gut feelings come from that? It makes it sound like all humans express things openly. No. Wrong. If you see someone smiling, does that make you like them? Does it make them a good person? Does it really mean they&#039;re happy? If someone has a scar, does that make them bad? Or does it make them seem vulnerable, easier to like because something about them screams &quot;I&#039;ve had a hard life&quot;? <br />
<br />
A person&#039;s expression ultimately tells you nothing about them. It might give you a FEELING from the person, like wow they look nice or something. But not a PERCEPTION of the person, and THAT is a gut feeling. You won&#039;t look at someone laughing and smiling with their friends that you&#039;ve never met before and the first thought that pops into your head is &quot;wow, she is a bitch&quot;-that is perception. Find a better word if you like. That is a gut feeling. Going by expression alone is misleading.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m just rambling. Okay simplify my babbling.<br />
<br />
Expression=surface deep<br />
Gut feeling=beneath the surface<br />
<br />
&quot;Â­Providing more immediate information are the changes in a person&#039;s face, such as smiles, frowns or scowls. These changes provide us with the most obvious information about someone&#039;s mood or immediate intentions. Expressions represent the person&#039;s intended message, the one he or she is trying to convey. A person trying to gain your trust will smile. Someone trying to scare you will scowl.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is obviously written by someone who takes what they see at face-value, instead of trying to look beneath the surface or trying to think outside the box. <br />
<br />
Here are a few basic reasons why this is false. <br />
<br />
1) Author is assuming that people are aware of their facial expressions all the time. <br />
<br />
-Wrong. I&#039;ve lost count of the amount of times that people have said to me &quot;You look mad. What&#039;s wrong?&quot;, when I&#039;m not mad at all. It always catches me off-guard. People are not always aware of what their face is doing. They may subconciously be scowling, grinning, frowning; anything. This could mean that they&#039;re dwelling on some internal thought that has nothing to do with what&#039;s going on around them, or just a completely misplaced expression; the possibilities are endless. You get the gist of it. Which brings me to number two.<br />
<br />
2) Author is assuming that the facial expression is a precise representation of what said person is thinking.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this is not true. For one, the person&#039;s facial expression-as previously stated-may be more directed to an internal thought, or they are unaware of what their face is doing. It may also be a front. If you&#039;re one of those warm-hearted people who try to avoid hurting feelings, think of this: It&#039;s Christmas. Your aunt just bought you the most dreadful looking sweater you&#039;ve ever laid eyes on. You control your expression so it doesn&#039;t reflect the horror and revulsion you feel. She is sitting across from you looking at you expectantly. You hitch up a smile and give a pleased exlamation at your gift-but inside you&#039;re screaming &quot;GOD THIS IS HIDEOUS!&quot;. <br />
<br />
...I don&#039;t really think I need to bore you guys any more. You probably get it.</div>

And I don&#039;t mean literally psychic or anything. So people could be like that and not know it. You&#039;d have to do extensive testing of each subject. Way too much work. 

Besides, the whole concept of microexpressions is bogus. I could say why, but I did that in my first post so..</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

They mentioned briefly about a horse named Clever Hans who was trained to do various mathmatical calculations. It turned out that the horse was merely responding to the trainer&#039;s involuntary body/facial cues. The cues were so subtle, yet Clever Hans was able to detect them. Reading this article about microexpressions makes me wonder how distant we are from our primitive selves. If animals can be that in tune with their natural instincts of reading the smallest expressions, then couldn&#039;t a human also be?  </div>

How do animals communicate with each other?<br />
I&#039;ve often asked myself that question.<br />
Sure certain sounds they make may mean certain things. But I think it goes beyond that. I actually believe that they can communicate with telepathy. Maybe basic things like sending pictures. Maybe more advanced then we can do. And why not?<br />

So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s ALL expression reading.<br />

You also said, &quot;Author is assuming that the facial expression is a precise representation of what said person is thinking.&quot; What the author really said was &quot;Microexpressions can be much more accurate signs of a person&#039;s true feelings and intentions than the expression he or she is <strong>consciously</strong> producing.&quot;<br />

It would probably be a good idea to read the rest since the first page is only an overview of how we perceive human facial expressions in general. The rest explains what they mean by microexpressions. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really understand why you believe the portion of the article you just quoted is off-based and ignorant. It looks like they were just trying to state a fact; that expressions represent a person&#039;s intended message. Is it not true that when you are trying to be friendly, you smile, or when someone tries to scare you, they generally make a scary face?<br />
 <br />
Some people are very good at hiding what they feel, but most people aren&#039;t. It&#039;s not just facial expressions, there may be an infinite source of physical cues people give off that only the subconscious mind recieves. I actually find it very interesting and refreshing that maybe our gut feelings about people are merely due to something as simple as a smirk.<br />
<br />
Edit- You asked how we can know if the expressions leaking through have anything to do with the situation. We don&#039;t, but we&#039;re egocentric creatures and will assume the expressions leaking through has something to do us and therefore feel certain ways about it. <br />
Expressions are the way in which we can tell someone how we feel without speaking. I don&#039;t believe you can tell the true nature of someone due to their expressions, but the article was saying the gut feelings you get may be due to microexpressions, basically trying to dissect intuition. I think it&#039;s logical.</div>
