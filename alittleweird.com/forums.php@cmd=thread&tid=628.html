<br />
For one, I have my &quot;true thought&quot; and then my &quot;Shell Thought&quot;. The &quot;true thought&quot; layer is just a basis of basic processes, Ideas, and concepts (They are thoughts of thoughts). My &quot;Shell Thought&quot; is my adaptive thinking process, it allows me to convert how I think to nearly anyone else.<br />
<br />
A second thing is, I have fixed a majority of my so called &quot;Problems&quot; via natural methods (which resulted in the above thought pattern).<br />
<br />
And Third, the majority of my left over &quot;problems&quot; that people have noticed about me is because I often am thinking on a different level and about different things, which consumes a good portion of the processing ability I show on a standard day. <br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
ANYWAY, now that I&#039;ve got my rant out, I feel I should get to my point.<br />
<br />
 Many people who are diagnosed with ADD/ADHD just think in a different way than what &quot;the standard population&quot; thinks like. Much as I&#039;ve described above may be the process for some person who may or may not have been diagnosed to have ADD/ADHD, although it is most probably not the only thought process that someone diagnosed with ADD/ADHD has for sure.<br />
<br />
 I am willing to bet that all people who are diagnosed with ADD/ADHD have a difference in thinking pattern than other people. This can arguably called natural evolution and adaptation.<br />
<br />
 Now, by human nature, we tend not to like change. It&#039;s just instinctive to fear the unknown, so why wouldn&#039;t we use drugs to suppress these changes? <br />
<br />
 We fear that because we are different that we are wrong. This is something that makes me want to proverbially slap the human race. I mean, instead of embracing your life, they push away and try to forget about the parts they don&#039;t like, it sickens me...but I guess it can&#039;t be helped ^_^.</div>

I know how you feel, akio, I want to slap the human race, too.<br />
<br />
ADD/ADHD is somewhat just a different way of thinking. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t wait for the day I get diagnosed with ADD &#039;cause my mom would slap the doctor.<br />
<br />
I hate when people single others out for their differences. They are either saying that because of their difference, they are higher or lower that everyone else. I think that&#039;s why I have it when teachers praise me, especially in front of the class. I all I want to do is to be left alone. When teachers praise me, I give them the evil eye. Once, a sub gave me a lollipop for being quiet an doing my work. I threw the lollipop in the trash on the way out the door.<br />

I know how you feel, akio, I want to slap the human race, too.

ADD/ADHD is somewhat just a different way of thinking. 

I can&#039;t wait for the day I get diagnosed with ADD &#039;cause my mom would slap the doctor.

I hate when people single others out for their differences. They are either saying that because of their difference, they are higher or lower that everyone else. I think that&#039;s why I have it when teachers praise me, especially in front of the class. I all I want to do is to be left alone. When teachers praise me, I give them the evil eye. Once, a sub gave me a lollipop for being quiet an doing my work. I threw the lollipop in the trash on the way out the door.
