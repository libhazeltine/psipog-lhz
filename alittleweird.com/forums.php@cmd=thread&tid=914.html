I have met 2 people in the last 3 years, whom I have recognized like I had known them before we even met for the first time. Actually, it felt like they were old forgotten friends of mine. I think at least one of them felt the same for me. We kept meeting by random coincidences, but he always disappears shortly after meeting him again (has problems with drinking and keeps falling out of school). I can&#039;t tell about the other such friend - seemed like a normal guy with no problems.<br />

last year i have met a girl, who was different from all the others to me. but i was curious about her because i felt that shes one of these persons who seems to attract a lot of problems.( she has also alcohol problems, drugs, school failure, problems with ex boyfriends,violence etc...) <br />
but on the other side there is this strong feeling that i need her and she needs me so much.<br />
<br />
Then i ve made a terrible mistake. I sent her away.<br />
As Time was passing by, i recognized my mistake and started to search for her.<br />
<br />
After 6 month i found her. And we were so glad. the interesting thing was, that she told me, she was looking for me aswell in this time.<br />
Like we are bond together.<br />
<br />
And so we found each other one more time. I move now to her city where she lives.<br />
but the closer i come  the stronger this &quot;feeling of Danger&quot; starts to rise up again even more stronger and i really dont know what to do!<br />

I don&#039;t have anything to say for the first two, but for Elexiel, have you thought about it being her &quot;feeling of Danger&quot;? As in, she feels in danger, and you are picking up her feelings. The closer you get to her, the stronger they get. I should start by asking her about it. And even if she doesn&#039;t have a &quot;feeling of danger&quot;, her subconscouse could. I hope this helps or points you in the right direction. Let me know how it goes.<br />
<br />
For you other two, I&#039;ll look into some things and get back to you both. <br />

And that&#039;s valid for everything. If you are love, you attract more love to you; like you work a channel of Gods&#039; love to manifest to physical level, and when giving more love out, you get more yourself. Strange, but it just works like that. The more you are depressed, the more you attract similar people to you. So, according to that, when we are madly in love with our partner, we easily attract human beings which we could easily fall in love (usually it just needs more consciousness, but that&#039;s the way it goes).<br />
<br />
So, it could be your possibility to get further in your path in this incarnation, you just have to start learning from it and start following it. Become love, and everything&#039;s possible :) Well, that&#039;s a pretty hard thing to attain :) It might be your meaning of life, help those people who need you most at the moment.</div>

Yeah, I&#039;ve felt that way too.
