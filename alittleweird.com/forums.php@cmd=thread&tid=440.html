@takkun: a pressure guage would only be usefull in measuring air pressoure, not psi, as psi dosent actually apply a force to anything (unless its told to with pk). unless you were to program a construct to influence the guage with tk, so that the effect is directly proportional to the density of psi in the area, it would be useless. but thats abit complex.</div>

Humans have been known to err a lot in the field of science. &quot;Science&quot; shouldnt be looked at as a foundation but more as a buttress for further study. For all I know psi cant be measured as pressure because it exists in a dimension overlapping ours. We have no way of knowing. But surely, it gives off some form of physical energy if it can travel and move a psiwheel. so....food for thought I guess, Ive just found that here lately, even the Psi community has gotten a little &quot;scientific&quot; for our own good.</div>

		<div id="post_9751" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">That&#039;s my point, all I ever hear is trying to disprove psi, not prove it. Last time I checked, we don&#039;t even understand gravity. So I could go around saying I am the sole source of gravity. Doesn&#039;t make it true, but I&#039;d like to see you disprove it. And we can&#039;t accurately test its existence because we don&#039;t understand the mechanics behind it. Psi IS science, so the method is irrelevant. The problem is we separate the two.

You are limiting yourself and closing off a chance for advancement by believing that anything is absolutely correct.

Instead of allowing society to define what’s normal, it’s time to let reality decide. There is nothing supernatural about the things we experience - if it happens in reality, then it is natural. If society doesn’t like it: tough shit. I’m not here to sugar coat the things I see so the cynics won’t judge me harshly. I’m not here to defend what is ultimately a reflection of reality. I’m not going to try and cram reality into someone else’s belief system. It is our responsibility to change our belief system to fit reality - not the other way around&#039; ~Sean Connelly<br />

It&#039;s hypocritical to say that Psi is the only answer to this experience and be on this site. Granted, I&#039;m not here to Make anyone change their beliefs, just to open their eyes.<br />

Basically what I&#039;m saying is that we should not determine something exists ( and giving something a name is an attempt to determine something exists), and rather we should let our knowledge expand to a greater level than saying that it&#039;s only psi that does this.<br />
<br />
Are you describing Psi as an a force, a derived unit, what? If you don&#039;t know these things, you should not assume that you have any answer unless you have the backing to prove it. The fact of the matter is that Psi has no solid definition, and therefor is at this point to general for me to consider the truth. It tends to be that the most specific answer is also the most correct<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t make any connection to Mysticism... you&#039;re misinterpreting what I&#039;m saying...<br />
<br />
You need to open your eyes to further possibilities other then psi, stop hiding behind the undefined Ideal of an intangible, unveil the curtain, and look at it from more than just one point of view. You&#039;re calling an effect something that has no definition, that is what leads to delusion. Making something more than it is.<br />
<br />
I do not doubt any of my abilities, it&#039;s just that we as a community are limiting ourselves by saying that it&#039;s only one thing that causes any specific effect, even though these affects may have the same base root. <br />
<br />
I may have theories that involve psi, but I also have those that do not involve it. Do yousee my point here?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I am not telling anyone that it might not exist, because it very well might exist. I rather think that YOU SHOULD OPEN YOUR EYES to all possibilities, including those that say that everything that we have devoted our time to is incorrect.<br />

redifine... My point is that you need to keep your mind open to the possibilities out there. Objectively, Psi hasn&#039;t been proven to BE anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Psi (pronounced sigh) is a term commonly used by parapsychologists  to refer to both ESP and psychokinesis  taken together. The term was coined by B.P. Weisner and recommended by R.H. Thouless as a term for describing ESP in his 1942 article &quot;The Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy and Related Phenomena,&quot; (Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 47, part 166, pp. 1-19). J. B Rhine (1948 Reach of the Mind) used the term to refer to both ESP and psychokinesis.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is not a definition, rather, it is considered according to theory that Psi is the mechanic. Meaning that Psi has to be something, but that leaves an open book ready for interpretation. Psi, in effect, could be anything. I could say that psi was anything.<br />
<br />
According to the definition you just gave it it is an unknown mechanic. Something used to make the work of moving an object with your mind easier, or for that matter possible.<br />
<br />
Any theory on here does not necessarily have to be a psi theory, because not all things that fit the definition of Psi. You wouldn&#039;t call magnetism Psi, even though it does achieve the purpose. Looking at this from a broader perspective than just Parapsychology, one has to understand that nothing is certain. That is how knowledge evolves over time, and people who believe solely in anything physical, especially something that is so vague as Psi, tend to lose their credibility.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m trying to make a point here that there may be more than any one effect is causing things to happen. To do something like that is backtracking in knowledge, because you are stating hypothesis as fact, without any experiment, without any real understanding of what may be lying behind the perspectives you have created for yourselves.<br />
<br />
There is much more that needs to be determined, before we can accurately say anything about how these things that we are able to do work. If you want people to catch on to psionics, you have to make yourself as credible as possible.<br />
<br />
My latest theory, still in development, says that energy is made up of more than just positive and negative, it is a code in which we are learning to harness and control little by little. We had the basics of healing and the like down earlier on, because in involved correcting imbalances. Right now we are the theoretical script kiddies of reality, Taking the coding of our body and projecting it out. But soon, we may end up creating effects on the field of space time itself. We only have limits because the codes of our body have limits, to break these limits, one must learn the code.<br />

granted, it&#039;s not tested or proven as of yet. Hell, it&#039;s not even complete, but it&#039;s something to look at. </div>

i understand that we need to be open minded, i&#039;m just pointing out the absurdity of one of your points. mainly &quot;psi is the mechanic behind telepathy and pk, but we have to look to things beyond psi to explain it&quot;. as soon as we bring in something else to explain it, that something else becomes part of the explaination and therefore, part of psi.<br />

to divide it up further, without a master-set (if you like, psi in this case) would be to overcomplicate things and make it confusing. my point is whatever we come up with, we should still put under the &#039;psi&#039; monkier, to make it easier and more understandable (another thing to make us more credible). an example of this is in physics, radioactive decay is made up of a number of different processes, alpha decay, beta decay, and even gamma emission. and they dont always happen together, and they use different processes to achieve different results, but they still all come under the &#039;radioactive decay&#039; title.<br />
