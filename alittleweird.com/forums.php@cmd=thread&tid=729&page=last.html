Mitchell grew up in Roswell, New Mexico, which some UFO believers maintain was the site of a UFO crash in 1947.

But, he claimed, they &quot;didn&#039;t want to go to the grave with their story. They wanted to tell somebody reliable. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story.&quot;</div>~Sean</div>

I e-mailed someone who runs a fairly (understatement) popular blog on the topic of Ufology and she informed me that the only reason this story was run again was because CNN recently attended the X-Conference and the guy just repeated his side of the story again. I&#039;m pretty sure this same guy was featured on the documentary &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Denied&quot; too. *shrugs* It&#039;s stilly pretty crazy though, really cool. I mean, besides the fact that whenever someone mentions a UFO their reputation is forever destroyed in the professional setting, even though the majority of humanity believes in life elsewhere. Oh the irony...<br />

Great link though :P Funny how we both ran into it. It&#039;s apparently like the second most popular link on the net right now. w00t for cnn linkage.</div>

		<div id="post_13604" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I saw a documentation a few months ago, where the outcome was, that the Roswell incident was actually a secret military experiment for a spy balloon to spy out russian weaponry during the cold war. At least that was what the us military claimed. And that was also the reason why the military came and let everything &quot;disappear&quot;.<br />
That doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t believe in other life or I believe that they tell the truth. Actually I had my own experience with a ufo, at least I guess so. When I was about 4-6 (can&#039;t remeber exactly) I saw some weird lights in the air, on after another going on and off, like big lamps in all different colors, about 20-30meters in the I think. But I can&#039;t be sure this is what actually happened, cause I just remembered years after that, that there was something strange about that, so it could be that my imagination modified my memory.<br />

Anyways, what do you think about that explanation about that secret military project?</div>
