		<div id="post_10545" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Honestly, I&#039;ve been working on breaking through mental barriers. My Subconsciousness and my Consciousness have no barrier other than name. Granted, I Haven&#039;t gotten down into the deeper parts of my mind, but I have unlocked my subconscious mind to the degree in which I have extremely heightened muscle control. (i.e. I can control heartbeat, eye dilation, muscles in my digestive tract to a degree, and muscles found within the skin that control the dilation of arteries and veins).<br />
<br />
If I&#039;m not mistaken there are certain mental gates. These gates can be opened in order to increase control of the human body, however; if you venture to far, you risk hitting the &quot;final&quot; gate, which is named so because it causes a system overload and death. The Final gate is probably not the true last that you can break, but it is the one that will kill you, It is the mental gate that makes heartbeat and other vital processes open to the conscience mind. This causes your mind to risk overload possibly because you consciously cipher through too much information at one time (like an overloaded processor on a computer) and cause a system shutdown.<br />

This came to me after trying to figure out what was causing my computer to shut down randomly during the day... As soon as I figured out the reason, It hit me...<br />

So truth be told, I haven&#039;t had to deal with limits like that for quite a while. Although I can say that If you know yourself, truthfully, you would understand the meaning of your dreams without much difficulty. Of you know that YOU wouldn&#039;t stab and cut people, then your subconscious wouldn&#039;t either. Your subconscious mind is just an acute extension of yourself. Basically you without any filtered information. Not affected by more then concept and desire ^_-. So just let yourself relax, and it will come to you in time... everything eventually does, so there&#039;s no reason to fret.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10545">Honestly, I&#039;ve been working on breaking through mental barriers. My Subconsciousness and my Consciousness have no barrier other than name. Granted, I Haven&#039;t gotten down into the deeper parts of my mind, but I have unlocked my subconscious mind to the degree in which I have extremely heightened muscle control. (i.e. I can control heartbeat, eye dilation, muscles in my digestive tract to a degree, and muscles found within the skin that control the dilation of arteries and veins).
