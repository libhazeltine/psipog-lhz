		<div id="post_14328" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I believe that in order for something to exist, there must be a fundamental foundation behind its existence.<br />
<br />
For example, we use gasoline to bring non living machines to life through combustion. Gasoline is made from fossil fuels, which are things that used to be alive.. (perhaps this is a bad example, but I like it)<br />
<br />
So, when we look at the nature of reality, how do we describe it?<br />
<br />
Well, nature is the playing field on which all things exist. <br />
<br />
ALL things. <br />
<br />
An INFINITE amount of possibilities..<br />
<br />
And how does this nature organize itself? Well, it creates neat little symmetrical patterns that maintain a healthy, well balanced system of growth which can be broken down into a simple mathematical constant, known as the golden ratio.. Phi = 1.61803399 - etc, etc. (Out of this ratio, we also see meridian points on a guitar string that give us musical scales.. yeah..)<br />
<br />
Im just going through information now..<br />
<br />
When we interact with nature, we are enduring a feedback process between the material, and our conscious will. Nature is giving us something to work with, and we transform it with our intention.. now that manipulated piece of nature is changing what we do with it.. and this is the feedback loop of creation.<br />
<br />
These are fundamental aspects of what we regard as biological reality.<br />
<br />
-neverending potential<br />
-phi<br />
-feedback<br />
<br />
Since phi is a reiterated (feedback) sequence of numbers, I think you can see a fundamental correlation between the two without too much effort, and since these things grow off each other, they create non-ending potential of growth.<br />
<br />
These three things would have no substance in reality, had they no foundation in infinity.. <br />
Reality would not be based on these things if infinity was not the truth of existance..<br />
<br />
I started this discussion for the feedback, questions, and concerns.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!</div>

The reason I bring it up is because I think it explains the miracle of psionics. Think about it? How else would someone draw information from any outside source? (remote viewing, telepathy). How else would someone be able to move things telekinetically?<br />

Pi is a different concept all together, (Pi is round, and wheels go on forever.. I know what you mean ;) but it is not a feedback equation being reiterated back in on itself. (ex. start with one.. one duplicates itself. 1+1=2.. now two exists along with *the one, and they add up 1+2=3.. the two is with three, 2+3=5.. 3+5=8, 5+8=13 etc. this is the fibonacci sequence. 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55..  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_ratio_line.svg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_ratio_line.svg</a>)<br />
<br />
My theory requires that matter and consciousness are dependant on one another. This is an issue if you look at it like &quot;how can the universe have existed before it existed.. then there is no beginning, no middle, or end and no story..&quot; but that is the beauty of this theory. Give me a second here..<br />
<br />
If consciousness were as infinite as the universe, then perhaps there could even be a being so evolved, that our level of consciousness is that of an ant in comparison. It may not even have a body at all it is so advanced. Well, even if a being was a million years older than us (which is nothing in space) they would have no concern in our affairs. That is because we are from a young, early evolved system in the universe.. <br />
<br />
and perhaps, the universe likes to start fresh all the time.. afterall, it is in mans nature to forget.<br />
<br />
I believe in evolution, and I believe that it is adjacent to our timeline. Memetics.. check it out!<br />
<br />
The thing with infinity, is that it gets bored, and it must play games.. us and all our little adventures are just passing moments in, infinity.<br />

Its like watching laguna beach with no reruns..<br />

Often I get carried away, so if things arn&#039;t so clear, I can try to explain it better.<br />

Since when does evolution always point in one direction?

<br />
Now those guys were from an early system.. :P<br />

They were not very good meme machines.. and they more or less killed the bible, so I think their role was sufficient to our evolution. <br />

This is interesting because with distance, all of life is fractal.<br />
<br />
Lets say you are traveling towards a dot of light in the distance, and the closer you get, the more you realize that this dot is actually a city, with all sorts of activity happening there. Same goes with the planet. Travel in, you see oceans and forests and cities, but travel out, and it just becomes a dot. And on a larger scale, this is eventually what happens to our galaxy.. it becomes a dot..<br />
Then try looking into a small dot..<br />
The dot disappears into all kinds of other dots.<br />
<br />
The planks length is so small, and dense, that if you filled a centimeter cubed space with planks length dots.. this centimeter cubed space would be more dense, than all the matter in the known universe, compacted into the same space.<br />
<br />
But what does that say?<br />
<br />
That the universe can be smaller than it is large? An imbalance..<br />
<br />
my unified field theory is coming.. first I must clear up a few things about fractal nature..<br />
<br />
Fractals are all about pattern! (I dont know about you, but I can find a few patterns in my own life.. ya know, a few themes..)<br />
<br />
Also, perhaps the strongest evidence for a fractal universe.. PEOPLE COME FROM OTHER PEOPLE!!<br />

If you photograph three generations of family together, you can see the similarities, and fractal evolution taking place..<br />

Im not too sure what deltaX is about.. but I dig it!</div>An elemental physics teacher would say that&#039;s (considering &quot;delta&quot; as the greek letter)the difference between the final X (position) and initial X. For example: 100 miles (distance) = 150 (where your subject stopped) - 50 (where your subject started walking) (don&#039;t ask me why our subject started walking at 50 miles).<br />

One way I have thought about this loop system, containing infinity from every point outward, would be an example of you as yourself looking through a telescope that could see into forever, and eventually, you would find yourself looking into the center of your own mind.. able to continue looking outward through your body once again.. and on into forever..</div>Like mirroring a mirror?<br />
Clarify how that makes the own people universe please.<br />
