It helps me. I have been haunted, and I learned quickly how to banish harmful spirits and the like, however; I find that the best offence is a good defence, in other words, you need to radiate the the feeling &quot;you can&#039;t harm me.&quot; or &quot;you have no power over me.&quot;... It&#039;s always helped me out when a spirit attacked me.<br />
<br />
Another Idea that you may want to consider however is it could be a product of your own paranoia. It&#039;s always possible that you have created something to represent your fears. Real spirit or not, always a good Idea to reflect on your true thoughts and beliefs.</div>

		<div id="post_8844" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Okay, well I have about twenty minutes now before kung fu...<br />
So I&#039;ll tell you one of my shadow experiences.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this was after having been into psionics for a couples years, and I hadn&#039;t had more than only a few real &#039;experiences&#039; yet, though those few included a couple short OBEs.<br />
<br />
I was left alone at my grandparents to watch the house one night while they went out of town(Their house was way out in the forest/mountains, so they usually stayed the night someplace when they left to the neighboring city)<br />
I&#039;d just finished watching tv and I&#039;d decided to go to bed since I was bored out of my mind and there was nothing else to do.<br />
The guest bedroom at the time was in their half-finished basement-- basically a cement cellar with tiny windows and a little carpeting. It was the kind of place where, if you shut off the lights, the darkness that followed felt as if it were sticking to your skin, and almost suffocating you. Not to mention the ear pounding silence that accompanied it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wasn&#039;t used to falling asleep in such a quiet place since I lived in town, so I driftted off into a trance and I &#039;clicked out&#039; into sleep.<br />
I dream normally for a while.. nothing odd there. But it eventually faded away, and I found myself awake in what I could tell was an OBE. (You can tell that when you&#039;re wide awake and sinking into your mattress frame that you&#039;re not in the solid anymore)<br />
<br />
I lay for a little exploring the sensation as my eyes started coming into focus.. but in the middle of my vision was a dark... blot, silhouetted by light from the lamp that I&#039;d left on before I went to sleep.   I focused a little harder, and it came into clear view; A humanoid shadow was hovering above and at the end of my bed.. but in the center of it&#039;s &quot;body&quot; was a hole. I&#039;d heard of shadow people before, but nothing like that.<br />
I got the sense that it knew I was awake at that point.  It shifted a little in the air, and my sense of temperature slowing started to increase, getting warmer and warmer, as if I were standing by a heater.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I was in a state of mind where I remained completely calm, and remembered something I&#039;d heard from a radio show about what to do if you&#039;re were ever in a situation like this.  I simply focused on myself like they said, and moved a finger on my hand. Once I did that, the figure immediately faded away, and my feelings  returned to normal.<br />
<br />
I got up and sat there staring at where the shadow had been for a while, and the realization of what had just happened slowly started seeping in to me... plus some feeling that, just because I couldn&#039;t see it anymore, didn&#039;t mean that it had exactly LEFT.  So after that,  I gathered my things, rather quickly, and went up stairs to sleep on the couch.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was my first experience like that, and the first in that house, but definitely not my last.  A week later when I came back to house-sit again, it got even a little bit weirder...   <br />
but ah, my time is up.  I&#039;ll post that experience some other time if you want it.  I need to head off to kung fu.<br />
(forgive any typos. I don&#039;t have time to spellcheck)</div>

		<div id="post_8977" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I once experienced what could be called magic... maybe group pyrokensis, but it was definitely some form of energy manipulation.  Anyway some family friends came over who were from a catholic school (i mention this because they said they learned it at school) and they brought with them a girl from their school.  We went down the backyard where a bonfire had once been, so the ground was all chard.  There were three of them, me and my brother, and we all sat in a circle around the chard ground.  in the middle one of them put  a stick they just randomly picked up off the ground that they broke into a shape of a crucifix.  they started chanting something (i tried to chant along but didnt know the words :P).  We switched sitting positions around the sticks so that who ever was face on with the stick was the person they channeled the spell through.  Anyways when i sat in-front of it, and they were chanting it immediately burst into flames.  <br />

I heard like a banging rattling noise coming from back behind the bathrooms. I thought to my self ??? and just continued making ablution. Then I heard it again I&#039;m like ??? ookkaayyyy. So then the third time freaked me out to much so I said allowed I seek refuge in God from satin the rejected one in Arabic. I then seen a shadow coming from the back going across the room in the shape of a running from not running though a shadow gliding across the room in the running form with like one leg up. I freaked out and ran upstairs lol.</div>
