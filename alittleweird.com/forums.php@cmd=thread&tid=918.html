		<div id="post_16407" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">My father said he saw a cool documentary on the Scythian Ice Maiden in the Altai mountains. The one he saw was really awesome, but I couldn&#039;t find it - it had been some low-quality video or something on a Russian channel. I found a BBC one (  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4nrpkHQoxc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4nrpkHQoxc</a> ) that has a lot of interesting details left out. It seems that there are those funny coincidences at work again.<br />
<br />
Father said that this place had a strange magnetic anomaly that seemed to have been affected by the people in the area. There had been someone with them who didn&#039;t feel very well and had started to call names. He left and when he did, the magnitude of the magnetic anomaly had risen about 30 times or something.<br />
<br />
There are rumors that one of the archaeologists had found a cave with interesting drawings. He entered the cave, started feeling weird. Then there was a gap in his memory and then he woke again, right in front of the cave. Colleagues said he had been lost for a few days.<br />
<br />
When the archaeologists reached the coffin, they started seeing bloody nightmares in their dreams. When they had managed to defrost the mummy and wanted to transport it, all of their cars stopped working - so they ordered a helicopter. While on their way, the helicopter engine suddenly died out and they had to perform an emergency landing. Then they somehow managed to transport it to some lab or something, but the fridge had suddenly broken down and when they opened the door, the mummy was degenerating and there were fungus growing on it already.<br />
<br />
A rumor has it that earthquakes have started to appear in the area for the first time after the mummy was taken away from the burial grounds.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone here knows a link to the original documentary?</div>
