As for what &quot;Insight&quot; said, it was quite insulting and without proof in itself. I&#039;ve always believed that fully &quot;debunking&quot; paranormal related subjects is close to impossible. The only things that you can really debunk are myths like the ones shown on Mythbusters. If Psipog, or psionics to that matter were truly debunked, there would be no arguments about whether they are real or not because when something is completely debunked, you cannot argue against it because they were debunked for good reasons, usually with facts. </div>

By showing that psipog is not proven to the scientific community, you could assume that stuff taught there could/would not survive the closer observation of science. This in turn would indicate the the stuff is is not real.

In reality the thing does not work like this, but this is the common chain of logic most of the opposing debaters follow.

		<div id="post_12310" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">  Meh, I&#039;ve come to accept the Trinary system of nature. Society tries to apply everything to either &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;, as a binary type of system is Ideal.<br />
<br />
  The fact of the matter is we have as of yet three things something could be. &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot; and &quot;Unproven/unprovable&quot;.<br />
<br />
  The way we try to erase this third and get back to an Ideal system also varies. We apply variables based on personal experience in other to turn &quot;Unproven/unprovable&quot; into either &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. This is partially what science was meant to do, clear up the third variable in order to make true understanding possible.<br />
<br />
  Other people apply other variables, for example, some people believe that if it falls under &quot;unproven/unprovable&quot; it must be false because it has not or cannot determine a &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; through scientific method.<br />
<br />
  You can also find other examples which follow suit. Take people who are religious, they believe that a god, deity, or higher being (which technically fall under the &quot;unproven/unprovable&quot; section) as &quot;True&quot; because of the variable that we commonly refer to as faith.<br />
<br />
  Unfortunately, due to the very nature of science you are only able to prove that something is as real as any other object or control. It fails to account for the idea that all the objects in question don&#039;t really exist. All it really serves to be able to prove is that either all objects in question are real or all objects in question are not real. It&#039;s a binary system, but not one that we as a society would favor simply because we cannot see it or control it. Because of this, we choose to believe that science works and that objects are real. All in all, it&#039;s just as much belief as any religion.<br />
<br />
  Religion has a different problem. There is no real basis for any of it but belief, It all falls under the power that persuasion and tradition have upon a person. This means that, provided I had the skill to persuade someone that something is true, then it is true (in this way, Science is a religion also, it uses comparison and math as a tool for persuasion). Tradition keeps it alive and causes it to grow, simple as that.<br />
