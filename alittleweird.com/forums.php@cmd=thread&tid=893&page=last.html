		<div id="post_16125" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi, I&#039;m Dream Shaper, and I have a problem.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s this girl who keeps appearing in my dreams. I can never get a look at her face. It&#039;s either covered by a hood, she&#039;s moving too fast to get a good look, she&#039;s invisible, etc. Here&#039;s what I do know: she&#039;s medium-height and slender with dirty blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders. And she keeps trying to kill me.<br />
<br />
It started rather innocently. She would just try to drop a piano on me as a prank. Now she&#039;s actively hunting me. This needs to stop.<br />
<br />
There was a time when I was able to determine what I would dream about. From there the solution is simple: dream of her attacking me, become lucid, then find out why she wants to kill me. But I can&#039;t do that anymore.<br />
<br />
So this thread is to document my process of raising my mental powers until I can confront her unafraid. Weird enough for you?<br />
<br />
Anyway, first thing I need to do is regain decent dream recall. So, I&#039;ll meditate for 10 minutes, followed by meditating for 5 minutes on remembering my dreams. I know you&#039;ll just be bored with all the dreams&#039; details, so I&#039;ll just rate them based on clarity, cohesiveness, quantity, length, etc. Wish me luck!</div>

What you should do, is just face the demons in your dreams. After they&#039;ve tried what ever they want (your subconcsious..), they&#039;ll just disappear and in those dreams you may not die, and even if you die you just reincarnate in immediate second. So, those problems are just in your thoughts, and as soon as you face them, you&#039;ll get rid of them. It isn&#039;t that easy, &#039;cause we&#039;ve learnt for our whole life to avoid problems etc. and now we are told to face them. Just try if you&#039;re enough conscious in your dreams, and see what happens. Don&#039;t try to avoid your problems, deal with them.</div>

Obviously, you are meant to be afraid of the girl. In the structure of the dream, you will probably be unable to kill her. I&#039;m assuming that no matter what you do, she will continue to pursue you.<br />
<br />
Keep with the dream training, and try to get her to attack you in a lucid dream. Then, once you control the world that you&#039;re in, kill her, and hope she stays vanquished.</div>

Felicks advice is good: to instigate this dream while you are lucid. <br />
<br />
There is also a small possibility that someone is trying to do a switcheroo on you, where you develop abilities, and when you are ready, this entity in your dream might lead you to your real target, someone who looks like that girl.<br />
<br />
The one thing I would strongly recommend, though, is that you protect yourself. Never, ever, ever let yourself die in a dream. It is bad policy.</div>

		<div id="post_16133" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Some tips for dream recall:<br />
<br />
This is something I just figured out, and it is stupid, but it seems to work well. When I wake up in the morning, and it seems like all dreams are just wiped, I tell myself that I would like to remember them, then I start thinking of a song, anything that comes to mind, and I keep this song playing in my head. Some minutes later the memories of the dreams return. <br />
<br />
Another thing that helps is to drink a lot of water right before going to sleep, this wakes me up during the night, and while I&#039;m up, I write down dreams. (I use beverages instead of an alarm, because if I were to use the alarm to wake up 2-3 times during the night, the neighbours would start to hate my guts.)<br />

I really like SL&#039;s suggestion that she is meant to be a teacher. Thanks! However, why do you say not to die? I&#039;m generally granted sufficient super-powers to stay alive, so it&#039;s not usually a problem. I was slaughtered by Darth Maul once, and nothing bad happened; the dream just ended.

Some believe that death in dreams or OOBEs is death in real life. Although, this is difficult to prove though,but people die in their sleep all the time. <br />
<br />
If you are into the psion stuff, I would highly recommend attacking this girl with their types of methods (psi balls, telepathic suggestions, various bombardments such as lightning strikes) rather than the physical knuckles or weapons (steel, guns) methods. <br />

It might be a good idea for you to get involved with some form of martial arts, if you are not already.<br />

		<div id="post_16186" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Ahh dreams. Dreams are as complex or basic as our mind wants to make them, but an important lesson is taught through dreams. This lesson can arguably be called one of the most invaluable of all. This can at least be confirmed by any with affinity to passive &#039;powers&#039;.<br />
<br />
One is not to judge by the appearance, the tell-tale visage of the world, but rather by its substance. Dreams are no exception. You see who she is in the confounds of appearance, clothing, demeanor, that is usually half the whole story and quarter of the real message and a sliver of what really matters. The realm of reality confounded within the matrix of our mind, dreams, they come with a certain &quot;air&quot; to them. One can identify others more accurately not by how they are, what they are, but who they are in the sense of how they feel. The air of the dream will tell treasures troves of what you need to know. Although curiosity must be spiked in what this rambling soul means when the world &quot;air&quot; is presented.<br />
<br />
Just as &quot;vibes&quot; can be felt in the world of the waking, our humble reality, can we too feel them in dreams. It is an over encompassing thickness that comes from the atmosphere of your lovely dreaming realm. People too have feelings. Feel her, do not see her, understand who she is. Meditate on her, meditate on not the content of the dream, but the feeling of the dream. Just as emotions are linked to thoughts, the reasons, the information behind it, feelings too are linked to the information behind them. No question comes without an answer, but as a follower of the road of knowledge I must warn you that all too often one answer will only yield two more questions, fours more curiosities, and insight not on how much one knows, but about how much one does not.<br />
<br />
Study the feelings of your dream and understand them well for no one can give you your true solution short of yourself, and even revered masters can only serve as guides. Although that is not to imply I am a master of any sort, but to serve as general word of advice. I hope it helps.</div>

<br />
I understand that the topic has already been addressed somewhat, but with regards to death or dying in dreams, has anyone had a dream in which they died and experienced the death?<br />
<br />
For instance, I&#039;ve had a dream where I&#039;ve been stabbed, but when I was stabbed I did not die, rather my perspective within the dream changed from, what one might call, first person to third person.  In otherwords, I was in my body, but at the point where I should have died, I saw the incident from a 3rd party perspective rather than experiencing the death, or even the end of the dream.  <br />
<br />
In some other dreams, things happened to me where I should have died, but I did not die.<br />
<br />
In most other instances, I&#039;ve woken up when or before I should&#039;ve died - such as just before colliding with the ground.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard proposals that when one dies in a dream, their body dies too, but of course such a proposal is difficult to prove, especially with little means for proper measurement.  Any ideas on the topic?</div>

The explanation I had heard for that was that the brain is active during your dreams; it&#039;s interacting with and reacting to the stimuli it receives in your dream. If it receives the message &quot;Shut down, it&#039;s finished.&quot; it will... Just a wild guess and recollection of a discussion about dreams in class a few years ago, though...</div>

No has yet said, or even mentioned, that the girl in the dream could represent something in his life. DreamShaper, You need to think about who this girl is and who or even what she reminds you of. Are you playing any games that could relate to the dream? Do you watch a tv series that could relate to it, something at school or work? Or even in your family?<br />
