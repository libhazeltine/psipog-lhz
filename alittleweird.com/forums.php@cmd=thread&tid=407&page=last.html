If you look on the published work, There is a man that is only known as &quot;Simon&quot;. Interestingly enough, This person in question has ties to the church of satan, which has also published books such as &quot;grimoire for the Green Witch&quot; and many other ritualistic books of Magick.<br />
<br />
The Title for the book came to Lovecraft in a dream, possibly more too? Anyone who looks at this from a Psions veiw point can understand the possibilities that lie in dreams. The oddest part about it is that The Necronomicon is not only based on Sumerian Mythology (not mesopotamian), but also History. <br />
<br />
The Reason why I titled this Truth within lies is because the experiences we encounter with Ouija boards and the necronomicon are just that. They have significant hiden truths which make them entising, but hide it within a torrent of Lies and Deciet in order to turn you. That&#039;s why Ouija boards, the Necronomicon, heck, even the Lord of the Rings series is so popular. <br />
<br />
I am not using it as a reference book, rather, I&#039;m using reference books in order to pull out the truth from the book, and therefore get a better Idea of the Intent of The Necronomicon.<br />
<br />
In truth, my ultimate goal is to figure out the whole occult side of WWII and then write a book on all of the information I have gathered over time.</div>

Both Sumerian and Mesopotamian are correct, since Mesopotamia is a geographical region where Sumer was located, and the book also contains some Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian mythology, so I thought I&#039;d use Mesopotamian instead of Sumerian.</div>

		<div id="post_9067" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hmm, thanks for the Clarification.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to explain my finding so far is to post a few links. I&#039;ll note certain ones for their relevance, what I found on the page, and info of the like. Then I will post the noted I&#039;ve made that discribe connections between texts.<br />
<br />
The main thing that has been stopping me is that I am lacking information to make a complete statement. I will try as best as possible however to display the information I have gathered so far.<br />
<br />
This is a pretty extensive list, it includes many pages that I use for modern symbolism, alchemy, masonry, etc. There are many of these in order to gain a less biased description of each symbol. This helps me learn the full adaptation of the information from past to future.<br />
<br />
Now, for the links;<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.digital-brilliance.com/necron/necron.htm" target="_blank">http://www.digital-brilliance.com/necron/necron.htm</a> - This is FAQ of the Necronomicon from the standpoint of a believer. There are many lies in the texts, many things that aren’t trustworthy and are noted so. However; I have found key details here that piqued my interest. Remember, in the best lies there are always hidden truths to them, you just have to root them out. In other words, the best liar is the one who tells half truths. In here I got the idea to look for the history that the Necronomicon is referring to.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id25.html" target="_blank">http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id25.html</a> - Here is where I found the actual history of the Necronomicon, which seems to be more based around the biography of H.P. Lovecraft. It also points to the first references to “Simon” who published the copy of the Necronomicon we can find in most bookstores. This is the person I’m interested in, I want to know what his purpose for publishing such a book would be. I have some theories, none of them good. The oddest part Simons copy of the Necronomicon is that is doesn’t add up to Lovecraft’s style, which leads me to believe that something just isn’t right about Simons Necronomicon.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Wicca%20&amp;%20Witchcraft/occult_signs_and_symbols.htm" target="_blank">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Wicca%20&amp;%20Witchcraft/occult_signs_and_symbols.htm</a> - This is a Really biased list of occult symbolism that I use to get a cristian grasp of these ideas,  It’s my comic relief...<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.realmagick.com/" target="_blank">http://www.realmagick.com/</a> - This is a Library of information that I use for the base of most of my studies. If I find something interesting here, I then expand on it by gathering more information from other websites; this is just a small reference for me.<br />

<br />
 <a href="http://www.spelwerx.com/rarebooks.html" target="_blank">http://www.spelwerx.com/rarebooks.html</a> - This is where I started to become interested in Enochian Magicks and the John Dee Publication Project, the only special part about this is that is sells Many Spell books of questionable origins. That and The Sigilum Dei Aemeth used in Enochian Magicks to Align the caster’s energy to the Heptarchic energy that is required.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24332/Rowe_-Benjamin---Enochian-Magick-Reference" target="_blank">http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24332/Rowe_-Benjamin---Enochian-Magick-Reference</a> - This is the first bit of study I did on the Enochan Magick. It seems enticing, but there is too much room for… corruption.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.yoga-age.com/modern/philosophy/phylosophy16.html" target="_blank">http://www.yoga-age.com/modern/philosophy/phylosophy16.html</a> - This is a break I took from my usual studies in which I broke off into Yoga, just something to separate myself from the usual.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://psychicvampirism.com/" target="_blank">http://psychicvampirism.com/</a> - I took the time here to gather some information on Psychic Vampirism, I had this information before, but I needed to put it back in my favorites, It may have some usefulness.<br />

<br />
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_angel" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_angel</a>#Fallen_angels_by_rank – continued looking for the Heptarchy (sp?) they were talking about in Enochian Magicks.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_alphabet" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_alphabet</a> - just a side Study I got into, This may be something I start studying more to tie up my study of occult history, but as of now this is just a small section of my studies.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://van.physics.uiuc.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1363" target="_blank">http://van.physics.uiuc.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1363</a> – I was wondering about current theories on how energy becomes matter, since matter becomes energy on a day to day basis (see Black holes)<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.geocities.com/digital3v14/texts/sumerdic.htm" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/digital3v14/texts/sumerdic.htm</a> - this is Recent. I started Delving into the actual Sumerian Language here.

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9067">Hmm, thanks for the Clarification.

I think the best way to explain my finding so far is to post a few links. I&#039;ll note certain ones for their relevance, what I found on the page, and info of the like. Then I will post the noted I&#039;ve made that discribe connections between texts.

The main thing that has been stopping me is that I am lacking information to make a complete statement. I will try as best as possible however to display the information I have gathered so far.

This is a pretty extensive list, it includes many pages that I use for modern symbolism, alchemy, masonry, etc. There are many of these in order to gain a less biased description of each symbol. This helps me learn the full adaptation of the information from past to future.

Now, for the links;

http://www.digital-brilliance.com/necron/necron.htm - This is FAQ of the Necronomicon from the standpoint of a believer. There are many lies in the texts, many things that aren’t trustworthy and are noted so. However; I have found key details here that piqued my interest. Remember, in the best lies there are always hidden truths to them, you just have to root them out. In other words, the best liar is the one who tells half truths. In here I got the idea to look for the history that the Necronomicon is referring to.

http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id25.html - Here is where I found the actual history of the Necronomicon, which seems to be more based around the biography of H.P. Lovecraft. It also points to the first references to “Simon” who published the copy of the Necronomicon we can find in most bookstores. This is the person I’m interested in, I want to know what his purpose for publishing such a book would be. I have some theories, none of them good. The oddest part Simons copy of the Necronomicon is that is doesn’t add up to Lovecraft’s style, which leads me to believe that something just isn’t right about Simons Necronomicon.

http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Wicca%20&amp;%20Witchcraft/occult_signs_and_symbols.htm - This is a Really biased list of occult symbolism that I use to get a cristian grasp of these ideas,  It’s my comic relief...

http://www.realmagick.com/ - This is a Library of information that I use for the base of most of my studies. If I find something interesting here, I then expand on it by gathering more information from other websites; this is just a small reference for me.

http://www.the-night.net/pagan/pagansymbols.htm -  Pagan &amp; Alchemic Symbolism 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta37.htm - This is The Theory and Practice of Alchemy, something that has interested me since I was young. This is the Description of both the earthly form of Alchemy (chemistry) and the Spiritual aspects of it.

http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements//pages/alchemist/alchemy.html - More common Symbols in Alchemy.

http://www.goldentreewands.com/symbolmagic.htm - Even More Symbols of Alchemy

http://www.spelwerx.com/rarebooks.html - This is where I started to become interested in Enochian Magicks and the John Dee Publication Project, the only special part about this is that is sells Many Spell books of questionable origins. That and The Sigilum Dei Aemeth used in Enochian Magicks to Align the caster’s energy to the Heptarchic energy that is required.

http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24332/Rowe_-Benjamin---Enochian-Magick-Reference - This is the first bit of study I did on the Enochan Magick. It seems enticing, but there is too much room for… corruption.

http://www.yoga-age.com/modern/philosophy/phylosophy16.html - This is a break I took from my usual studies in which I broke off into Yoga, just something to separate myself from the usual.

http://psychicvampirism.com/ - I took the time here to gather some information on Psychic Vampirism, I had this information before, but I needed to put it back in my favorites, It may have some usefulness.

http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_vampire - Same as above

http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/prophecy/seven-heads.htm - Here I have returned to my studies of Heptarchic magicks, I wanted to learn a little more on the seven kings they were meaning.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_angel#Fallen_angels_by_rank – continued looking for the Heptarchy (sp?) they were talking about in Enochian Magicks.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_alphabet - just a side Study I got into, This may be something I start studying more to tie up my study of occult history, but as of now this is just a small section of my studies.

http://van.physics.uiuc.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1363 – I was wondering about current theories on how energy becomes matter, since matter becomes energy on a day to day basis (see Black holes)

http://www.geocities.com/digital3v14/texts/sumerdic.htm - this is Recent. I started Delving into the actual Sumerian Language here. I wanted to see what kind of accuracy the Necronomicon had to the Sumerian language. i.e. If certain words seen in the Necronomicon actually meant those words.

http://www.ping.de/sites/systemcoder/necro/info/sumerian.htm - this is Sumerian drawn strait from the Necronomicon… not the best reference, but a required one for me to make.

http://home.comcast.net/~chris.s/assyrbabyl-faq.html - Something I am currently reading and something that is helping me understand the connection between Sumer and Babylonia, This is very interesting and I need to read further here.
