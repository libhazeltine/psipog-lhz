Highlight the following white text if you don&#039;t mind spoilers. If you want this to remain just a series of mysterious and creepy videos, don&#039;t read what I wrote...<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">Marble Hornets is fake, guys... It&#039;s a series of videos relating to &quot;Slenderman&quot;. Slenderman is a monster created as a contest entry on Something Awful in which you had to create a creepy image or something like that... At about half the thread, the entry for Slenderman was posted and then he slowly took over the entire thread, becoming a full-blown urban legend.<br />
<br />
It started with regular images and somewhere in the image someone would use image editing programs to add in an extremely tall man with several appendages wearing a suit. Sometimes he stood on two long legs, sometimes he was supported by the appendages. Kinda like Where&#039;s Waldo...<br />
<br />
He&#039;s said to lure people to him by hypnotizing them somehow (&lt;--- I think that&#039;s what I remember reading...) and also to be responsible for many disappearances (Let the <em>&quot;The mutilated bodies of [insert number] children who were said to have disappeared last month were found in the forest near [insert location].&quot;</em> flow; that&#039;s what usually happens in the stories...)<br />
<br />
Marble Hornets was created as a creepypasta (Creepypastas are creepy stories, videos, etc. for those who don&#039;t know...) relating to Slenderman.<br />
<br />
All this can be confirmed by looking at entry #4... At one point, you see a man with no face (Like Slenderman) wearing a black suit, walking just out of sight when the cameraman jumps at a movement behind him. You can also see it on his balcony in Entry #1... (They&#039;re the only 2 that don&#039;t have any sound...)<br />
<br />
Those who decide to actively look into Marble Hornets either don&#039;t know this or are just in it because it can get pretty creepy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here&#039;s a fun fact about Slenderman. Slenderman was the nickname of William Clark, some kind of threshing contractor from the UK. In March 1877, he murdered a man named Henry Walker and was then hanged at Lincoln Castle, Lincolnshire. <br />
<br />
I found a biography by the 3xgreat-grand-son of a man named William Clark, born in Lissington, Lincolnshire, but the dates (Put in psychiatric hospital in 1866 and dying in 1886.) and cause of death (<strong>Suicide</strong> by hanging himself at Lincoln Castle.) aren&#039;t the same... Maybe one of the sources got the dates wrong, but 2 on 3 say March 1877.</span></div>

		<div id="post_16286" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Just pointing out: Up &#039;til now, the general opinion is Slenderman. Anywhere other than this guy&#039;s twitter, IRC, Youtube channel, whatever, that mentions Marble Hornets clearly state it&#039;s Slenderman... Personally, I think that&#039;s the most plausible explanation, with the man in the vids fitting the images (Blank face, black silhouette.) By the way, that&#039;s not a cape... Pause Entry 1 and go to the frame where you see him; you can see a white collar. And of course he doesn&#039;t stand 10&#039; tall; it&#039;s a home-made video... I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s hard finding a 10 foot tall man with a completely blank face and tentacles sticking out of his shoulders and hips... But have you ever read Slenderman stories? That stalker approach is usually the one taken; the person walks around and sees a weird silhouette behind them and soon notice it&#039;s following them. (One of the original series of pictures, notably...) Or they just see it through the window.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly; it&#039;s not that sloppy. The guy&#039;s slowly updating with more footage, building up the suspense, etc. The thing about no volume shows that he wanted to hide the footsteps; Slenderman walks on his appendages, usually.<br />
<br />
But I&#039;m curious too, so just in case this isn&#039;t fake and if it is, just for fun, I&#039;ll try finding clues if I can... I would be excited if it wasn&#039;t just another Slenderman story, but as of now, that&#039;s what the footage indicates, sadly...</div>
