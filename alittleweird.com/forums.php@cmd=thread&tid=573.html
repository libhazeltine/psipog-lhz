		<div id="post_11549" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I read an answer by Rainsong on pispog(I forgot the exact words), she said that practicing psionics can cause high blood pressure...severe enough to cause death... Also I found people talking about eletro/pyro kinesis are dangeous and can cause plenty of harm...even death. I&#039;m not taking everything I see into me but I want to discuss a bit more about this. And I don&#039;t want people starting to get scared and stop practicing psionics, because the purpose of this discussion will be focused on how to stay healthy.<br />
<br />
Based on everything I know and found out from others, I got a few conclusions...<br />
1. If you believe it will not harm you for sure, it won&#039;t...(it will but not as much at least)<br />
2. Meditation restores the order in your body(I derived this myself, but it might be written somewhere else because I think this one is pretty straight forward)<br />
<br />
Tests can be used to make sure our hypothesis, or even if we can be harmed by practicing psionics...<br />
<br />
<br />
One more things about myself...I can&#039;t seem to relax lately, getting frustrated all the time and doing not as well in my school works and such... And if I just put a psiwheel in front of myself it spins whether I want it to or not...Even when I TRY to clear my mind...and just relax on doing nothing, perhaps even on not moving the psiwheel but it didn&#039;t really work out well. My mind is stressed. That&#039;s so bad... perhaps I should eat/sleep/meditate/exercise more, and spend time on the computer/eat junk food/eat high fat food/stir up trouble(yeah its a horrible habit)/stress myself less. Well that will serve as a note to self =p<br />
<br />
And so, if anyone, I will be the one to experience all the bad things that psionics might have first...(yeah I think bad things can happen, but death is highly unlikely), and thus my experiement begin as of today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, one more thing,(promise it&#039;s the last thing) if you put facts please site them so I&#039;ll know the source(more credibility), or quote them and try to remember who wrote it, maybe something about the person who said it so I can get an understanding of how credible of that person. I will consider anything you say as long as it feels logical, since it will probably based on opinions.<br />
<br />
PS: I really look forward to some real evidence ^^<br />

When you work out, your muscles get stressed, your heart rate goes up, your blood pumps faster, etc. According to Rainsong, when you practice psionics, your blood sugar level rises and all that stuff happens. But it doesnt stay that way, you just rest for a while and it goes back to normal. And like working out, with practice, your system can take more after a while. About the death thing, its not likely to happen. Like working out, if your a beginner and you try to run 20 miles, you will probably die. Psionics is the same way. Really, you dont have much to worry about IMO. Just dont be a moron. </div>

would it fry your brain and make you dumb when practicing eletrokinesis? people say that it can harm your vital organs, so why not brain? <br />

Not sure if you put a shield around yourself will work here, especially for the ones who are not specialized in shields(it was a suggestion I saw somewhere, but I don&#039;t think it will really work)<br />

When I move my fingers around while focusing on them, I can feel this pull that&#039;s pressuring on my fingers to make them go closer and closer. I called it glue because it feels like my fingers are sticked together by some thick substance, it&#039;s sticky in a non-stick way...I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s related to electrokinesis, this just happened so randomly when I get bored =p, or in a class by some random teacher teaching me random stuff with some random guys sitting randomly around me.
