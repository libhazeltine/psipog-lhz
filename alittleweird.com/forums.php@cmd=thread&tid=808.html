		<div id="post_14553" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Okay... I&#039;m not sure where to start this so let&#039;s begin from where I got the idea from. (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been discussed before, but I haven&#039;t seen any topic here or on Veritas about it so might as well...)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really into anything that has to do with conspiracies and computer hacking, so I decided to rewatch the Matrix today.. I hadn&#039;t watched it in a few years and now I see I had understood... well... nothing of the movies the last time I had watched them... Now that I think of it, a simulated reality is a possible way to interpret our world. The concept of reality hacking is this: interpreting our world as a computer and every single object, phenomenon, etc. as programs.<br />
<br />
That leads us to the thought that, basically, the way we&#039;ve been viewing our universe (we = me, at least :P) is pretty close to the same idea. They even mention it once in the movie (not sure which one of the 3, though): What we define as reality is nothing but vibrations and electrical impulses of our brains. In the Matrix, this is how they manage to &#039;hack&#039; reality and bend the rules, they just view the world as a series of vibrations and electrical signals.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not suggesting that we&#039;re being played into thinking that we&#039;re in a virtual reality (although it could be possible) but we must admit that what we&#039;ve been talking about here is quite the same thing: We&#039;re bending the rules, the laws of physics, and, also, breaking them when we need to.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering this: If someone feels more comfortable with a certain environment, me, for example, I have absolutely no problem visualizing and interpreting how computers, networks and programs work. Shouldn&#039;t interpreting the world as such an environment help someone in their training in the metaphysical?<br />
<br />
Example: You levitate and object, or you simply move one with a thought: You&#039;re breaking the rules of physics, just like hackers break the rules established within a program. By levitating, you defy gravity and by moving an object you create movement without any physical force.<br />
<br />
I also like to think that it always all comes down to micro-PK, so here&#039;s another example: When doing telepathy, you basically send signals to the other person&#039;s brain. Brain signals are electrical impulses, so in fact, what you&#039;re doing is sending little shocks into the other person&#039;s head, making them &#039;hear&#039; your thoughts. Do I need to explain why sending electricity into someone else&#039;s brain is against the laws of physics? :P<br />
<br />
<strong>So long story short (for the lazy ones):</strong> If someone views the world as an environment more understandable to them, do you think it would make it easier for them to perform metaphysical arts? This could come in handy to someone who has a difficult time grasping the concept to psi, etc.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have too much trouble with it, but it would certainly help if I saw the world as a computer, as I&#039;m much more comfortable with the world of networks and mainframes.<br />
<br />
Of course, such a thing would have its disadvantages, such as not understanding the world as it truly is. How do you translate the Astral Sphere into computer language? unless your virtual world is withing a virtual world, etc., but that gets pretty complicated ^_^<br />
<br />
Give me your thoughts! And I&#039;m curious, has anyone tried this before? I certainly will as soon as possible.</div>

They explain the world in the way that you described. Basically, they view this world as an illusion, if you will, manifested in our minds. And, as you pointed out, it gets more complicated, as there are other, higher planes that may be viewed in a similar way.<br />
<br />
As for viewing the world as a computer program to better understand psionics, why not? It is simply the symbolism or allusion you choose to use to explain and understand the workings of this reality.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question as to whether I think this view would benefit your psionic practice, absolutely. It would seem that any expansion of our knowledge of reality and of the workings of things would only raise our capabilities and increase the efficiency of our visualizations. In my personal experience, understanding the nature of reality, that all of this is just an illusion manifested in our minds, has greatly increased my perception and understanding of psionics and other such &#039;phenomena.&#039;</div>

		<div id="post_14598" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Lets say someone writes a computer program to run on its own using random number generators to define events over the course of time. You are in a room watching on a computer monitor the course of this program. However, unbeknownst to you, the programmer wrote in a line of code that allows for user input, in place of a random number. <br />
<br />
The universe is simply a large system, defined by rules, with a specific set of start parameters, playing out its course influenced by tons of random events along the way (quantum events). However, if those events were not truly random, if a source outside of the &#039;program&#039; such as a non-localized consciousness (a ghost in the machine, if you will), had influence over the random events, it would change the state of things without actually violating any rules whatsoever. You see where I am going with this...<br />
