<br />
So let&#039;s say I get that ball appear. I want to assure myself it&#039;s really there by changing the temperature of it to something colder. It&#039;s normal that my hands get warmer when doing psi balls, but that can easily be explained by body-heat rising. I want them cold. I try visualising it like a snowball. Then I try to recreate the feeling of holding a darn cold snowball without any gloves on. You know that painfully cold feeling in your hands going numb and freezing your poor flesh and blood. :P<br />
<br />
I can keep doing this for a max of 20-30 mins before I give up. Either I lose that psi ball between my hands feeling, or it just keep getting warmer. <br />
<br />
Note: I am relaxed when doing it and most of the time calm and focused when attempting this.<br />

I feel exactly the same feeling everytime around the psiball, no matter how I visualize it. I didn&#039;t expect to get better at it right away, but I also didn&#039;t expect that my visualizing had no effect at all on the psiballs I make.

As far as cold psi balls are concerned, I have a favorite visualization: I always use an image of that spell Frozen Orb from Diablo 2 as my image of choice, complete with sound effect (a little sound adds depth to the visualization), because it sticks out in my mind. Find something similarly meaningful for your visualization. Of course, you could also visualize a thermometer sticking out of the psi ball reading a low temperature.

You can pretty much bet that if you do or say something that sets off my BS detector, I&#039;ll call you on it. Anyone who was at the Psipog forums frequently before they archived them can attest to that. Actually, by my standards, what I said to you was nowhere near mean, nor was it picking on you. And if you can&#039;t handle a little criticism, you really don&#039;t need to be dabbling in psionics.<br />
<br />
Corpse didn&#039;t call cold &quot;energy.&quot; He called it &quot;a lack of energy.&quot; Also, I criticized his post too. The part where I pointed out something that might be easier. Or did you just not read that part? But to his credit, his theory at least made some sense.<br />
<br />
Yes, motion comes from energy. It&#039;s called kinetic energy, if my memory serves. However, that doesn&#039;t mean that cold is energy. Cold is the ABSENCE of molecular motion, which would mean it&#039;s the ABSENCE of force, which leads to it being an ABSENCE of energy. Take a 9th grade physical science class.<br />
<br />
What &quot;my position on cold psi balls is?&quot; You sound as though I&#039;ve claimed they can&#039;t be made. They can, I do it all the time. I prefer to make cold ones rather than warm ones, to remove the whole &quot;your body heat is affecting it&quot; variable. I&#039;m not quite sure what you mean by &#039;powerful,&#039; but they don&#039;t have to be complex. Actually, my opinion is that the simpler you can make it, the easier it will be.<br />
<br />
You can &quot;show me where your shoe fits,&quot; eh? What are you, thirteen? If you can&#039;t calmly and adaquately defend your ideas against someone playing &quot;Devil&#039;s Advocate,&quot; what are you going to do when someone who doesn&#039;t believe anything you say comes along? &quot;You argued with my belief in psychic abilities, so I&#039;m gonna kick your ass!&quot; Grow up.</div>

<br />
You are correct (in my opinion) about the complicated shield talk. There&#039;s not much need to program the construct to move the heat energy outside of itself. Just program it to be cold. No sense in over-complicating it. Now, if it makes sense to the person doing the programming to visualize it doing that, then by all means, go ahead. By the way, I&#039;ve also heard of people taking cold showers, etc... to get the feeling of &#039;cold&#039; down. Though every time I&#039;ve heard of it, it was for cryokinesis, not psi balls. Me, I like my warm showers too much :D<br />
<br />
*Googles Peter Molyneux, out of curiosity*<br />
<br />
Ah, so that&#039;s what you meant by powerful. I usually define a powerful psi ball as one that&#039;s got lots of energy, but even that is arbitrary.<br />
<br />
So, apology accepted, and sorry if I come off a little mean. Like I said, I pick on EVERYONE. Even in real life.</div>
