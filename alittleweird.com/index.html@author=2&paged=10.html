				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling with this idea of &#8220;deserving to win the lottery&#8221; for a little while now, and I&#8217;ve finally found the solution.  First, let me describe my original conflict.</p>
<p>With intention manifestation, some say it&#8217;s important to feel as though you <em>deserve</em> whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to manifest.  My problem with this idea is that to feel as though you <em>deserve</em> something is really asking for trouble.  It&#8217;s being rude to reality.  It&#8217;s my belief that reality will determine what you deserve, using precise and exact judgment.  If you feel as though you deserve something, and reality disagrees, then you&#8217;re setting yourself up for disappointment and suffering.</p>
<p>So my solution to that was to never feel as though I deserved anything.  I hated seeing people do nothing and feel as though they deserve something.  It&#8217;s rude.  If you want something, then go after it.  Work hard for it, and attain it.  It seemed as though this feeling of &#8220;deserving&#8221; would get in the way.  Whenever I think of it, I envision a bad employee who always complains about how they deserve a raise, or deserve longer breaks, or more benefits.  Quit complaining, and go get it!  Stop wallowing, stop feeling as though you deserve something you haven&#8217;t earned, and get off your ass and do something about it!</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230;</p>
<p>Those were my old thoughts.  I still like most of them, but I&#8217;ve altered them slightly now that I&#8217;ve found a solution.</p>
<p>I now agree that it&#8217;s important to feel as though you deserve whatever you&#8217;re intending to manifest.  And my negativity associated with &#8220;deserving&#8221; has been removed.  Let me explain my new thoughts&#8230; (sorry if this turns out to be a little long-winded):</p>
<p>I live in Maryland, and went on vacation in Georgia, where my family lives.  We went to see an Atlanta Braves baseball game, and I couldn&#8217;t help but notice all the attractive females walking around :-).  One thing I really miss about Georgia is all the smoking hot females.  Of all the places I&#8217;ve lived, Georgia definitely has the most beautiful women.</p>
<p>I was also admiring the skill of the baseball players.  I was thinking about how hard they worked to achieve their goal of playing in the majors.  How much training and hard work they must have gone through, just to perform gracefully and correctly.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I tried to imagine a world where every person lived up to their potential.  Where every single person found their dream job, and worked hard to achieve their goals.  Where every person exercised, ate healthy, and was beautiful.  I tried to imagine what that world would be like.  Would it be better than our world?  What would it be like if every last person on the planet was successful to their highest potential?</p>
<p>My mind started to create this world, so I could see how it would function.  First I envisioned a baseball pitcher becoming the best he could&#8230; throwing the fastest and most precise pitches.  Then I thought how this perfect pitcher would strike everyone out&#8230; But then I remembered - the batter would also live up to his highest potential.  Each player would be the perfect batter, and could hit any pitch exactly where they wanted.  I saw that baseball would still exist in this perfect world, because competition would still be valid.  Perfect players playing against perfect players still produces a great game.</p>
<p>Then I started to think about perfect females.  Then I envisioned myself living up to my potential.  Healthy, strong, smart, fun, compassionate, etc.  Everything maxed out.  While looking out over the crowd of fans, I envision every man and women in the stands as living up to their potential.  I imagined all of us had achieved all our goals, and were living healthy and happy lives.</p>
<p>After playing this out in my head for a while, I realized that it would be a pretty kick ass place to live in.  Everyone would be happy, and there would be very little problems in the world.  We would all be rich.  We would all support each other.  It would be really great.</p>
<p>This was when I realized the real meaning of the word &#8220;deserve&#8221;.  I realized that we all deserve to live in a world like that.  I deserve to live up to my highest potential.  But you, the reader, also deserve me to live up to my highest potential.  And I deserve you to live up to yours.  And you deserve it as well.</p>
<p>I realized that I actually deserve to win the lottery.  But so does anyone else who also sets that as a goal.  It&#8217;s not really about earning it&#8230; it&#8217;s more about realizing that the world could be like my day dream.  It&#8217;s possible for all of us to live in a world where each person has lived up to their potential.  We all need to work for it.  You deserve to accomplish your goals because they are your goals!  And I deserve to have a reader who has accomplished their goals!  So don&#8217;t let me down :-P.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m not explaining it correctly.  My old thought pattern was that you get what you deserve.  Reality determines what you deserve.  So don&#8217;t complain about what you&#8217;re looking at, because reality has served it to you.  If you think you deserve something else, then work for it.</p>
<p>My new thought pattern is that it&#8217;s possible for us to live in a world where everyone has lived up to their potential.  And we deserve to simply because it&#8217;s possible.  We shouldn&#8217;t settle for any less.  We can create a perfect world, so we must.  Anything less wouldn&#8217;t be fair.  From this root, I see that I deserve to win the lottery, simply because it&#8217;s my goal, and I deserve to accomplish my goals.  It&#8217;s on my path towards living up to my potential.  And you deserve a webmaster who has lived up to his potential!  So I won&#8217;t let you down :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea for me, because I&#8217;m not used to thinking like this.  I&#8217;m sure many of you out there have realized what I&#8217;ve written in your own unique ways.  But I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve finally realized it for myself :-).   Step 1. Randomness doesn&#8217;t exist.  Step 2. I deserve to live up to my potential.  Step 3&#8230;.? <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>(Also: After finishing this post, I just checked my most recent lottery ticket.  I won $2.  Odds 1 in 75.  I haven&#8217;t won money from MegaMillions since I realized that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist :-P.  I think I&#8217;m on the right track.)</p>

					<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed A Little Weird (ALW) so far.  I like it better than PsiPog.net (my old paranormal website) for a variety of reasons.  I know that ALW doesn&#8217;t provide as much value to the audience compared to PsiPog.net, but I still feel I&#8217;m more on the &#8220;right path&#8221; with ALW than with PsiPog.net.</p>
<p>I want to add more features, but I&#8217;m having a hard time deciding what direction to move in.  I want to do something original.  I don&#8217;t want to add all the same generic website staples that exist in every community.  Forums are nice, but just plopping up some forums with no direction doesn&#8217;t feel right.  It&#8217;s too bland.</p>
<p>I want a <em>real</em> community.  I want everyone to feel as though they are truly a part of something.  I want members to take pride in the community, and feel a sense of ownership.</p>
<p>One idea that I keep returning to in my head is that disagreement is vital.  I want to attract people with drastically different beliefs and opinions.  On PsiPog.net, it felt like we kept trying to get everyone to agree on things.  When we failed, we got frustrated, and when we succeeded, things became boring.  I don&#8217;t like either outcome.  I think reality is far too enigmatic to be in agreement on how it functions.  I want every member to express themselves as individuals.  I want disagreement.</p>
<p>Not that I want members to fight with each other.  I simply want healthy and vibrant discussion.   I think we can disagree without being mean about it :-).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to focus on weird topics because there is so much to discuss.  With a focus on the bizarre nature of reality, there is so much unknown.  There are no definite answers.  I like that.  It allows the mind to really think freely and breeds intriguing ideas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to build this community.  It&#8217;s still foggy in my head.  I have a collection of ideas, but they aren&#8217;t connected yet into one game plan.  I&#8217;m also not sure how to guard against our natural drive to make others agree with ourselves.  It&#8217;s natural for a human to try and get people to agree with him/her.  I want people to express themselves, and have vibrant discussions, but I don&#8217;t want people to gravitate towards those they agree with.  If anything, I want the opposite.  I want members to gravitate towards people they adamantly disagree with.  I&#8217;m not sure how to create an environment for that to happen naturally.</p>
<p>I was about to fall asleep one night, when I came up with some ideals for this community in my head.  They went something like this:</p>
<p>1. Strength from Contrast</p>
<p>2. Unity through Diversity</p>
<p>3. Know Thyself, or maybe, Courageous Self-Expression</p>
<p>The first one means that contrast is what makes us strong.  Our strength, as a group, comes from our differences.  The second one means that we should embrace our diversity, and unite under the idea that we are different.  So many groups exist because the members have the same beliefs&#8230; I want the opposite of that.  I want a community that exists because we are all different.  The third one I have trouble putting into words, and I&#8217;ll probably change it.  But the idea is that we each need to be personally strong, and know who we are as individuals.  We need to stick up for what makes us who we are, and not be easily swayed by our insecurities.</p>
<p>These are all just ideas at this point.  Just floating around inside of my head (and now floating around on the internet :-P).  I&#8217;m curious if anyone has any further input.  I will be solidifying this idea over the next month or so, and once I get a clear vision, I&#8217;ll start moving towards it.  What do you think?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<h3>My First Weird Experience</h3>
<p>Before I became interested in psychic abilities (because I thought they were fake), I had a strong interest in hypnosis.  I was about 14 or 15 years old, and I saw a hypnotist on TV knocking people out and making them do weird things, like make out with brooms.  I was intrigued instantly.</p>
<p>As any nerd would do, my natural reaction was to go to the library and read every book on hypnosis I could find.  Unfortunately, there weren&#8217;t any.  There was only one in the catalog, and I had to order it from another library.  A tormenting week later, the book finally arrived, and I dove in.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t try hypnotizing anyone else&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really care about making other people look silly.  I wanted to try this stuff up close and personal.  The only chapter that interested me was the one titled, &#8220;Self-Hypnosis&#8221;.</p>
<p>I did the exercises, and they mostly didn&#8217;t do anything.  It put me in a light trance, but even then&#8230; it was more like - &#8220;Did I do it?  Was I hypnotized?  Or just messing with myself?&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t have any solid success.  I kept at it for a while (probably a month or two), but nothing crazy was happening, so I eventually lost interest.</p>
<p>Except for one experience&#8230; <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>At the time I didn&#8217;t make the connection, and concluded that self-hypnosis didn&#8217;t work for me.  Looking back, I now know that my experience was directly related to my practice with self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night, and was laying in bed.  The next thing I remember, I could hear people faintly.  The volume gradually increased until I could hear a crowd of people as if they were standing all around me.  I&#8217;m talking about actually <em>hearing</em> people.  If someone started a conversation with you in real life right now - that&#8217;s the exact kind of hearing I experienced.  Real hearing.  As if they were physically right next to me.</p>
<p>I could make out the voices and sounds.  It was as if I was walking down my hallway in high school, between classes.  I could hear some of my friends talking, and other acquaintances.  I could listen to the entire crowd and take in all the mur-murs, or I could focus in on one group of people and hear specifically what they were talking about.  Just like in real life.</p>
<p>I was absolutely amazed.  I was fully aware that I was laying in bed, in the middle of the night.  My eyes were even partly open.  I was completely calm and conscious.  But I heard voices :-P.  Perhaps I am crazy? <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  It wasn&#8217;t a dream, although part of my brain might have been in a dream state.  Eventually I fell asleep, after listening for about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<h3>Hypnagogia</h3>
<p>Before you actually think that I really am clinically crazy, I should tell you that my experience is somewhat common, and has been scientifically studied.  It&#8217;s called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia">hypnagogic</a> experience.  Weird word for a weird state of mind :-).</p>
<p>The scientific community claims that it&#8217;s a form of hallucination that people experience between the sleep and awake state.  There are a lot of different ways to experience this hallucination.  You can hear weird things (auditory), see weird things (visual), or feel weird things (tactile).  Or maybe a combination.  It just so happens that in my experience, I heard voices.</p>
<p>Since my experience, I&#8217;ve had a lot of hypnagogic hallucinations.  I can sometimes induce them on cue, but usually they just happen randomly.  Some hallucinations are very vivid and seem real, while others are very light and I can easily tell that it&#8217;s something in my head.  Either way, they are a lot of fun to play with, as long as you don&#8217;t get too freaked out :-).</p>
<h3>How to have a Hypnagogic Hallucination</h3>
<p>Chances are you&#8217;ve already had a light hypnagogic hallucination before, you just didn&#8217;t know what it was called.  I believe that day dreams are a very very light form of them (although I&#8217;ve never read research that has made the connection).  A more solid hypnagogic hallucination can be experienced before falling asleep at night.</p>
<p>How?  Simple: trance.</p>
<p>Trance out before you go to bed at night, and weird shit happens.  It&#8217;s a law of the universe :-).</p>
<p>But maybe this is your first time trying to induce a trance, and you have no real clue how to go about it.  Hey, don&#8217;t worry!  It just so happens I have some tips you can try :-).</p>
<p>First, lay down.  Close your eyes.  Sometimes I listen to music, and that can really help a lot.  What kind of music?  Surely you can guess by now: trance music :-).</p>
<p>If you choose to listen to some music, then a great way to get into a trance is to focus ONLY on the music.  Focus on every layer, every instrument, every background ting and whiz.  Make sure the songs are in stereo, and focus on how the left ear is slightly different from the right ear.  Put 100% of your focus in the song.  Forget your body.  Do this for about 20 minutes, and you&#8217;ll be in a nice trance :-).</p>
<p>If you choose not to listen to music, then you might have to work a little harder to trance out without falling asleep.  Progressive relaxation helps.  Basically, just lay there, don&#8217;t move your body, and relax all your muscles.  Then go muscle by muscle, and focus on making sure it&#8217;s completely relaxed.  Start at your feet, work your way up your legs, through your torso, down your arms, into your neck and face.  This entire process should take from 20 minutes to 40 minutes.  It&#8217;s not a race!  Take your time.</p>
<p>If you do progressive relaxation, and get to the end and you still aren&#8217;t tranced out, then just think of nothing.  Focus on thinking of nothing.  Keep doing that.  It&#8217;s hard.  But it works.</p>
<p>Once you get to a solid trance, either by using music, or relaxing your body, then just maintain the trance.  Weird stuff is bound to happen :-).</p>
<h3>What Happens?</h3>
<p>If you reach a trance state of mind, then you won&#8217;t be fully aware that you&#8217;re trancing out.  It&#8217;s like watching a really good movie.  It sucks you in and you completely forget that you&#8217;re sitting in a theater, watching a movie.  It&#8217;s like day dreaming.  If you try to pin down, &#8220;ok, NOW I&#8217;m day dreaming&#8221;, then you miss it.  But if you just let go and experience it, then you flow in and through it, and you realize afterwards what happened.</p>
<p>So what happens when you&#8217;re trancing out?  For me, usually something will yank me back.  Maybe I was trying to think of nothing, and a flood of thoughts rush into my mind.  Or I&#8217;ll hear something.  Or I&#8217;ll feel someone poke me :-P.  Hello hypnagogia!</p>
<p>Once a hallucination yanks me out of my trance, I don&#8217;t have to go back into a trance.  I can just lay there, stay calm, and play around with the hallucination - completely aware of what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>I experience hypnagogic states of mind about five times a month.  For example, last night I saw some weird stuff.  I went to bed, listening to some trance music.  I listened attentively for about 20 minutes, focusing only on the music, before I tranced out.  Then a flood of images and videos came at me.  It yanked me out of my trance, but the hallucination continued.  I saw faces and people - I was inspecting them and trying to memorize their faces.  This continued for about a minute.  The faces flashed by me quickly.  I didn&#8217;t recognize anyone :-P.  It was crystal clear though.  It wasn&#8217;t blurred, or fuzzy around the edges.  I saw it clearly.</p>
<p>Sometimes I experience auditory hallucination like I did during my first experience.  When I reach that state of mind, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m a radio, picking up whatever I want.  I can tune myself to music, and listen to songs in my head, with crystal clarity and perfect recall.  Or I can tune myself to specific people, and hear them talk.  For example, I may get yanked out of a trance hearing my friend say something (&#8221;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to just talk to him?  Maybe I just don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;).  I can tune in to that friend, and listen to them talk.  Or I can change to another person and listen to them.  Or change to music.  It&#8217;s fun :-).  And it&#8217;s all crystal clear, as if it was happening right in front of me.</p>
<p>In the same way, when I experience visual hallucination, sometimes I can tune it as well (but for me, tuning a visual hallucination is harder).  I remember one experience where I tuned into receiving cartoon characters.  Why?  Boredom I guess :-).  I tuned my hallucination to only show me cartoon characters.  I received a stream of different characters for a few minutes, changing about every second, like a slide show.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you want to experience something truly weird, then trance out before you go to bed at night.  Don&#8217;t have any expectations.  Just trance out.</p>
<p>If you can keep your cool, then you&#8217;re bound to experience some strange hallucinations.  It&#8217;s a lot of fun to play with.  It&#8217;s also amazing the first couple of times, because the hallucinations seem very real, and if you&#8217;ve never experienced a hallucination, it can be shocking to see how clear a hallucination can be.</p>
<p>If you do it a lot, you may figure out how to take slight control over a hallucination, and tune it in a certain direction.  It&#8217;s cool :-).  No drugs necessary.</p>
<p>Have fun!  If you have a question, feel free to ask in the comments.  Or if you&#8217;ve had a strange hallucination in the past, feel free to share as well :-).</p>

					<p>So what are my lottery results thus far?</p>
<p>I started the lottery project in March.  It&#8217;s now August.  I&#8217;ve played 40 MegaMillion tickets, and a bunch of scratch off tickets.  Of the $40 spent on MegaMillions, I&#8217;ve won $10 (from my 4th and 5th ticket purchased).  All others have been losers.  I&#8217;ve spent $77 on scratch off tickets, and won $113.  If you do the math, that means my entire project is showing a profit of $6.  At it&#8217;s peak, it was boasting around a $70 profit&#8230; but that has slowly dwindled down.</p>
<p>My interest in the project wavers in and out - just like any project that takes prolonged effort.  I&#8217;m glad I made the rule to stop playing when the jackpot is under $45 million.  This allows me to take some time off and think about other things, and then approach it with new effort when it&#8217;s in my range.</p>
<p>My biggest winnings have come from the scratch off tickets.  I think the reason for this is because it&#8217;s simply easier :-P.  The ticket is already winning before I purchase it, and I can hone in on winning tickets.  MegaMillions is an entirely different game.  I must either predict the correct numbers, or force my numbers to come up.  I perceive this as a harder game.  Whether or not the game itself is objectively &#8220;harder&#8221; is unknown&#8230; all I know is that from my perspective, it is harder.</p>
<p>It might make sense to play more scratch off tickets, since that&#8217;s where I have more &#8220;luck&#8221;.  That&#8217;s just not what I want to do though.  Scratch offs don&#8217;t pay as much, and they are harder to measure from a mathematical standpoint.  They also toy with your emotion :-P.  Of course, maybe that&#8217;s a good thing..?</p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important observation: I have no clue what direction to move in.  Intention manifestation had the most results with the scratch off, but it didn&#8217;t really help with MegaMillions.  The only winnings I had in MegaMillions happened the two drawings after I came to the realization that randomness doesn&#8217;t exist.  So maybe I should attempt to have more realizations?  I try, but either my new realizations aren&#8217;t correct, or don&#8217;t help :-P.  I haven&#8217;t won :-P.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to gauge my progress.  I don&#8217;t know how to tell whether I&#8217;m not I&#8217;m moving in the correct direction.  For example - if your goal is to learn to play guitar, then it&#8217;s pretty easy to gauge your progress.  Listen to yourself play - do your fingers move faster?  Does it sound nicer?  Then you&#8217;re doing good.  However, with the lottery, it&#8217;s a little more tricky.  The only gauge I have is whether I win or not.  If I don&#8217;t win, then I can&#8217;t tell if what I did the few days before actually helped or not.  Maybe I&#8217;m moving in the correct direction, but I&#8217;m not winning because I haven&#8217;t moved far enough along?  Or maybe I&#8217;m way off base have to turn around?  I simply don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong, randomness does exist, and I&#8217;m doing all this for nothing :-|.  Naaa! <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep trying.  It&#8217;s such a small investment that it would be silly to quit.  I literally pay for my tickets using a bucket of spare change.  So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going broke over it :-P.</p>
<p>I like the project because it&#8217;s challenging.  It&#8217;s a good goal, and it&#8217;s forcing me to move in all directions to find a solution.  I&#8217;m not sure if a solution actually exists&#8230; but I&#8217;m learning a lot along the way, and I have nothing better to do&#8230; so no harm done.  And it&#8217;s fun.  I&#8217;ve become a better person in the process as well - I&#8217;ve been exercising regularly, I&#8217;ve learned how to compose music, and I try to have patience with my roommate&#8217;s cats :-).  It might seem unrelated on the surface, but when I say I&#8217;m moving in &#8220;all directions&#8221;, I mean it :-P.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t won the jackpot yet, though.  If a solution does exist, then I will find it.</p>

					<p>Oh goodie :-).  A provoking topic.</p>
<p>Everyone takes jabs at religion.  It&#8217;s pretty easy to attack something people believe in, no matter what that belief is.  I encourage people to believe in things - even if your belief is incorrect (which it most likely is :-P), then at least you stood up for something.  That&#8217;s better than believing in nothing, and acting cynical.</p>
<p>However, I will now be hypocritical, and attack religion.  There are a lot of things about each religion that I disagree with, but there is one specific thing that I adamantly disagree with that exists in most religions.  It is the belief that their path is the only correct path.</p>
<p>To believe that your path is the only path that can lead to God or truth is ridiculous.  In fact, it <em>denies</em> God.  Each human is on their own path, and if you believe in God, then you believe that God put us on these paths.  To claim a path is &#8220;wrong&#8221; is to deny God&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>A sharp person will read the above paragraph and see how much of a hypocrite I really am.  If I&#8217;m preaching that no path is wrong, then how can I claim that religion is wrong?  I can&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ve just bitch-slapped myself.  Ow.</p>
<p>If there was one rule I could etch into the universal unconscious mind - one rule that people should just fucking follow no matter what - it would be this: No Killing.  Fuck love, fuck understanding, fuck compassion&#8230; let&#8217;s just focus on one thing.  No Killing.  Period.  Could we do that?  But I am a hypocrite.  The act of &#8220;etching rules&#8221; is in fact killing, in disguise.  Oh enigma!  That&#8217;s two bitch-slaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong&#8221;?  Who am I to say something is wrong anyways?  At best, I can tell others what I personally think is right&#8230; but even that doesn&#8217;t mean that it <em>is</em> right.  I&#8217;ve disagreed with myself more times than the community at large has.  I&#8217;ve change my beliefs and opinions so many times&#8230; when can I start preaching?  Where do I begin?  The second I start is the second I change my mind, and have to disprove what I&#8217;ve just proven.  Those that listen just inherit my struggles on top of their own.  Eek!</p>
<p>However, if I try to convey this observation to those that have yet to observe it, then I&#8217;m a victim of my own palm.  And if I do nothing, then my realizations are worthless.</p>
<p>Where is the illusion?  I&#8217;ve found it.</p>
<p>Truth cannot be conveyed.  Any attempts to teach truth to someone else is an immediate failure.  This sentence fails.  Truth can only be attained by the self.  No one else can attain it for us.</p>
<p>Is religion wrong?  Or does mind make it wrong?  If I can change my mind on what my favorite movie is, then can&#8217;t I change my religion as well?  Who is right?  The me that is religious, or the me that is anti-religious?  <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Bahaha :-).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There is a deeper meaning connecting all of our life events together.  Everything in our lives happens for a reason, and that reason is tied directly with our core being.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; I understand that when I start talking about &#8220;deep meaning&#8221;, that it sounds sort of spiritual and mystical&#8230; but please realize that I&#8217;ve come to this conclusion based on what I&#8217;ve seen.  It&#8217;s the only logical conclusion I can come to based on the evidence I&#8217;ve been presented with.  This isn&#8217;t a spiritual realization - this is an observation.  Everything <em>does</em> have meaning.</p>
<p>Reality is just like a dream.  When we dream, all these symbols and archetypes mesh together to form a strange experience.  We wake up, and we might brush it away&#8230; or we might look for the deeper meaning.  If I dream about building a tree house, this could mean that I&#8217;m trying to build an emotional sanctuary to escape to, in order to get away from my problems and feel at peace.  There&#8217;s meaning.  Reality is just like this.</p>
<p>For example, in my car I have two small <a href="http://www.unclesgames.com/images/products/big/071404350169_big.jpg" target="_blank">rubiks cubes</a> hanging from my rear view mirror.  The heat made the stickers curl and fall off - so now they are just blank cubes.  The rubiks cube represents difficult - but solvable - problems in my life.  The stickers falling off represents that I won&#8217;t solve these problems in a conventional sense.  I will solve the problems by transcending the rules of the game.  The stickers fell to the floor in my car, and made a mess.  This represents that by transcending the rules, I will create a mess as a result.  The stickers had been on the floor for weeks in my car, and yesterday I finally took the time to pick them up and throw them out.  This represents that I have finally cleaned up the resulting mess, and everything will work out.</p>
<p>Now - on the surface it just looks like I had some rubiks cubes in my car, the stickers fell off, and I didn&#8217;t clean it for a while.  Who cares.  But when you start treating things as if they have deeper meaning, then they start to actually have deeper meaning :-P.</p>
<p>You may argue that it&#8217;s my mind that&#8217;s creating this deeper meaning.  That reality is random, and I&#8217;m just seeing something that isn&#8217;t there.  You are correct - in a sense.  You are correct that my mind is creating this deeper meaning.  But the mistake is thinking that reality is random.</p>
<p>Reality is a mirror.  There is no better way to put it.  In fact, I was at the book store and I read a story highlighting this exact observation.  I picked up a &#8220;random&#8221; book, and started reading &#8220;random&#8221; pages, and &#8220;stumbled&#8221; upon the following story (which I will attempt to recall from memory):</p>
<p>A dog entered a room.  He spent some time in there, and upon leaving, he was gnarling, barking, growling, and overall just filled with anger.  Another dog entered the same room.  Upon leaving, he was happy, wagging his tail, with a huge smile on his face.  What was in the room?  It was a room of mirrors.  <strong><a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=puppy+mirror&amp;search=">THIS IS REALITY</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Some might argue that this is no big deal.  I mean&#8230; everything has meaning.  That&#8217;s great and everything, but ultimately -  so what?  That&#8217;s nothing new.  I disagree with this apathetic response.</p>
<p>This is a big deal.  The reason it&#8217;s a big deal is because it&#8217;s true :-P.  This isn&#8217;t some philosophical inquiry about how reality might function.  This isn&#8217;t some pot head drunk moment of clarity.  It might come to the same conclusion - but the path is very different.</p>
<p>This is observable - 100% of the time.  This is you reading this post.  This is me writing this post.  This is the keyboard under my fingertips.  This is the fan next to my monitor.  This is my roommate&#8217;s cats.  This is my car.  This is my relationships.  This is my mother and father.  This is my bed.  This is my job.  This is my body.  It&#8217;s a reflection of myself.  I am looking at myself.  And therefore, all I can see is deep meaning.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the practicality of this observation?  How does this realization actually help me?  How can I actually use it in real life?</p>
<p>Well, for one, I&#8217;m going to use it to win the lottery :-P.  I may go into the &#8220;how&#8221; in another post.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this realization helps me become a better person.  By looking around me, I see where I am.  Who I am.  And the small problems that spring up in my life are reflections of problems in my own mind.</p>
<p>For example - I went through a time period of playing chess a little while ago.  I bought chess books, studied chess, and tried to improve my chess skills.  Looking back, I see deep meaning associated with this.  I was attracted to chess for a lot of reasons, but one of the main ones was because I felt a lot of personal responsibility for where I was in my life.  Chess intrigued me because in chess - you make all your own moves.  No one forces you to move anywhere.  The only difference between me and a Grandmaster is how we move.  It&#8217;s not like poker, where we have to play the &#8220;cards were delt&#8221;.  It&#8217;s not like trivia, where our knowledge dictates our success.  It&#8217;s not football, where our physical strength is what counts.  In chess, it&#8217;s a simple game, where we have to combine our intuition with our calculating abilities to make simple moves that win.  That resonated with me.  It&#8217;s a reflection.</p>
<p>By studying chess, what I was really trying to do was study the laws of reality.  Figure out the game.  Use intuition and reason to win.</p>
<p>Now - how does this observation help me?  Well - let&#8217;s look at chess.  For one person to win, another has to lose.  As with most games.  If I felt a strong connection with chess, and knew that my interest in chess was a reflection of my desire to learn the laws of reality and &#8220;win&#8221;, then I can see a problem.  The problem is that in reality, I don&#8217;t have to make someone else lose for me to win.  Everyone can win in reality.  But if I feel that I must make someone else lose in order for me to win, then that uncovers an unhealthy belief that needs to be dealt with.  So - by seeing the interest I had in chess, I can quickly see that I need to inspect my beliefs about the duality of winning and losing, and figure out why I feel that I need to make others lose in order for me to win.  And once I root out the problem, I will stop resonating with chess, and become uninterested in it.  Which is what happened.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t play chess :-P.  Chess means different things to different people, at different times in their life.  When I was younger, I used to play chess a lot.  I played against a computer.  That probably had a completely different meaning at the time :-P.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined two examples in my life on how simple things have deeper meaning (rubiks cube, and chess).  I&#8217;ve made these observations in dozens, if not hundreds of things in my life in the past month.  I am amazed at how everything fits together seamlessly.  When we see one or two connections, things become curious.  But when we start to unravel the entire web of meaning, then it&#8217;s &#8230; simply amazing at how accurate of a mirror reality is.</p>
<p>By looking at our interests, we can predict problems that will arise in different areas of our life.  Why do we resonate with something?  Are there some unhealthy reasons for why we enjoy what we enjoy?  How will these unhealthy beliefs filter through to other areas of our lives and create discord?  If I can predict all of this, can I start to actually create a better reality by making small - and seemingly unrelated - decisions in my life?  Can I win the lottery by being nice to my roommate&#8217;s cat? <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> (or am I just insane?! :-P)</p>

					<p>Faith is tough.  Faith is something I struggle with.</p>
<p>Really, I believe there is only one application of faith.  Having faith that things will be ok.  Things will work out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how different root beliefs will filter their way through to behavior.  I had a friend who was very controlling and manipulative.  She was two-face, and always had to take control of a situation and make things turn out exactly how she wanted them to.  One day we were talking about things we struggle with, and she mentioned that she knew she was controlling, but she couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>
<p>I asked her: Do you believe in God?  The question really threw her off balance.  She started saying that she was raised Christian, and while she didn&#8217;t take religion too seriously, she was pretty sure she believed in God.  I told her that her controlling behavior could be a byproduct of not believing in God - that when someone believes in God, they have faith that things will work out on their own.  But without a belief in God, things don&#8217;t work out on their own unless you control the situation and make them work out for you.</p>
<p>She looked at me in shock, then walked away.  (<a href="2007/07/24/how-to-be-telepathic/index.html">Telepathy, anyone?</a>).</p>
<p>Without faith, we become controlling, or feel victimized.  With faith, we allow things to happen naturally, and we get through tough times knowing that everything will work out.  Faith is good.</p>
<p>I believe that modern religion has hijacked this idea of faith to include other things.  When someone doubts the Christian God, they are told to have more faith.  Faith shouldn&#8217;t be used to remove doubt about a subject.  If I start to doubt the existence of gravity, a scientist doesn&#8217;t tell me to have more faith.  If I doubt that President Bush is doing a good job, it&#8217;s not because I don&#8217;t have enough faith.  If you doubt something about Christianity, then explore the doubt.  Don&#8217;t bury it out of fear of not being &#8220;faithful&#8221;.</p>
<p>Faith in the future though&#8230; faith that things will work out and be ok.  That&#8217;s where the value is.  It stomps out fear and worry in a heartbeat.  It removes the desire to control everything.  It tells us that things happen for a reason.  It allows us to let go and move with time, instead of against it.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m going to give you the best method to become telepathic.  This is a big secret, so please don&#8217;t tell anyone :-P.</p>
<p>The ability to read someone else&#8217;s mind is the same ability as reading your own mind.  To read someone else&#8217;s mind, you need to simply read your own.</p>
<p>Now this might not make sense at first.  You might argue, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid, I&#8217;m thinking about things all the time, yet I can&#8217;t read anyone else&#8217;s mind.&#8221;  Well, there is a difference between &#8220;thinking&#8221; and &#8220;reading your own mind&#8221;.</p>
<p>We all think.  Thinking is easy.  To read your own mind, it&#8217;s a question of: what are you thinking about right now?  And <strong>why</strong>?</p>
<p>The degree to which you can answer those questions correctly is the degree to which you are consciously telepathic.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t discount this idea.  I know it might seem simple on the surface.  But it&#8217;s actually much more difficult than you might originally think.  What are you thinking about right now?  Have you ever looked?</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m thinking about 100,000 different things, all at once.  And so are you.  What we&#8217;re immediately aware of is just scratching the surface.  I&#8217;m thinking about my family, my job, females, food, money, the future, the past, my possessions, the time, my toe, this post&#8230; I&#8217;m planning, organizing, digging, covering up, learning, teaching, breathing, slouching.  In an instant.</p>
<p>This is what meditation is all about.  Or at least - one aspect of meditation.  Sit down and look inside your own head.  Look at what you&#8217;re thinking about.  Trace it back.  Why are you thinking about that?  What is it connected to?  What sparked your current train of thought?  And what sparked the spark?  Can you keep your mind quiet?  Can you stop all thought?  Probably not for long - so why not?  What thoughts arise to fill the void?</p>
<p>After doing this for a long time, you start to get a hang for how your mind works.  The surprising thing is that everyones mind is exactly the same.  The people you hate and the people you love are all using the same mind.  It&#8217;s the very mind that you use.  It&#8217;s my mind as well.</p>
<p>Practice this if telepathy interests you.  You&#8217;ll begin to see other people think inside your own mind.  You&#8217;ll see their eyes, and your thoughts will be their thoughts.  You&#8217;ll start seeing the future.  Not because you&#8217;re &#8220;psychic&#8221; or anything like that - simply because you are aware.</p>
<p>On the down side, reality can become boring when you know what&#8217;s going to happen.  It&#8217;s like watching a movie in slow motion.  Seeing a sentence form in someone&#8217;s mind, only to hear them start to speak it; waiting patiently for them to finish what you&#8217;ve already seen.  Doing something before you&#8217;re &#8220;suppose&#8221; to do it.  Throwing off the natural order of events, and confusing people.  Becoming offended by people&#8217;s thoughts, and them having no clue why you&#8217;re so pissed off at them.  Becoming annoyed before an annoying person starts to annoy you - and then becoming even more annoyed when they do exactly what you knew they were going to do :-P.</p>
<p>On the plus side, there is a lot less worry.  If something fails, you see it fail before it does&#8230; and you may see it succeed even further down the line.  While everyone else is coming to terms with the failure, you already see the solution manifesting in the future, so it&#8217;s easy to stay positive.  Now you just have to wait around for the present to catch up :-P.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jesse just e-mailed me the following news article: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19875410/site/newsweek/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19875410/site/newsweek/</a></p>
<p>Happy reading :-).</p>
