		<div id="post_10216" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Alright, here are some questions to discuss:<br />
<br />
What does an energy vampire drain?<br />
Psi? (Ki, Chi, etc)?<br />
Someone&#039;s Aura?<br />
ATP?<br />
Electrons?<br />
Another form of energy?<br />
<br />
If someone&#039;s psi energy is being drained, what effect could we assume that would have on the person? Would it have a physical affect, such as making someone tired? If so, then wouldn&#039;t that mean that psi energy is related to the ATP production that our bodies run off of?  Perhaps it has something to do with the ATP production in the brain? That could be tested for.<br />
<br />
I would say someone&#039;s aura is a possibility, however, an aura is supposed to be like light radiating from a lightbulb and we are the lightbulb.  When the light from a lightbulb is dim, we know the bulb is about to go out, however if we absorb that light into a glowstick, we aren&#039;t draining the lightbulb itself, we are using the energy the lightbulb has already emmitted.  That wouldn&#039;t be draining or &quot;vamping&quot; so much as it would be recycling.  If they do drain from auras, shouldn&#039;t we call them &quot;energy recyclers&quot;?<br />
<br />
A vampire (in a &quot;conventional&quot; sense) NEEDS to drain blood.  That&#039;s what makes it a vampire, right? So if we are using the term &quot;energy vampire&quot; wouldn&#039;t that mean the person NEEDS to drain some form of energy from a person? If you claim to be an energy vampire that can control who you drain from, etc, then you could definately test to see if you are an energy vampire right? How? Don&#039;t drain someone&#039;s energy and see what happens.<br />
<br />
Personally I&#039;m still convinced that energy vampires are just people that are exhausting to be around due to their absence of boundaries or some other factor about them, or that &quot;energy vampires&quot; is a scapegoat term used to take the responsibility off a person&#039;s own feeling of being socially drained when around people (introverts).  <br />
<br />
Another explanation is that energy vampires exist in the same form that &quot;bad luck&quot; exists.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still unconvinced of the existence of energy vampires.  I realize that several people believe in energy vampires and believe they are (or that other people are) energy vampires, but you guys are making HUGE claims about your &quot;abilities&quot; as energy vampires, which is a step up from believing in their existence and even claiming you are one.  I tried to avoid expressing my thoughts on this so I wouldn&#039;t sound like a flamer on this thread and burst some people&#039;s fantasy bubbles, however Sean is right, there is almost NO skepticism on this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akio: I find it interesting that you claim to be an energy vampire, however you question the existence of &quot;psi&quot; in other threads.  What else is an energy vampire draining? The bond energy found within ATP molecules, which fuels normal human functions? (Basically, electrons).</div>

		<div id="post_10218" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It&#039;s because of the method... the more close to my energy the thing I&#039;m draining from is, the easier it is to drain from... that is, if I am using the vampiric draining process...<br />
<br />
If I am using standard energy gathering as I do in meditation, I draw from everything around me and convert it to my energy. this takes longer but is safer.<br />
<br />
The Vampiric method requires that I drain through the venues in which one would use empathy and telepathy over, meaning that the energy is unchanged and unfiltered, making it faster but not as safe. This also means that the more the energy source and me are alike, the easier it is to drain from them...<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess there is no real reason you can&#039;t drain from plants using the vampiric method, but, from experience, you won&#039;t get a lot out of it. Using the Standard method, I can say that you already do drain from plants and animals ^_^...<br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
and for W, I could drain from you but it could risk an Awakening if you already have tendencies of a Psychic Vampire ^_^. I just thought about that, to be honest...<br />
<br />
The furthest I can tell you guys about an awakening is that if someone who is an unconscious Psy-Vamp gets drained by a conscience one, it is possible for the unconscious to become aware of his abilities that he already has. It&#039;s the Same process I went through a few years ago ^_^, but it&#039;s nothing really bad...</div>

		<div id="post_11008" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">There&#039;s not much more to say nonconformist. It&#039;s just a basic process in which an unconscious psi vamp may become a conscious one. It stems from the Idea that when ones energy goes under a certain level, they begin to reach into abilities in which they already had in order to balance the sudden shock of not having enough energy in the body.<br />
<br />
It works with a lot of people... I used to think that one had to be an unconscious vamp to transition to a conscious one, but I have come to rethink that after I talked more in the Psionic community.<br />
<br />
No, it can happen to anyone, the real idea is to &quot;Awake&quot; the ability in place in order to begin the process. There are some who may be born a Psi-vamp, although many times they take an awakening in order to bring them from the &quot;unconscious&quot; state. This state is the state in which a Psi-Vamp drains from people while unaware of what they&#039;re doing.<br />
When they become &quot;conscious&quot;, they begin to realize their full ability and begin to really feel their influence. <br />
<br />
Not much more can be said, but I hoped to have answered most of your questions..<br />
