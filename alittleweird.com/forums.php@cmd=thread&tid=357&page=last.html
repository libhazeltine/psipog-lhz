		<div id="post_8078" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Here&#039;s some tips from myself. I&#039;ve had problems with the same things, and I admit they are still persisting. My advice is to try NOT to put so much importance in not moving. If you do, moving your body will completely break your attempt and you won&#039;t care to try again. Instead, let your body move and just accept it as &#039;not being there yet&#039;.<br />
<br />
As for stop thinking. Have you ever noticed what it feels like to fall asleep? That suspended, &#039;not caring&#039; kind of feeling? There will be a point where you stop consciously thinking and just start perceiving. Try to get to that point. Also, try laying down as if you&#039;re going to sleep (choose a different position than usual if you feel like you will actually fall asleep otherwise) and try and pinpoint that moment and suspend it.</div>

i have only had an OBE one time so i cant really give you much advice but i can tell you this :<br />
<br />
when i try there is usually about a 50/50 chance i get that tingling feeling. it starts small at my feet and grows up to my knees. at that point it actually starts to HURT. whenever it gets to the point where it hurts i just back out and quit trying for that night.<br />
that is all i can reccommend.<br />
<br />
as for getting your body to fall asleep ill tell you my method. one i picked up from psipogs a while back :<br />
when trying to make your body fall asleep try running a dialogue through your mind. it should sound something like this :<br />
&quot;goodnight feet. thank you for doing so much work today and helping me walk around all day now it is time to go to bed&quot; <br />
in your head say something like that to each of your body parts from the feet up.<br />

<br />
If something in the middle of the night wakes you up, or you&#039;re just still tired once you wake up, go back to sleep.  Don&#039;t get up, just lie there.  You can move if you want.  Just tell your body when your going to sleep after you&#039;ve woken up, to have an OBE.  Just &#039;plan&#039; for it.  Then usually I&#039;ll find right before I fall asleep, I&#039;m in this weird state of mind where I&#039;m not &#039;fully&#039; awake yet I&#039;m 100% conscious.  Then I hear hallucinations, usually wind in my ear...  Then I&#039;ll find myself &#039;float&#039; out of my body...  =P<br />

Come to think of it, I haven&#039;t had one since March, I should do them again.  Since I haven&#039;t really had any success with anything else...</div>

1.Whenever I lay on my bed and let my body fall asleep, I would suddenly feel sharp itches on certain parts of my body. When I ignore this itches, I feel these itchy areas turn numb after some time. Does this usually occur while your body is falling asleep?<br />

2.Yesterday night I was trying for an OBE again. As usual my body felt heavy after some time. But after this I felt my whole body vibrating and I suddenly felt like as if the whole world around me swirling, just like I would usually feel when I was about to fall asleep. Then I swear that my right arm actually twitched without me telling it to. After that I had this feeling that my neck and shoulders were somehow &quot;pulled&quot; away from my body. My question is, is it normal for all these to occur when you have an OBE?</div>

When I get into a trance I can stop moving and most of my thoughts, but I always end up being aware of my breathing (having to breathe by yourself (Not automatic)). This is really annoying because when I stop all my thoughts I forget to breathe. I have had a tingling feeling before, it was on my face.<br />

No success right now, except for trancing for an hour.</div>
