I do however lurk every now and then waiting for a decent thread to arise.

The real world doesn&#039;t lend itself to being overly kind, so there&#039;s no point in getting upset over it. Also, we MUST do nothing. We SHOULD help those who are less fortunate when the opportunity arises, but it&#039;s not obligatory. The only two things you ever have to do in life is make choices and deal with the consequences. Anything beyond that is optional.<br />

Now, on the other hand, leaving because you&#039;re absolutely bored with the paranormal or message boards in general, or because you&#039;ve got too little time to drop in, is a good reason to leave.<br />

How is this a fluffy topic? The kid needs help. You can&#039;t just point at something and say it is fluffy unless you can absolutely say it is BS.[/quote]

I never said *this* was a fluffy topic. I said that fluffy topics in general shouldn&#039;t be tolerated.

Yes general respectfulness is a must, waking people up to the truth is good, but relentlessly being rude is not good. Remember this is a community here and we need to be kind to other people so that they still want to come here.[/quote]

I agree with you there. I think most disagreements regarding this comes from where you draw the line between needing to be kind and needing to wake someone up to the truth.

Paranormal discussion is to allow us to research, train, and share our experiences in order to get help, understanding, and finding the right road to the truth. As people with knowledge we must help others who are less fortunate, because if you were in a situation similar to Gaston would you want to get the help you need?[/quote]

I would want the help, but I wouldn&#039;t get upset if nobody wanted to help me. The real world doesn&#039;t lend itself to being overly kind, so there&#039;s no point in getting upset over it. Also, we MUST do nothing. We SHOULD help those who are less fortunate when the opportunity arises, but it&#039;s not obligatory. The only two things you ever have to do in life is make choices and deal with the consequences. Anything beyond that is optional.

Leaving because you feel like you cannot gain a greater understanding of the paranormal on the other hand is not childish, it is a sign that this forum is heading downhill. If you just feel like talking about the paranormal without any of the reasons in the above paragraph then the discussion is pointless.[/quote]

It&#039;s not pointless. I personally find a good conversation entertaining, even if nothing productive comes out of it. Most of the time, I could sit for hours with a friend talking about any random topic and accomplishing nothing. And yes, leaving is childish. So what if you didn&#039;t unlock the mysteries of the universe? Did you at least manage to pass the time? Now, on the other hand, leaving because you&#039;re absolutely bored with the paranormal or message boards in general, or because you&#039;ve got too little time to drop in, is a good reason to leave.

Today not all of the schools in America have typing courses in grade school to begin with. And who knows maybe certain sections of the world don&#039;t have typing courses as a mandatory course to begin with. Today most of the things that can make your life much simpler you have to teach yourself kind of like psionics.[/quote]

Having been to 5 different public schools while growing up, I would be surprised to see one that didn&#039;t require some form of keyboarding class. Even in the back-woods, 30-years behind-the-times area I live in, typing skills are useful (and a required part of the school&#039;s curriculum). But, even if his school doesn&#039;t require a typing class, I&#039;m willing to bet that they&#039;ll have students typing [i]something[/i] up at some point. And he&#039;ll definitely need the typing skills for college.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>
