next day I told him I dreamt with him and he agreed, he found out we dreamt the same thing, but he had that dream a long time before we both did, and that exactly that night he had it again but now with me in there<br />

so I think people can deffinitely connect telepathically through a dream, repeat dreams that already passed and be with someone elses consciousness while asleep<br />

		<div id="post_12518" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The weirdest thing happened to me. (I do not mean to sound girlishly) Last night I was thinking of telling a guy I invited to a school dance that I didn&#039;t want to go with him because I wanted to go with someone else. Not only that, But I am worried what my parents will think when they see him. (Seriously, not trying to talk about my guy problems.)<br />
<br />
Last night, I had a dream that it was the same day as the dance, and I was going with the guy I invited. I didn&#039;t have any doubts about him my family didn&#039;t seem to mind him.<br />
<br />
With that said, here is my question: Could your body subconsciously give a dream of what it wanted you to do? I mean, subconsciously, you really wanted to go with the guy you asked, but then you were having doubts. Could you (or your subconscious) subconscious make up a dream to make up your mind?</div>

The weirdest thing happened to me. (I do not mean to sound girlishly) Last night I was thinking of telling a guy I invited to a school dance that I didn&#039;t want to go with him because I wanted to go with someone else. Not only that, But I am worried what my parents will think when they see him. (Seriously, not trying to talk about my guy problems.)

Last night, I had a dream that it was the same day as the dance, and I was going with the guy I invited. I didn&#039;t have any doubts about him my family didn&#039;t seem to mind him.

I was kind of more worried about what they would think of him because I know some or the people I hang out with, they find really annoying and stupid, and half the time their right.<br />

The other half of that dream I was at cubscout camp (I staff there sometimes) and two of my friends were there, who I didn&#039;t expect to be there. I also went to the camp the same of the dance, but they&#039;re four hours away, driving time.<br />

It could have been looking into the future, but I&#039;m not sure.<br />
