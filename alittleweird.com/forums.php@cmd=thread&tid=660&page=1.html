One thing I&#039;m PRETTY sure I should learn before trying stuff is meditation, &#039;cause I know it helps.

The most important thing before starting any of this would be developing a schedule, why you want to practice psionics and what you expect to achieve from it, and meditation.<br />

I wouldn&#039;t think I was so basic at this if I hadn&#039;t had a friend who was really advanced. He was an online acquaintance, so it made it even more amazing to me.

		<div id="post_12691" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Corpse- That wouldn&#039;t work for me. My mother and father wake up at 3am to get ready for work. They&#039;re banging around the house until about 5. My brother&#039;s alarm starts going off around this time. It goes off two times after this (once each hour) until he gets up at 6. Sometimes he even gets up at five. Then he gets ready for school for one or two hours loudly-depending on what time he has to be there. His friend who lives with us gets up like twenty minutes before they leave. Then they go. They either get back at 10 or 12 or later depending on how long their day is. My mom gets home around 2, but sometimes later because she for some reason comes home really late sometimes. My dad gets home around 3 or 4. <br />
<br />
Sometimes my brother and his friend come home and sleep after they get off school. Sometimes they come home and just bang around til they have to go to work. If they don&#039;t, they either stick around the house or they go out. <br />
<br />
My mom goes up to her room around 6 or 7 to get ready for bed. My dad stays up later than that. Sometimes he goes to bed at 7 other times he stays up until 10. <br />
<br />
When my mom has a day off she stays up later til 10 or 12, then gets up early, around the time my brother and his friend leave for school. Her days off switch around, they used to be wednesdays and thursdays but now its random. <br />
<br />
My dad has weekends off and he&#039;ll stay up really late and get up really early. <br />
<br />
If my brother and his friend have no work and no school or no school and work etc they&#039;ll stay up late and party. They&#039;ll blast music or play their guitars or bring home girls who MUST be the chattiest ones they could ever find. They raid the kitchen nightly. <br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_12691">Corpse- That wouldn&#039;t work for me. My mother and father wake up at 3am to get ready for work. They&#039;re banging around the house until about 5. My brother&#039;s alarm starts going off around this time. It goes off two times after this (once each hour) until he gets up at 6. Sometimes he even gets up at five. Then he gets ready for school for one or two hours loudly-depending on what time he has to be there. His friend who lives with us gets up like twenty minutes before they leave. Then they go. They either get back at 10 or 12 or later depending on how long their day is. My mom gets home around 2, but sometimes later because she for some reason comes home really late sometimes. My dad gets home around 3 or 4. 

Sometimes my brother and his friend come home and sleep after they get off school. Sometimes they come home and just bang around til they have to go to work. If they don&#039;t, they either stick around the house or they go out. 

My mom goes up to her room around 6 or 7 to get ready for bed. My dad stays up later than that. Sometimes he goes to bed at 7 other times he stays up until 10. 

When my mom has a day off she stays up later til 10 or 12, then gets up early, around the time my brother and his friend leave for school. Her days off switch around, they used to be wednesdays and thursdays but now its random. 

My dad has weekends off and he&#039;ll stay up really late and get up really early.

<br />
Anyways, you wanted some personal experience?  Alright.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend thinking about what you want to do most.  Try what you want most first and see how well you are.  If you find something easier and/or more fun, you can do that.  Basically, the thinking of your priorities is a rough sketch that gets fine tuned when you actually go through with the things.<br />
<br />
While I wouldn&#039;t quite say it&#039;s absolutely necessary to start with Energy Manipulation, I did and I found later that it was the most enjoyable thing to do just for the sake of it, especially since I went after psionics mostly for telekinesis.  You shouldn&#039;t worry about being too skilled at EM.  Just go until you get a sense that you&#039;re good enough for you.  You, ultimately, are the judge.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t find it necessary to meditate to do stuff.  Never have, don&#039;t plan to, either.   I just go for it.  You should do what works best for <em>you</em>, meditating or not.<br />
<br />
To find time on when to do things, just find any moment that you can.  If you can make a whole practice schedule, that&#039;s fine.  I personally just find random moments throughout the day to just do what I can.  If I&#039;m waiting for something, I check out how the person over there is feeling.  If I can&#039;t sleep and I&#039;m bored, I move an impromptu psiwheel.  I do what I can.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I&#039;ve helped.  Nice to see new people around here :)</div>
