		<div id="post_7236" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Telling the difference comes from two things:<br />
<br />
1. Practice.  As you continue to practice, you can get a feel for it.<br />
<br />
2. (Probably more helpful...) You must learn to keep your mind quiet.  You must learn to be able to shut your mind up at will, for a good duration of time (30 seconds - 1 minute).  This is where meditation is helpful.  Keeping a blank mind for that long is challenging.  Once you can do that... THEN ask yourself a question, and keep your mind blank, waiting for a response.  If you get a feeling/thought, then you will have the experience of meditation to tell you whether it is your own mind rambling on, or if it&#039;s coming from an &quot;external&quot; source.<br />
<br />
To mountaingoats questions...<br />
<br />
My tip for you is not to put a lot of pressure on the situation.  It sounds like you might be expecting a lot, and then don&#039;t get anything amazing, so you become skeptical and quit.  Just have fun.  Be skeptical, but don&#039;t allow that skepticism to turn into cynicism.  Play around and just remain open.<br />
<br />
My subconscious has been a beneficial force in my life, for a lot of reasons.  One obvious way is that it&#039;s predicted a lot of things, which end up coming true - so it&#039;s very useful and eases stress when the future seems rocky.  It also gives me new things to try, that I probably wouldn&#039;t have thought of on my own.  It helps me remember things.<br />
<br />
Another benefit is that it allows me to think quickly... like having an internal conversation, using a combination of images, emotions, memories, words, movies, etc... all flowing quickly.  When communicating with people in the real world, we have to plan sentence structure, reference things that we all understand, and mostly just use words and some inflection or body language to communicate our point.  With my subconscious, I don&#039;t have to compose sentences - I can just think raw thoughts, and receive raw thoughts in return.  I don&#039;t have to explain anything - the explanation is embedded in the emotion itself.  In one thought, I can start off using words, switch to a memory, which has an embedded emotion, followed by a dream I had, back to words, and perhaps add a movie, with some still frames of importance - in a few seconds.  And get a reply in the same format.<br />
