seriously though, isnt this &quot;that requires to much energy&quot; just over analysing? its not like we have a maximum energy limit, most people what we believe/do is impossible, so why are we limiting what we do by saying it requires too much energy etc?</div>

		<div id="post_10412" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">What I&#039;m curious about is the physics behind light being spontaneously generated in air. I wonder if there are any other effects that could mimic it under &#039;normal&#039; conditions. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m curious as to if light is spontaneously created in the air by natural phenomena that perhaps we are overlooking. Not to say that it is the cause, but if we know what could cause it, perhaps we could understand a little bit better how psi interacts with nature.<br />
<br />
Ie. If a certain type of electromagnetic energy at a certain frequency or whatever it electromagnetism is rated at, can cause the same effect as a flared psiball, does the psiball appear visible by the same mechanism? And if, so is it because it&#039;s created by the electromagnetism, or if it interacts with something else to create that.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing is causing electrical interference with say... Cell phones or some other radio wave emitting object. If we can identify the things that cause interference, perhaps we can narrow it down to possibilities and explore the relationship between psi and those. Perhaps psi can emit radio waves if handled a certain way.<br />
<br />
If that&#039;s true then perhaps there is some equipment that is commercially available that would allow us to &quot;listen&quot; to psi. Something akin to how the Aurora Borealis can be listened to with the proper instruments, or how radio telescopes work.<br />
<br />
Speculation.</div>

Many insects and marine species do this. maybe it is the same concept. if u mix the theory of psi energy being a product of the nervouse system with a theory of human bioluminescence maybe that could... infarred webcam and take a picture of the psiball, if our visible spectrum can not pick that up, but many cameras can, then it is possible that useing a infared camera will show a fully formed construct...explain a flare.

<br />
They look like clear spark things like you can normally see very easily see on a cloudy day...<br />
<br />
The visibility of these objects are caused by the reflection of light on a background, which means that it is a physical object. Furthermore, it is clear, but distorting, so it is a small object, and it has no real depth, only size, which means it is close to or on the eye.<br />
<br />
The object you are speaking of is the dead skin falling off of your body (which happens frequently and regularly) that passes over your eye, it is also attributed to cells in the actual eye itself.<br />
<br />
simply put, these objects are reported so often as something like energy because of the circumstances of the eye itself.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
~ 300nm to ~1400nm are the wavelengths of the visible spectrum 300 is near UV, 1400 is near infrared. (these are wavelength measurements of the light themselves, I.e. 300nm equals 300 nanometers apart in the SI field of measurement.<br />
<br />
Infrared is labeled as follows:<br />
    * IR-A: 700 nm–1400 nm<br />
    * IR-B: 1400 nm–3000 nm<br />
    * IR-C: 3000 nm–1 mm<br />
<br />
most wood fires (which is much hotter than most psi-balls) is in the Ir-A spectrum, on the low end at that. It produces a little bit of light, but alot of heat.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m guessing the psi-ball is probably in the Ir-B to Ir-C Spectrum, meaning that we need to poor a lot more energy into a psi-ball to make it visible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In another note, if we were able to create photon particles, we may in fact create a visible light, but this to would require a lot more energy than our body has in it naturally. Our brain functions on very small amounts of energy.<br />
<br />

Really, the Idea is that if we are to excel in something of this manner we must not only forget our limits, but lose sight of the possible grandeur. Do you see what I&#039;m saying?<br />
