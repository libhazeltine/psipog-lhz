 And I don&#039;t think it gets much recognition as being valid outside of the guild and its members.</div>I agree, as I certainly don&#039;t hold it as a valid idea. These types of things complicate psionics too much. Over complication can sometimes lead to semantic squabbles, in this scenario at least. Psionics should stay simple, <em>simple</em> as that.<br />

The basic belief is, your psionic skills are inherited. Like everything else about you. Some people (most) didnt inherit anything special. So we&#039;d refer to them as &quot;nons&quot;. Some people inherit psi skills, and they would be called &quot;born ons&quot;. Some, inherit some, but a pretty small, not big amount. Right between a non and a born on. Those are &quot;partials&quot;. Now, people dont really fit into small little categories like this..Some people are born different ways, etc. But we just have those for the sake of trying to label. <br />
<br />
The birth switches dont really matter at all when learning psionics. Born ons just have a slight advantage in whatever they may have inherited. </div>

Now personally; I think this is complete garbage, seeing as how everything about psionics up until now was based in the mind, and not the body.<br />
Thats why my belief on the topic; is that these &quot;born ons&quot;  have nothing more genetically powerful about them in any way from a non.<br />
<br />
<br />
Psions have a different mindset about them, things that happen to them over the course of their lives change their views of the world and their feelings and actions based around those views.   That is the simplest and most likely way of explaining birthswitches as well.     <br />
You see,  out of all the things that have happened to you over the course of your life makes you completely different from anyone else,  what happened and how it effects you; build your own mindset.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up;  its my belief that people&#039;s psionic proficiency comes from the mind, not the body.<br />
The way people were raised, what they&#039;ve seen or done and how it effected them makes them better at different skills;  not biology.<br />

Yeah, it does... I think the physical signs seem really iffy too. Even though they say it isn&#039;t elitist, it sounds like it. But then again, some people rock at art naturally, some people suck their whole lives, some have to work on it. If psionics is like any other skill, I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s elitist at all. I think the specialties part is a little... odd, I guess, maybe not as rare as they say, but maybe it&#039;s like using different mediums in art... I can&#039;t really draw, but what I paint turns out good. If that makes sense :/</div>

I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s all in one&#039;s head, otherwise my family would be completely normal given what they believe.</div>You misunderstand,<br />
I was trying to say that people get interested in this stuff for some reason or another and because of it they change their perspectives, their &quot;mindsets&quot; on ideas and topics.<br />
You showing up here probably didn&#039;t  &quot;just happen&quot;..  and even if it did, staying wouldn&#039;t be a common thing unless this stuff interests you.  and it would interest you because somewhere along the line something happened that makes it interesting, right?<br />
<br />
If not, the only real reason you have left to stay here is because you have nothing better to do.  (no offense if thats the case)<br />
But.. it might actually not be the case, considering &quot;odd stuff&quot; seems to happen your parents, and probably yourself.<br />
<br />
Let me get back on track:<br />
A Psions mindset (like I was trying to say before),   is more geared towards the paranormal than someone who&#039;s not a psion,  &#039;odd stuff&#039; can happen to them both, although a person with a psion mindset will more than likely pay more attention to it than one with a non-psion mindset,  this focus is the key point in my argument, because when they know that they can see something or do something- given past experiences,  they will more than likely pick up on stuff other people wouldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />

I don&#039;t really agree with you, nothing amazing or even normal has pushed me towards psionics or developing what I have, it just happened. My family doesn&#039;t believe in psionics, not even a little, but odd stuff happens with them too. Nothing special in their lives either. I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s all in one&#039;s head, otherwise my family would be completely normal given what they believe.

You misunderstand,
I was trying to say that people get interested in this stuff for some reason or another and because of it they change their perspectives, their &quot;mindsets&quot; on ideas and topics.
You showing up here probably didn&#039;t  &quot;just happen&quot;..  and even if it did, staying wouldn&#039;t be a common thing unless this stuff interests you.  and it would interest you because somewhere along the line something happened that makes it interesting, right?

If not, the only real reason you have left to stay here is because you have nothing better to do.  (no offense if thats the case)
But.. it might actually not be the case, considering &quot;odd stuff&quot; seems to happen your parents, and probably yourself.

Let me get back on track:

Heres an example.<br />

We do this with the human body. Theres three types of bodies. (Its from genetics) <br />
<br />
Type 1: Ectomorph<br />
<br />
These people naturally have a bit of extra fat, along with muscle. They gain fat and muscle pretty easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Type 2: Mesomorph<br />
<br />
These people are natually muscular, and dont easily gain fat.<br />

Now, those are three types of people. And like birth switches, a lot of people dont fit into nice little categories. There is much variation. Some people are combination. And, what you DO also effects it. Just because your a natural psion doesn&#039;t mean you cant be surpassed by a trained one. Just because your a mesomorph doesn&#039;t mean you will be a better bodybuilder than a hardworking endomorph. </div>

Heres an example.

We do this with the human body. Theres three types of bodies. (Its from genetics) 

Type 1: Ectomorph

These people naturally have a bit of extra fat, along with muscle. They gain fat and muscle pretty easily.



Type 2: Mesomorph

These people are natually muscular, and dont easily gain fat.



Type 3: Endomorph

These people are naturally thin and skinny. They have trouble gaining fat and muscle.

But my point is that, accepting these classifications, we don&#039;t go around classifying people as mesomorphs or so on or so forth.<br />
<br />
Even if psionics are genetically influenced, why make such a huge deal of it?<br />
<br />
This is a little random, but I remember reading in ActitvePsy that Skywind had been actively using psychic skills since the age of 3.<br />
This corresponds with the &#039;Haute&#039;(haughty, maybe?) theory. However, she makes no mention of ever having any psychic family members, which surely would have come up at least once.<br />
I think that some people are just naturally more attuned.</div>

Imagine that you&#039;re a gifted telekinetic. You&#039;ve been practicing for years, but you still make it plainly evident that telekinesis runs in your genes. Even if it took you years of practice, you now have that &quot;special gene&quot; that a lot of people <em>don&#039;t</em> have. You have the telekinetic abilities to back up this claim, and so other people will believe you, and they&#039;ll think that they won&#039;t be as good at telekinesis because they don&#039;t have this gene.<br />
<br />
Basically, it&#039;s a way to explain certain people&#039;s inherent psionic abilities while making skilled people feel good about themselves and the poor psionics feel like they don&#039;t need to be (or shouldn&#039;t try to be) as good.</div>
