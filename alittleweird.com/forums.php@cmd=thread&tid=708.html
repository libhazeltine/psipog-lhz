Make sure when you practice you are away from stressful and/or annoying things(Brother,Sister,Parents,T.V.,Radios,Animals,etc.).<br />
When you encounter a distraction just push the thought gently away and return to your practice.</div>

		<div id="post_13398" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">What every psion needs to do before they even attempt psionics is practice their concentration first. This is why meditation is SO important! Without it, you won&#039;t even be able to do a drop of psionics (but that last part is my personal opinion, some may argue though)<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s what you do:<br />
1. Sit down comfortably but make sure you can&#039;t fall asleep in your position, also sit up straight, this helps from falling asleep and good posture is important. You will realize this when you are about 40 years old. I would recommend sitting in a chair. Add pillows/blankets if you wish.<br />
<br />
2. Choose a word that brings no images into your mind. The most common one is &quot;Om&quot; although most people just make up a word because they never hear it and has no meaning so it brings no images therefore calming down thoughts to a certain degree.<br />
<br />
3. Now just observe your thoughts. Every time you encounter a thought, say that word in your head to kill it. At first, you will find you have thoughts RUSHING in, this is completely normal. Within due time and practice your thoughts will calm down gradually and your subconscious will understand you wish to reduce your thought flow. In other words, every time you get a thought, don&#039;t analyze it. <br />
<br />
4. Once you get decent at this, you don&#039;t need to use the word, and you can just kill thoughts automatically. If you prefer this over using the word, then go right ahead. The word was just to make you more comfortable and easier to work with.<br />
<br />
5. Keep practicing until you analyze absolutely NO thoughts what so ever in at least five minutes. If you can do this, then you are ready to make a psi ball because now you should have the mental discipline to do so. This is also important for all the other psi skills, especially perception ones (like telepathy and scanning)<br />
<br />
Tip: Start off by practicing this only for 5 min 1-2 times a day. The reason why is because after a while your mind starts to get bored and thoughts increase and you get distracted easily. Increase the time by one minute every day until you feel you are comfortable with the time. You should do this because this is the easiest way for your mind to adjust to longer periods of practice time. This is also essentially important if you want to really get good with psionics. Practice makes the master. If you want, you can even increase it up to 5 hours a day, it really doesn&#039;t matter, as long as you feel you are comfortable with it.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, this may vary from person to person. Most seem to get it within about 1-2 months of practicing every day from what I have read. Good luck!</div>
