		<div id="post_10009" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Me was having a boring day, so I decided to google out: &quot;How to levitate&quot; just for some shits and gigles.<br />
<br />
I found out bunch of more or less BS pages full of people claiming abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, energy manipulation, and such.<br />
<br />
I read through hordes of pages, until one link from an unknown forum led me to a very intersting place. It had tons of articles, active community, and apparently critical yet accepting viewpoints towards the skills. I red the stuff. First came the famous pinwheel, after about two weeks, the bugger started to move after changing a sharper pin ^^. This road led me all the way to small cans and bottles. <br />
<br />
Psiballs however were something i was NOT willing to accept. In such a intelligent webresource, promoting such naive things seemed foolish, and almost convinced me that they were sham.<br />
<br />
I tried doing stuff for about two weeks without any real results. Until one evening I was sitting alone in my room, watching for a tv-show &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. I still remember the very episode, because I had been practising alot before it, and decided just to give it up and watch some tv.<br />
<br />
I held my hands the same way as did while making a psiball, but I was mostly interested on stuff that went on in television. I relaxed and kept watching the tv. Suddenly, I felt something VERY strong and tangible between my hands. At first I was certain there was something solid between them. Tingling, buzzing and cold sensations felt absolutely real. I spend some 10 minutes in awe of what I had just experienced. <br />
<br />
I realized that if a concept as absurd as psiball can be felt, then there must be at least some phenomenon behind most of the things claimed on the website.<br />
So I begun my studies from the resource we call : &quot;Psychic Students In Pursuit Of Guidanse&quot; or Psipog.<br />
<br />
Had the events taken a different course, had I not been bored on that particular day, My life would have been different.<br />
<br />
I sincerely feel privileged having been able to study and learn stuff, that a huge majority our people only daydream about! Although the effects I have met have always been modest, or even unimpressing, they still mean alot to me.<br />
<br />
After time passed, and the once magical things grew mundane, I lost the perspective on things. I began thinking that EVERYONE knows about this stuff, but just doesn&#039;t care.   So eventually I pretty much quit practising on a daily basis.<br />
Every once in a while I came back and noted that all the acquired skills come back rather easily. A day or two of intense rehearsing is enough to get back on the saddle.<br />
<br />
Now I am just drifting. Trying to seek motivation to really make a &quot;push&quot; for it. However, the amount of effort versus results gained just seems appalling.<br />
<br />
Eventually it has came donw to this question: &quot;Is it worth being able to do something incredibly amazing and feeling good about it, instead of using the time to please yourself on a short term quick-reward activities, such as computergames, internet stufing or tv watching&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nobody is guaranteeing the results. Should I really give it &quot;all I&#039;ve got&quot;?<br />
<br />
And just for a reference, the time-frame of my story is over 5 years long.<br />

when I was younger I did not have much access to the Internet, so as the young child that I was, I would try to move objects just by willing them to move. Sometimes when I felt the weather was horribly humid and hot(cause I live in Singapore which is a tropical country),I would try to will the weather to become cooler and clouds to gather above me. But then I wasn&#039;t successful in any of these attempts.<br />
<br />
After failing for so many times I started to lose interest in learning psionics. When I was 15 I took up tai chi lessons as my other interest besides psionics is the martial arts. During one of those lessons my master mentioned about &#039;chi&#039; being the same as &#039;psi&#039; which psychics have.(Webmaster Sean calls it energy in one of his PsiPog article). At that time, I had already trained for quite some time and I was already able to manipulate my energy. <br />
<br />
Google was already up at that time, so I googled the phrase &quot;developing psychic powers&quot;. I found this site: <a href="http://www.unexplainable.net," target="_blank">www.unexplainable.net,</a> by this guy called Jim McElwee( does anyone know him?). I put in my email for a free binaural beats sample and a few articles for learning psychic skills(&quot;mind tips&quot; as Jim puts it). That was in December last year.<br />
<br />
I first started with PsiBalls. With my energy manipulation skills I had no problems with making psiballs. Then came ESP, astral projection, lucd dreaming and recently, aura vision. When Jim sent his articles on ESP it actually came to mean clairvoyance and communicating with your subconscious, and astral projection is what we commonly know as OBE.<br />
<br />
The ESP practices weren&#039;t too bad cause I could perceive images from my subconscious about things that I wouldn&#039;t normally know, but OBE was damn tough. I never tried lucid dreaming and aura vision though.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t satisfied with just making psiballs though, so I googled &quot;psiball uses&quot;. I found two of the two sites which I would frequent quite often. One is PsiPog.net, the other is Psychic101.com. PsiPog contains all the good articles about the different psychic skills. The articles in psychic101.com are decent too, though honestly the grammar sucks. There are a few articles on chakra charging on psychic101.com by this fellow named Joseph R. Plazo, and one of it is about energising your third eye chakra to make you become clairvoyant.<br />
<br />
From chakra charging, I went on and googled &quot;chakra&quot;. There I found this site by Rick Richards, describing the chakra system and some exercises on develop the chakras( the link to this site is found in the thread &quot;developing ur chakras&quot;). So currently I&#039;m developing my chakras to strengthen my psychic powers and for personal development.</div>

Some memories and feelings are stored in our outer bodies, and we have a very big feeling about something, like I was pretty sure that my mom could telepathically read my mind when I was 5yrs old. Well she had other skills like precog etc. but I let her have &quot;rest in peace&quot; now. So, skills that we feel that are familiar to us, have been &quot;everyday life&quot; for us somewhen back then. Think about it with out skepticism and think why some things are already familiar to us, like meeting some random person on a street..<br />
<br />
My personal story about psionics is related to that foreword. I was pretty sure when I was 4-5yrs old that it&#039;s possible for humanbeing to fly (well, it&#039;s possible in AP and OBE, so I was somewhat right :)). When I was about 20 yrs old, I just were looking for some paranormal stuff and found psipog. I started with psiball, and succeeded in it in no time (first 5minutes). Later I started to practice my energy body and PK/TK etc. abilities. Those weren&#039;t that easily learnt, but after awhile I got the idea of them. OBE was my &quot;master goal&quot;, unfortenately I didn&#039;t have time to practice it more than just few times and succeeded only once in it. It did blow my mind, and all of the blocks I still had in my mind, just vanished. Last few years have been very interesting when all of these &quot;studies&quot; have started to find their own place in my &quot;Puzzle of (this) Life&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, if you have a feeling that you must do something in your life, just do it (if it isn&#039;t harmful for yourself, like jumping from a bridge), &#039;cause usually our path is guided already, and you&#039;ll end up just in time where you&#039;re supposed to be. That doesn&#039;t mean that you just have to wait for and everything sets up perfectly..</div>

		<div id="post_13926" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">This is a nice topic with many interesting stories. :) <br />
<br />
I think about 6 years ago I watched a movie with witches in it. I have no idea what it was called, but a new girl just moved into town and there were some other girls in her class who already practiced witchcraft and noticed that the new girl had natural talent. In class she would regularly do weird things like balance a pencil vertically on her finger. So, they got her into it and she became a really powerful witch. The end, haha. <br />
<br />
So, after watching this, I became interested in witchcraft. I did some research on it for a few days as a youngster pretty much reading and believing everything I saw. I came to the point where I wanted to read books about it. I asked my mom if she would buy me one of the books and she said no. That pretty much ended my interested in magic/witchcraft. <br />
<br />
It was a few days after being into magic and things when I had a dream. In the dream I had pretty awesome abilities such as levitation and very strong telekinesis. When I woke up, I was amazed and loved the feelings I had in the dream, I wanted to be able to use those abilities in real life as well. So, I started researching telekinesis. I basically came across a vast amount of fluffy sites and tried to learn from them. I eventually came across a site made by a young teenager who was also interested in the same field. He had many...fluffy things on there to be honest...but I e-mailed him because of my curiosity. He had grown up a bit since he made the site and wasn&#039;t as interested in the field. He then referred me to Psipog. That&#039;s when I started learning about Psionics. :) </div>

I think about 6 years ago I watched a movie with witches in it. I have no idea what it was called, but a new girl just moved into town and there were some other girls in her class who already practiced witchcraft and noticed that the new girl had natural talent. In class she would regularly do weird things like balance a pencil vertically on her finger. So, they got her into it and she became a really powerful witch. The end, haha. 

So, after watching this, I became interested in witchcraft. I did some research on it for a few days as a youngster pretty much reading and believing everything I saw. I came to the point where I wanted to read books about it. I asked my mom if she would buy me one of the books and she said no. That pretty much ended my interested in magic/witchcraft. 

It was a few days after being into magic and things when I had a dream. In the dream I had pretty awesome abilities such as levitation and very strong telekinesis. When I woke up, I was amazed and loved the feelings I had in the dream, I wanted to be able to use those abilities in real life as well. So, I started researching telekinesis.
