		<div id="post_15885" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hello guys...<br />
<br />
I agree that most psionic sites are dead anymore... years ago, I had a great job where I was on second shift and did nothing but data entry with all the overtime I wanted. I&#039;d do my contracts while I had a chat window opened on my computer from ppsociety.com (which was then telekinesis.mine.nu). Me, ErikJDurwoodII, TKCyrex, Fidex, Pecan, Martial Artist and a whole slew of others would be chatting for hours most everyday about the science of psi and how one brings it about. We did RV to each other over the chat room and everything.<br />
<br />
What had happened as time went on was that most of those guys were in high school and then went off to college (and thus dropped psi altogether), very few examples existed of true psi being displayed in videos - and then those who were apparently doing such (Not Important, Float, etc.) were the subject of skeptics explaining how these guys could have easily faked such videos. The science of psi was a rather unpopular topic amongst most of the psi goers and would rather have talked about spiritual enlightenment via new age philosophy... and so on and so on. Generalizing through my experience, this is what happened in the end.<br />
<br />
What we need to do to revitalize psi is to have a new chat room where we can demonstrate actual technical remote viewing right over the chat room to those who believe or disbelieve, discussions of the science of how this can work, actual remote PK over the chat room, etc. etc.</div>

I tried getting something together back in the June-August timeframe of exactly what you describe, but couldn&#039;t get it off the ground.  We need science, we need reliable/reproducible proof, we need documentation, we need equipment, experiments, etc.  But very few people actually believe we need this stuff.  Those of us that recognize this need have little free time, and hate spending the time we have on something the vast majority of people don&#039;t appreciate as worthwhile.<br />

<br />
<br />
#1 A chat room that&#039;s on Yahoo! (or one of those sites that lets you have free chatting online without bandwidth usage on your own website) where you can set up the name of the chat room, what it&#039;s about, who&#039;s invited, etc.<br />

#2 Scientific information from emails on psi from the following expert scientists:<br />

<br />
#3 Grillflame.net or PJ Gaener&#039;s connections to actual expert remote viewers who have no objections to visiting the chat room every now and then for RV demonstrations. They will thus serve as guinea pigs with technical remote viewing (e.g. I have TWO pictures of code number 1011/1819. Can the RVer detect both or will he/she see one only?)<br />
<br />
#4 The only equipment I can think of that comes close to generating actual psi energy is Wilhelm Reich&#039;s &quot;orgone generator&quot; items. Orgone has been compared to chi/prana/etc. and has anti-gravitational/metal softening properties from what I read. The Hutchison effect requires tesla coils, van de graaff generators, etc and that might be too expensive. <br />
<br />
Now you don&#039;t have to go along with EVERYTHING that I am suggesting - or even any of it. But it should give everyone an idea as to how each person can pick an idea and contribute based on what they favor where the stick to that idea alone. Get the picture?<br />

Giving a true scientific proof online is an impossible task and giving one in person would require alot of time and money. Since theres no government or millionaire backing us up, we can&#039;t do that.. yet.<br />
<br />
To experiment in a way that can proove things, we have to understand the nature of the skill and understand how our reality works.<br />
You know, at 13 I was already practicing out of body projections and then I stumbled upon telekinesis videos. I was telling myself woah fake! Then a few years later a friend did tk in front of me, just turning the psi wheel. I trusted him so I actively tried doing it, three days after I was successful!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m telling you this because the best proof one can get is from himself, what we need is to give them the sparkle for them to get their own.<br />
We have to find good ways for them to get their own proofs with no self-delusions.<br />
Any intelligent person takes online videos as either entertainement or a possibility, not a certainity. No matter who says what and who does what.<br />
<br />
Anyway, first we must establish ourselves.<br />
My time zone is [GMT -5, eastern). I cant promise teaching yet but I can promise posting and helping often.. You must understand I have a job and I&#039;m going to buy my own place, my own house! Plus I gotta learn vbnet and mysql then sell stuff to people as a side line :P<br />

		<div id="post_16185" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Near a month and a half too late for the bandwagon, but I thought I may pose a few words if for nothing but for old time&#039;s sake.<br />
<br />
I read through the first page, I skimmed through the outlines, I saw and rise of smiles amidst the smoke and ashes presumed to be seen. My words simply are this, do not give up so soon and stay stalwart to notions of your tomorrow.<br />
<br />
You may be wondering who I am, and more importantly what credentials or credibility I may even hold. I am an old face from PsiPog. Perhaps my name may ring a bell, my avatar which I have salvaged due to my incessant need to pack-rat things on my computer, or my old signature from the forums. Though who I am and if I can be considered an &quot;oldie&quot; or not is beyond the point and where I did or did not come from even more irrelevant. I did not return to flaunt who I was, yes was, because all things in due time do pass, no, I came for another reason, a reminder.<br />
<br />
We of the &quot;old&quot; are not all gone. Each and everyone of us came to the studies with our own purposes, drives, and ambitions and so did each one of us fall or disappear for reasons as numerous as what had brought us to them. But we are all not gone. <br />
<br />
PsiPog was a truly great community, I will not argue that, but we cannot ignore what it was. PsiPog was a gateway. It was a scientifically justified area for people such as ourselves to be convinced of our own outlandish dreams. To rationalize a world we may or may not have wanted to accept. To explore new possibilities or to answer old mysteries, it was there. When we got our answers we faded back to our own paths, but some stayed to help guide. You see these communities are but one step, the most basic step in a longer journey filled with so many choices and so many reasons to turn back. Feeling lonely is inevitable, feeling alone, and desperate... To wish for someone to be there to tell you it is not just a dream from a decaying psyche. <br />
<br />
Such is the nature of dreams though, they tantalize and entertain, they rise and they fall. Psionics and its pursuits are much like a dream, wondrous in their ability to captivate our imaginations and even more amazing is its ability to dwindle in our minds to an all too blurred memory of questionable merit for even a staunched and experienced novice. And why is this? It is because all things have a price. <br />
<br />
Technology has its cost in materials and the metaphysical, as you will come to find, has a whole other cost to it. This one-way path will never be easy and it will never be something you can rely on others for. We had the benefit of some minds who would dare and challenge the claims, to use their- our &quot;expertise&quot;, as loose as I use that term, to justify or debunk it. &quot;Fluff,&quot; a term not uncommon to we of old will always circulate and always must we take each claim with two pinches of salt and a hefty dose of rationality. So to end my late and overly worded post I merely want to say do not lose track of tomorrow lost in the sorrows of today and the dreams of yesterday. Times always change and you stand at the shore looking out at a vast ocean. An ocean whose current is not strong enough to push you down its body, but has enough vigor to keep you from turning back. The path to every answer you will ever need lays within you, be it moral or metaphysical. So now is your time to decide your own paths, to stay on the shore or to dare to cross an unforgiving and deceptive sea, alone.<br />
<br />
With that I wish your school plans the best, thank you for suffering through my long post,and extend my wish that your kismet may be kind.<br />

Though who I am and if I can be considered an &quot;oldie&quot; or not is beyond the point and where I did or did not come from even more irrelevant. I did not return to flaunt who I was, yes was, because all things in due time do pass, no, I came for another reason, a reminder.

We of the &quot;old&quot; are not all gone. Each and everyone of us came to the studies with our own purposes, drives, and ambitions and so did each one of us fall or disappear for reasons as numerous as what had brought us to them. But we are all not gone. 

PsiPog was a truly great community, I will not argue that, but we cannot ignore what it was. PsiPog was a gateway. It was a scientifically justified area for people such as ourselves to be convinced of our own outlandish dreams. To rationalize a world we may or may not have wanted to accept. To explore new possibilities or to answer old mysteries, it was there. When we got our answers we faded back to our own paths, but some stayed to help guide. You see these communities are but one step, the most basic step in a longer journey filled with so many choices and so many reasons to turn back. Feeling lonely is inevitable, feeling alone, and desperate... To wish for someone to be there to tell you it is not just a dream from a decaying psyche. 

Such is the nature of dreams though, they tantalize and entertain, they rise and they fall. Psionics and its pursuits are much like a dream, wondrous in their ability to captivate our imaginations and even more amazing is its ability to dwindle in our minds to an all too blurred memory of questionable merit for even a staunched and experienced novice. And why is this? It is because all things have a price. 

Technology has its cost in materials and the metaphysical, as you will come to find, has a whole other cost to it. This one-way path will never be easy and it will never be something you can rely on others for. We had the benefit of some minds who would dare and challenge the claims, to use their- our &quot;expertise&quot;, as loose as I use that term, to justify or debunk it. &quot;Fluff,&quot; a term not uncommon to we of old will always circulate and always must we take each claim with two pinches of salt and a hefty dose of rationality. So to end my late and overly worded post I merely want to say do not lose track of tomorrow lost in the sorrows of today and the dreams of yesterday. Times always change and you stand at the shore looking out at a vast ocean. An ocean whose current is not strong enough to push you down its body, but has enough vigor to keep you from turning back. The path to every answer you will ever need lays within you, be it moral or metaphysical. So now is your time to decide your own paths, to stay on the shore or to dare to cross an unforgiving and deceptive sea, alone.

With that I wish your school plans the best, thank you for suffering through my long post,and extend my wish that your kismet may be kind.

		<div id="post_16195" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Quite the picturesque description of the anomalous, ShadowWolf. Be there a manifesto, proclamation, or what have you, purveying resilience in the face of skeptic insolence and pomposity towards this rather corporeal enigma known as psi phenomenon, I elect that this be an archetype to those who seek such. Or perhaps I, albeit my own suspicions of the authenticity of countless psi expositions over internet mass communication, remain unaware of enough guile from magicians, hoaxsters and the like? Or do I grasp all too well my own acquaintance with anomalous phenomenon to the point where I boast in the face of audacious naysayers without remorse? One, as myself, may speculate indefinitely.     </div>
