Perhaps you are categorizing this experience wrong? I have been outside of my body with my mind many times, but not in the degree of an OBE.</div>

heres a description of the whole experience :<br />
<br />
i layed down and put on my headphones. i began to listen to the i-doser OBE dose (binaural brainwave stimulating music. helps to get into an OBE)<br />
<br />
i began the dose and within 5 minutes i went into a deep trance. i started to feel the vibrations and within another 5 minutes or so i started to get CEVs (closed eye visuals) my CEVs were mainly stuff like flashing lights and such.<br />
<br />
soon i felt myself start to float upwards out of my body why my body was not actually moving at all. <br />
i became aware of what was happening so i waited assuming that maybe i would get vision all around me but i never did. so to assure myself that i was in an OBE i tried to force myself to move forward. suddenly i began to float forward and i got to my door. when i went through the door i got the wierd feeling that is described most of the times when in an OBE.<br />
<br />
this whole time i could not see my surroundings but i sort of <em>knew</em> what was arround me just because of the surroundings that i were familliar with.<br />
<br />
besides. if it WAS an obe my golden teather probably wouldnt had let me gone past where i was fammilliar with.</div>

Or even better, when I open my &quot;eyes&quot;, my physical eyes open.  So I feel myself walking around my room, but I&#039;m looking out of my physical eyes!  Very cool :-).<br />

It took me a long time to figure out how to fix this.  Basically, I just had to calm down, and maintain my state until my vision eventually faded in.  In the past, when I got out of body, I would be so excited, and tried to run away from my physical body as fast as I could.  When I slow myself down, calm down, and relax, and focus just on calmly brining my vision into focus, then it slowly begins to work.  It usually takes a good 30 extra seconds to get my vision working now.<br />
<br />
As a last ditch effort, if it still isn&#039;t working after that, sometimes squinting worked for me.  I have no idea why.<br />
