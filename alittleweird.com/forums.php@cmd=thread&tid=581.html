		<div id="post_11645" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Here&#039;s one to wrap your head around: I think I&#039;ve figured out a few links between Quantum Science and Paranormal Phenomena. Feel free to tear apart and add to my ideas. These were too good to not share.<br />
<br />
Quantum Vacuum: The Nothingness and Everythingness. The quantum vacuum is made of all the possibilities that could ever exist. Light is both a wave and a particle, yes? What is it a wave in? The Quantum Vacuum. Everything is a wave in the Quantum Vacuum. A wave in the Quantum Vacuum separates what is from what isn&#039;t or what could be. An old name for the Quantum Vacuum might be Aether. An older one might be Quintessence.<br />
<br />
Information: Structure contains information. Entropy (aka. Randomness, aka. the Quantum Vacuum) contains no information. The waveform for any particular thing that exists is a structure defining that thing. Waveforms are information.<br />
<br />
Psi: Is it possible that Psi (aka. Chi, aka. Magic) is information? Psi creates and collapses waveforms in the Quantum Vacuum.<br />
<br />
Virtual Particles: Imaginary matter. Usually paired with a real particle, they can &quot;borrow&quot; energy from other particles to become temporarily real, and interact with real  matter and the real Universe. Is it possible that we know &quot;virtual particles&quot; as &quot;matter on the astral plane&quot;?<br />
<br />
Hawking Radiation: When Real Particles get sucked into a Black Hole, they leave behind energy that Virtual Particles take and use to become permanently Real. The newly Real Particles fly away from the Black Hole and are called &quot;Hawking Radiation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it possible that when they get to making that little black hole at CERN we could see a transfer of Imaginary (virtual) things from the astral plane into Real things, as Hawking Radiation?<br />
<br />
Quantum Reality: As quantum systems evolve, they throw out possibilities in every direction. I mean that literally. All possibilities exist at once until observed, at which point the waveform is collapsed into a single possibility. These possibilities are called Superpositions and there can be an infinite number of them, some even contradictory, but all happening at once. The coexistence of many, often contradictory, possible stated is a characteristic feature of quantum reality.<br />
<br />
The coolest part? Superpositions (possible reality) interact with Real Matter (observed reality), and often send shocks out both forward or backward in time. This means that Deja Vu, premonitions, and other Psychic observations about the future or the past have a grounding in Quantum Reality. <br />
<br />
They are actually remembrances of a past that hasn&#039;t happened yet because it&#039;s in the future.<br />
<br />
T.K.? Psi/Information altering and collapsing waveforms to move or have moved an object. It&#039;s also possible that this could be selective observation (observing an event in a manner to get the outcome you desire? Also quantum theory).<br />
<br />
Ghosts/Spirits/Servitors? Creatures made of Virtual Particles borrowing energy to interact with Reality.</div>

<br />
The logical relations between quantum terminology and psionic terminology make sense to me.  Quantum mechanics is a science of possibility and anything is possible within it, which is probably why psionic terms seem to fit so nice and snugly within its arms of logic.  I like your theory on TK being a selective observation of the desired possible outcome....if that was what you were getting at...and if it was then what would make an object have an outcome of movement if nothing acts upon it, or more simply put, how could Schrodinger&#039;s cat end up dead if there&#039;s nothing in the box to kill it?  If this is the case your previous statement about altering wave forms is more likely.<br />

Now I&#039;m rambling and probably only making sense to myself, but you have a reply so my work here is done.</div>

<br />
1st dimension: Width. Left to right and everything that exists from left to right. A line is a single dimensional object.<br />
<br />
2nd dimension: Height. Up and down in addition to left and right, a two-dimensional thing could be a drawing on a piece of paper.<br />
<br />
3rd dimension: Depth. The most famous of the multiple-dimensions. 3D. A statue is a good example of a 3 dimensional object.<br />
<br />
4th dimension: Time. A difficult to grasp dimension, this is the direction that events flow. It could theoretically be possible to travel the other direction in time, eb dlouw ti sa gnisufnoc sA, but my theory is that it would be like swimming against the current. Since when the big bang happened (according to a Hypothesis I have) it exploded in all dimensions, and sent everything moving forward in time, as well as outward from the center. A (somewhat) 4th dimensional object would be a 3-d movie, since it has the previous 3 and moves forward in the fourth.<br />
<br />
5th dimension: Possibility. This is the range of things that could have happened from then to now, or could happen from now till later. You could get up and get a drink, you could read a book, you certainly couldn&#039;t turn plaid or suddenly gain leftward momentum. This is the dimension of things that could happen based on conditions that have already happened. The possible things. A 5th dimensional object would be like a video game, since it flows forward in time, but allows choice.<br />
<br />
6th dimension: Impossibility.  This dimension measures all the things that happen, whether they could or not. Where the 5th dimension depended on your starting point, this dimension contains all of possibility and impossibility. I previously mentioned this as the Quantum Void. This is everything that could happen within conventional physics, and assuming the beginning of the universe was the beginning of the universe. Everthingness. In the Hitchhikers Guide, the Heart of Gold moves through the 6th dimension to a reality where you already were where you wanted to be. A 6th dimensional object would be a video game you were cheating at, teleporting around, gaining objects that don&#039;t exist, ect.<br />
<br />
7th &amp; 8th dimension: Infinite Impossibility. Like the 1st and 2nd are so often grouped together, so can be the 7th and 8th. The 7th and 8th dimension are all the possibilities that could arise from a different beginning of the universe, since the Big Bang, (sorta) decided all of our physics. The 7th and 8th dimensions contain possibilities that could arise through physics being different, and different starting conditions for the universe. Here is where suddenly turning plaid comes in, as well as breathing light and moving backward in time. An example would be a gaming system, instead of a single video game. Lots of stories and possibilities. Each has different rules, beginnings, endings and visual styles. Universes.<br />
<br />
9th: Travel in the 7th and 8th. Universal travel. Go meet Tenchi Masaki, or Cthulhu, or some weird thing that&#039;s never been imagined because the conditions for its existence are beyond our frame of reference. An example would be somone walking through an infinitely large arcade, looking at all the possible rules, beginnings and endings represented by all the games.<br />
