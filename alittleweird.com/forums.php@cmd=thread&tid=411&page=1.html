We are both very interested in it and practice apart, but would like to practice together. My question is what are some places where you could practice Psionics or PK in public? If we can&#039;t practice at home I suppose we must find somewhere else. I think that we all can agree that Psionic is much more fun when you have someone to study and practice with, but finding a location when your parents aren&#039;t thrilled by the same ideas as you can be difficult.<br />

If you don&#039;t feel bad about telling a white lie and you know that your parents will leave you alone for a while, one idea is to tell them that you are doing your homework / studying in your bedroom and then work on psionics... or you can just wait until they leave the house and practice then.<br />
<br />
Depending upon where you live, forests are sometimes calm and quiet places to practice  different aspects of psionics (though they aren&#039;t good for the psi-wheel because of wind).<br />
<br />
Mainly, you just have to get creative and figure out how to include psionics into your daily routine.<br />

		<div id="post_9107" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It depends on what you&#039;re trying to practice, really. If you&#039;re trying telepathy, then you can do it virtually anywhere quiet. No-one&#039;s going to question you both not really talking and trying to concentrate. But if you&#039;re doing psychokinesis, it&#039;s going to be hard to find anywhere that&#039;s quiet enough and has no possible outside influences that could ruin your experiments.<br />
<br />
One suggestion is to try and get someone *else* involved in psionics, and see if you can use their house. Possibly not the easiest way, but it could work. Otherwise, try and find a public place where you can meet and will not arouse suspicion particularly. I&#039;ve had a few practice sessions in the library (trying to do some work, getting bored, starting PK practice...), but it&#039;s hard if you can&#039;t find a secluded spot (luckily, my library is full of them). I mean, the worst that can happen is someone asks what you are doing. And then you can lie. If you chose your practice area right, people might not even walk by you. It&#039;s not like your average randomer is really going to know about psionics anyhow. =)</div>

I agree with Waldo, it really depend on the psion, for example. I try to manipulate wind with TK , so I do it in parks in the city. or when I&#039;m alone ( or making sure no-one will interupt me ) I work on the &quot;spining paper hanged from string&quot; excercise in my room. etc.<br />

		<div id="post_9112" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Well, I would say that we are mostly searching for a place to practice with psi wheel type stuff, things that make people wonder what in the world we are doing if we are seen. We have already found that the back of a bookstore works great for any kind of energy work or telepathy. As for a psi wheel though, that can be a bit stranger to see and even the quiet section in a bookstore isn&#039;t secluded enough.(I find it difficult to focus if we get interupted by people walking by and such.) Obviously we practice apart, but we think it would be beneficial to practice together as well. <br />
<br />
Some things you can do anywhere and get away with it other things, well, people are going to ask questions and we aren&#039;t aiming to get kicked out of bookstores for frightening customers. Some things are naturally more explainable. For example, I was looking for auras the other day and the person I was looking at asked what I was looking at. I just &quot;zoned out,&quot; that is an easy one.<br />
<br />
I guess my friend and I feel the same, he can answer this for himself if he wants, but not everyone has someone that lives 5 minutes away to practice with, we are very fortunate, why let it go to waste? We just exhausted our ideas of places to do it.<br />
<br />
Share some work? lol, I do the same things everyone else does, it is very cliche. Psi wheels, auras, OBE, a little play in telepathy, playing with energy in ones body, typical stuff. I am still very new to this, so I haven&#039;t gotten creative yet...I guess I will eventually. </div>

Falcon, I hear what you say about religion and psionics. Personally I have a very strong faith, my parents as well, we just see this differently.

I sometimes think that &quot;churched&quot; people can be very closed off to things, personally, I don&#039;t put God in a box, but a lot of times people dismiss things as not possible, when in fact, as we know, they are.<br />

And to react to your Faith and psionics (Although I am not Falcon ;))<br />
Religion can be something really irritating, because most people who believe do not want that their believe proves incorrect. Therefor, it cannot be that thing which are said not to be possible (or forbidden) according to the holy books AND/or the laws of physics (I see science as a beelieve in this contexst) are practiced or even possible. It is like when they discoverd that the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.<br />
<br />
My point is, if the things we can do are recognized as possible, their whole reality would fall appart. And you know that people don&#039;t like that. And most people who were &quot;trained&quot; to believe form an early age, are stuck in their believes.<br />
<br />
I said that science is a believe system in this context. I meant to say that most people just assume that science is right, especially if they cannot test it themselves. That is also the case with any other believe system. It cannot be verificated, thus you have to believe. And once you believe, it gets hard to think outside that box.</div>

The problem most of the time for my parents is this text in the Bible:<br />

I guess it means that I should not do things with strange rituals and such.<br />
However, if Psionics would also be included, I&#039;m doing something really wrong xD<br />
One more thing about this, the Bible is written thousand years ago, I don&#039;t know if their view on magic would suit our view on magic, or Psionics.<br />
