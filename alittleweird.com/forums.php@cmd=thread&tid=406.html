<br />
&quot;reality defines normality&quot;<br />

Almost any Buddhist would tell you that normality is only a relative term based off of duality that does not truly exist. That which happens happens: Nothing more, nothing less. Human judement can make occurences &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;weird&quot;. These judgements can also change overtime to change what is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;weird&quot;. <br />
<br />
Take, for example, the middle ages: Human equality in the european kingdoms was practially unheard of. False systems of hierarchy and &quot;noble/royal&quot; blood determined a person&#039;s perceived worth and class. Overtime those judgements changed and shifted towards egalitarianism (although we still have a long way to go sadly, as many of you must know). <br />
<br />
As the world stands right now, psionic and psychic phenomena is either considered a joke or considered weird or &quot;out there&quot; by the majority of the human population. On these forums, however, it is (or should be) considered potentially educational and more or less intriguing and &quot;normal&quot;. It only gets &quot;weird&quot; when someone brings up a topic of discussion the vast majority of the members is very doubtful of and/or has not been exposed to (enough).<br />

So true. The laws of the universe govern what is &quot;normal&quot;. It is funny that even many scientists themselves don&#039;t truly seem to grasp this simple concept; we often hear them express this by saying something like, &quot;It defies the laws of physics!&quot; <br />

Thank you Akio. By the way, (in case you don&#039;t already know) I have provided those examples about psychic reception in the &quot;powers&quot; thread. I understand that you are usually in a rush and that the thread bumping that has been going on would make that difficult to notice. Please respond in a thread in which I have posted recently when you have the time.</div>

<br />
I firmly believe that everyone has psionic abilities, most never know it, but as others have said before me, our society deems them to be...hmmm, what is the right word for it? How about we just say that it does not really promote these practices. Hollywood has had much fun ridiculing and wrongly portraying this, so really, is what society even knows about psionic abilities true? Why would they believe if they don&#039;t know?<br />
<br />
So really now, if everyone has the capability, it is normal. What the difference is is that we are aware of and accept psionics, while others, though capable, never even accept them as truth. That is what makes them see psionics as &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; or even &quot;weird.&quot;</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9091">Is there really a &quot;normal?&quot; I mean think about it, there is really no average, at least I don&#039;t think, everyone and everything is unique, there is no normal.

I firmly believe that everyone has psionic abilities, most never know it, but as others have said before me, our society deems them to be...hmmm, what is the right word for it? How about we just say that it does not really promote these practices.

		<div id="post_9179" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">&quot;Normal&quot; is the general, the average, the most common. Then there&#039;s a &quot;normality&quot; among things and psichic stuff is one of them. If we are talking about small &quot;insticts&quot; that everyone has everyday, then that&#039;s the normal, but if the case is moving stuff without touching it, then that&#039;s abnormal.<br />
I don&#039;t mind being &quot;abnormal&quot; if that&#039;s true, is like I often say <em>&quot;If it&#039;s true, let it be true&quot;</em>.</div>
