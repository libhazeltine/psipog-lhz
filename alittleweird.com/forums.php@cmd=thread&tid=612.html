For someone who knows what their doing, getting by shields is a fairly easy process. In reality it seems that a shield is at best just a filter. Of course, there are ways to make it more difficult (adding more shields, making more complicated shields, etc.). This is what I&#039;m here to cover.<br />

		<div id="post_12072" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Here is what I think are the flaws of the common shields based off what I think when I think of the image:<br />
<br />
Bubble - something to pop it with<br />
<br />
Diffuse - not a combat shield, but in the case I want the person to get electrocuted I would put more energy to attract electricity to it<br />
<br />
Mirror - smashing it with some sort of hammer/mallet/club<br />
<br />
Marshmellow - melting it away with fire<br />
<br />
Cloaking - some light or something that makes something stick out<br />
<br />
Force-bubble - popping it from the inside so it can explode out<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no way of knowing whether any of these are true, because this is something I sort of jotted down off the top of my head. I&#039;ll have to verify this stuff with my subconscious and this would need to be tested in some sparring, but now I am too tired and weak to do any of these things.<br />
<br />
I understand that people would be very skeptical about this, and it is to be expected...<br />
<br />
As far as I know no psionics website has any credible (if any) information on how to break through shields...<br />
<br />
But there has to be a way... </div>

Bubble - something to pop it with

Diffuse - not a combat shield, but in the case I want the person to get electrocuted I would put more energy to attract electricity to it

Mirror - smashing it with some sort of hammer/mallet/club

Marshmellow - melting it away with fire

Cloaking - some light or something that makes something stick out

Force-bubble - popping it from the inside so it can explode out


I have no way of knowing whether any of these are true, because this is something I sort of jotted down off the top of my head. I&#039;ll have to verify this stuff with my subconscious and this would need to be tested in some sparring, but now I am too tired and weak to do any of these things.

I understand that people would be very skeptical about this, and it is to be expected...

As far as I know no psionics website has any credible (if any) information on how to break through shields...

But there has to be a way...</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

What shield can impossibly be broken? Easy answered: One that doesn&#039;t exist.<br />
Let me explain what I mean with it:<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t defend against a psychic attack before you get attacked then nobody can break your defense, because you&#039;re, well defenseless. But that has not to be a bad thing. If your reflexes are good enough then you can block an attack instantly, just instantly as the attack comes: create a shield and keeping it until the attack is over. That way nobody can possibly defeat you if they are not stronger than you. Sure you might say &quot;How can my reflexes possibly be that good&quot;. There is a method where you slow the timeflow through autohypnosis (or selfhypnosis if you like) so you can act and react faster. It doesn&#039;t really slow the timeflow, but it feels like it.<br />
<br />
Another thing for this to work would be feeling your surroundings. If you can also see everything without using your eyes then I guess you are nearly invulnerable.</div>
