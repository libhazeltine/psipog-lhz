<br />
Supposedly Aramu Muru was an Inca Priest who did something with a golden disk (powerful artifact that was held in the Inca capitol) before passing through the doorway after the Spanish arrived.<br />
<br />
The Doorway itself is carved from solid rock and the local people tend to keep away from the area. Its said that people disappear through it and others have come through followed my glowing orbs of light. Jerry Wills runs a expedition company that offers guided trips to various places in peru and claims to have gone through the door.</div>

Wills is an interesting character though, he also does energy work for people and offers a list of courses in Shamanism. Though to become a master shaman you have to participate in both the trips he runs (Peruvian Amazon and Machu Picchu).<br />
<br />
Supposedly it was re-discovered by Jorge Luis Delgado.. but he also guides people around the area and wrote a book about it Andean Awakening. The book itself sounds interesting since it contains Inca mythology and local stories. I&#039;ll check it out sooner or later.</div>

<br />
The door itself isn&#039;t that large. its just a carving out of the rock face thats a foot or two deep and a bit shorter than most western doorways. Does apear to be another carving laying over the top that resembles someone laying down. Its located north of Chucuito, a town very near the lake, but i don&#039;t believe near the amazon since the lake is at such a high elevation. Aramu Muru&#039;s Doorway: <br />

Marcahuasi is known for a number of stone sculpture that the jury is kinda out on if a number are man made. One of them is said to look like a man that ages as the day goes on till he appears old at sunset from the shadows. Supposedly theres a lot of ufo activity here as well (but from what i&#039;ve read so far most inca places seem to make that claim).<br />

<br />
Also I believe the Inca actually had 3 creation stories.. but yes one speaks of life coming from the lake. <br />
<br />
If you type Chucuito, peru into google maps the name of the town actually appears a distance south east of where the pointer is.. not sure what thats about. As you zoom out you&#039;ll see El Collao then to the south west of even this Chucuito appears.<br />

Marcahuasi is pretty close to Lima(day of busing + a horse ride up the remainder the next morning).</div>

The doorway was something like the first chapter but wasn&#039;t a lot of info so it didn&#039;t really seem worth the money to buy it.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_7772">skimmed the opening of Andean Awakening. He talks a bit about his dream and a shaman&#039;s advice to seek the place out. He talks about different places he visited and tells a bit of mythology when the tangent arises. As far as the door itself he says he had what felt like a long vision while standing in it but doesn&#039;t know how long it really lasted.

was listening to C2C last night and linda moulten howe( <a href="http://www.earthfiles.com/" target="_blank">http://www.earthfiles.com/</a>) was on. she replayed an interview she did with a guy that said he traveled through this doorway. he talked about an alien encounter and also his experience in the doorway. talked about 3 tones used to activate the doorway, but didnt specify the tones. id love to know what they were or find out more about it. i imagine the interview is somewhere on her site, havent dug it up yet though.<br />
<br />
figured id throw this out there since there were others interested and this was the most detailed information id heard about it yet.</div>

The caller that initiates the discussion that brings up her &#039;William&#039; character using 3 tones mentions something that could be similar stateside. Supposedly someone named Ron Quinn writes about his experiences with a Stone Arch &#039;Time Portal&#039; near Arivaca, Arizona.

<br />
i actually came across your QC post about the topic and it basically had condensed the same info i had come across. interesting jerry would comment on it, but at least a sign that MAYBE he isnt actually isnt in it for the money.<br />
<br />
i watched some of their videos and read what i could about the doorway, but could find no other information other than what the interviewee had said about the 3 tones. i do not recall if the guy linda interviewed was actually jerry himself or someone else though.<br />
<br />
it would be quite interesting to know those tones though, for many reasons. i have never been to peru, but would LOVE to go, and if i did go id want to know the tones ahead of time, thats for sure.<br />
<br />
interesting side note: been reading a TON about ayahuasca due to it being a related topic. something that has been talked about on C2C before, but terribly interesting to do research on. if i make it to peru or the amazon area anytime soon, being able to participate in a shaman experience would be a nice consolation to passing through the doorway.</div>

Yeah I noticed parallels between what I was able to learn of Jerry and Howe&#039;s William (said the name was to protect the identity of the interviewee), but I can&#039;t say for sure either way.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think Ayahusca is necessarily any different from any other spiritual experience, but you can travel to a number of countries in south america and take it in a ceremonial style (some more theatrical than others), which you don&#039;t get access to in the US or Canada. There are plenty of shaman down there that don&#039;t use a psychedelic, so I would doubt its deeply involved with using the door. Ayahuasca users are kind of a specific specialization of shaman. <br />
<br />
I think the best bet would be talking to the people around the doorway in hopes of learning to use it. But it also sounded like you&#039;d need to have built up some kinda reputation before they&#039;d begin to discuss it.</div>

as far as the door, the reports ive heard are that locals tend to be afraid of it. i should imagine with a decent rapport you could get some information from them, but as far as usage and instruction id be curious to see if anyone had that knowledge or would be willing/interested in sharing it.<br />

none the less, a very intriguing subject. i actually work at a local HS down here and the spanish culture club takes trips to south and central america. they have been to machu picchu before (as far as i know) so if they plan another trip to peru anytime soon i might have to hitch a ride.</div>
