		<div id="post_13371" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I found a lot of people saying that recently. It&#039;s always in my mind that the existence of life is really a mistake, because there&#039;s no answer to it. consequently, life and death comes in parallel thus to balance out that mistake there is death. It still does not help, we see ourselves as existent because you can feel that you exist. I came to an idea that we all live in our separate worlds, where everyone else&#039;s fate are already sealed, but not your own. But that idea quickly disappeared, because indeed, it seemed everyone&#039;s lives are mixed together. The fact that we are alive and able to feel others who are alive means that they too, exist. At least, maybe,we already believe that. the origin f life will always be a myth...but everything that starts always have an end...The sun will eventually burn out, a baby&#039;s cry will end sometimes to a laughter. However, how would you think about in a hundred years, where you do not exist, like a rock next to a river, with the willows and the blowing wind... except you are not really a rock, you do not, exist. It does not seem likely, that after all a person go through in life, perhaps hundreds of murder done with malice, or thousands of good deeds that saved millions of people from suffering, end up the same. There is always balance, the suffer we cause to others, in balance, would come back to us, supposedly, since that way it would be fair. But how will that balance happen, the after life? But that would mean that you all exist as much as I do, and in a spiritual form, we are sort of equal, except one might possess more wisdom that others. That still makes us unequal though, that would not make sense as to what caused that imbalance, but if there is after life, it would be caused by the life before, and the first life we ever had...comes back the the question of our origin. Still, there had to be an end, logic shows everything ends, everything, life must be included. That end will either destroy the balance, or create a realm of imagination where, indeed, no one but our mind exists. <br />
<br />
Everything is part of mind, but they also indeed do exist, they may exist because our mind saying they exist, in this case, you are all imaginary, or everything exists because they truly exist, our mind is telling us the obvious truth. It would make a huge difference, for the first case, you can try to conqueror the world, and consequently succeed if you believe in it. But, all our beliefs are chained together, if your belief conflicts with my belief, they will cancel out, common sense wins. That would make the second case more plausible. It makes sense that when I try to fly and fail, it seemed that no one believed in that, perhaps not even myself. <br />

I personally don&#039;t think that your rubick&#039;s cube analogy works as well as you think it does. What if there was a close friend of yours and you found all sorts of patterns and applied them to your friend, to the point where you have ruled that this person must exist, and then the next day you find out from your doctor that your close friend is a hallucination induced by a government experiment?</div>

Scenario #1:<br />
The scientists care for humanity and how to best serve them.

<br />
Scenario #2:<br />
The scientists want to know how best to control people to meet their egocentric ideas, or their leader&#039;s (or leaders&#039;) if they have one. This starts to get tricky because there are many other scenarios that can come from this that it makes thinking about what I would do much more difficult. Here are a few:<br />
<br />
1. They tell me the truth.<br />
2. They lie to me.<br />
3. They know everything. (which can fit into #1 and #2)<br />
4. They can die. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not #5)<br />
5. They cannot die. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not # 4)<br />
6. There are natural laws and restrictions just like my &quot;world&quot; has natural laws and restrictions. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not #7)<br />
7. There are no natural laws and restrictions therefore making it possible to do anything. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not #6)<br />
8. They do not tell me anything, but I see or eventually see that their actions are against what is best for the entire human race. (which can fit into anything from #3-#7)<br />
9. They do not tell me anything, and I cannot see their actions in any way.<br />
<br />
Scenario #3:<br />
They do it just for the sake of gaining knowledge. I would ask a bunch of questions as to why they wanted that information in the first place. Please note from here on I will be talking about a situation where Scenario #1 and Scenario #2 do not exist, and they are basically like librarians (though both of them can exist under Scenario #3 from before this sentence). Upon finding that they are gathering knowledge like librarians purchase new books for a library, and they have no other ulterior motive, I would most likely help them or do things that I want to do for fun (like pottery). In the odd chance that I do not want to do either of these, I would probably do random things in order to break the monotony.<br />

So why do you ask?</div>

I don&#039;t know, it has to depend on why they are doing the experiment. I see three different scenarios as to why they would do such an experiment.

Scenario #1:
The scientists care for humanity and how to best serve them. In such a situation I would ask a lot of questions as to their findings, and initially have some doubt as to whether they truly care about humans. I would most likely, as I find out more about them and the situation of the world they live in, I would accept what they did and probably even endorse it because I think a unified human race that cares for one another is a good thing.

Scenario #2:
The scientists want to know how best to control people to meet their egocentric ideas, or their leader&#039;s (or leaders&#039;) if they have one. This starts to get tricky because there are many other scenarios that can come from this that it makes thinking about what I would do much more difficult. Here are a few:

1. They tell me the truth.
2. They lie to me.
3. They know everything. (which can fit into #1 and #2)
4. They can die. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not #5)
5. They cannot die. (which can fit into #1 and #2, but not # 4)
