		<div id="post_16481" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Once a long time ago during a Ouija board session, I asked the &quot;spirit&quot; or ghost, whatever it was, to give me a sign that it was really there. I had two candles lit (both identicle and fairly new), one on the right and the other on the left. I asked the ghost to blow out the one on the left. The left candle started flickering a lot and the wax started to melt down faster than the one on the right. I held my nose and mouth beforehand to make sure it wasn&#039;t me accidently breathing on it. The candle never blew out but it was halfway shorter than the one on the right from all the flickering and melting before I told it to stop only about 5 minutes in. <br />
I have a hard time believing in ghosts so I think maybe it was psychokinesis.     </div>

A year ago or so, when me and my father were among the few people in the store, I saw the shadow or reflection of a hand picking an apple from the back of the shelf (about 10 m away). It failed and the apple fell down from the shelf, onto the ground and rolled almost half a meter towards us. At first I thought that some shopkeeper was picking out stained apples and that we had startled them. But when I walked closer, I realized that in the back of the shelf there was a wall. It was weird - I was certain I had seen a hand coming out from there just a few moments ago..</div>

Actually a few weeks ago, I went over to a friends house that was apparently haunted. While trying to sleep, I had something fly at me (which could have been a bug). And then I felt something touch my head and felt something press up against the back of the chair I was laying in.<br />
<br />
Lets just say, I&#039;m a chicken, and sleep the entire night next to Rebecca, the girl who lived in the house.<br />

All of it could have been my imagination, but I guess I&#039;ll never know...<br />
