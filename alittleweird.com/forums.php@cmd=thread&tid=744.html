		<div id="post_13765" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Just about 5minutes ago I was thinking about this, because I think I have found my purpose and I wanted to know if anybody else already had the joy of finding his/her.<br />
<br />
I think my purpose is to be a protector and maybe a savior. I came to that conclusion, because I want to help the people around me and not just the passive way, but a more active way. I thought of starting with my family and friends. Actually the thought of helping them came before the thought of my purpose. Also since I was about 12 or so, I started to heal myself in a strange kind of way (I visualized may body as transparent white, created some sort of energy field around any part that hurted and pushed energy into that field. I only used it when something hurt, not when I was actually injured, but it worked usually within 1 or 2 minutes). <br />
After X-Master posted &quot;Quantum Touch&quot; I came to the idea to actually not only help myself and my parents, but also other people with this power.<br />
<br />
I already helped my dad with his leg. About 2 months ago his leg started to hurt when he walked too much (where too much was more than walking around in our flat). So I thought to use my self invented ability to help him. I concentrated for about 10 minutes. Since then he hasn&#039;t had any problems with this leg again.<br />
<br />
Enough about me, what about you? Has anyone of you already found their purpose in life?</div>

I&#039;ve been playing around with the healing too, though not with anyone else. I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s willing to give it a chance.

As I said, I already tried it out on my parents. That way I took the first step. The good thing about this technique is that all you have to do is touch the person which you want to heal.

I think you can convince people pretty easy with &quot;Since it cant harm, it can only help&quot;. So the only thing that they have to be willing is wasting some time.<br />

My next step will be to help my uncle. He has cancer and I think I can help him if I have the chance to try. The only problem is getting that chance. His wife/my aunt is that kind of person who doesn&#039;t want to here anything beyond what medicine and science says. Thats the major problem here. If anyone has an idea how to deal with it, I would be grateful to hear it.</div>
