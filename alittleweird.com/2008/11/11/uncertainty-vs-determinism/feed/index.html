		<description>I believe in a mix of both Determinism and Uncertainty. It is difficult to explain, and I am afraid that if I were to type it out it would appear as absolute jibberish (because it is one of those things I just know somehow).

In oppositione (of Sean's article) Determinism cannot be ruled out due to the fact we can never learn all of the formulas, because who says that we are not the only ones out there? Who knows maybe there is a deity out there that made all of the universe and knows everything? We are only a variable in a vast program. If Determinism does not exist than how come people can do precognition with fairly good results? I personally have done some precog recently and consider myself fairly accurate.

Also Sean don't you remember the Math.Random(); in Java? It takes the time and turns it into a random number, so if you could use it at the exact same time as another computer then you would get the same number. Could it be possible everything could be like Math.Random();?</description>

		<description>umm, how did that post relate to his attitude towards probability? Were you responding to the fact that he used god in a way that seems contradictory? He used the word interchangeably with a specific deity and with whatever driving force there was behind the system. So that's besides the point...

Also, the mathematics developed to explain the world dealt with volumes and probability since there's a large enough amount of atoms that the error gets rounded off. The word Dice in Einstein's quote refers quite literally to the nature of the math that was used to explain the system.

Uncertainty principle deals with really tiny things. What I determined from this is that our conscience isn't necessarily quantum and therefor free-willed, rather our conscience has to be quantum in order to be free willed.

subtle but important difference, fun post nonetheless.</description>

		<description>Then again, didn't the aging Einstein also claim something like: 

From: Albert Einstein
To: Eric Gutkind
Date: January 3, 1954 
Topic: Letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, 
"
The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.

		<description>I myself am a fan of Determinism. I actually came up with the theory myself before I knew someone else had come up with it, and it coincides perfectly with what you described it as. That is because I dislike Uncertainty. I think that everything works like Newton said, a clock that was set in motion by God. It follow rules.
Maybe scientists haven't discovered all the rules of quantum physics, and maybe there is a rule that is always applicable and changes things in a specific, but because we don't know it, we think that this randomness is a result of Uncertainty.

I agree. It really is hard to put Determinism up against Free Will, because it makes you sound less special. When you make your decisions, you might start thinking it doesn't matter because of determinism. So you might be giving up Free Will as you think that. The way I cope with it is just accept Determinism and try exerting as much Free Will, be it there or not, in my decisions.

About psi, maybe there is that quantum rule that just throws us off for now, making us think that there is that randomness, and maybe that is somehow responsible for psi and/or the consciousness.</description>
