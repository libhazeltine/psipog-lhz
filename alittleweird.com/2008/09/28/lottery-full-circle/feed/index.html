		<description>Ness, you're right, but I think most lotteries split the prize if there are multiple winners. So allowing others to win does diminish your winnings. If millions of people won, they'd get less than the cost of the ticket.</description>

		<description>Shantoruk, you make it sound like we're trying to manipulate the lottery. We're only trying to predict it.

In this case, we COULD all win. If all the psychics trying to predict the lottery did so correctly, they'd all win.</description>

		<description>My 2 cents:

Why do martial arts teach you to redirect the attackers energy? Because sometimes tackling things head on isn't the best way. No matter how strong you are, there's always someone stronger than you. But that doesn't mean you're always be defeated. Sometimes you just have to take a different path to victory. Even if sometimes the only way to beat someone is not to fight them.

The lottery is a zero sum game. No, it's worse than that, because the organizers &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; make a profit. Together the participants &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; lose have a net loss, although some might gain a little at the expense of others. So here's the catch - even assuming psychic powers exist, how many other psychics would be playing the lottery at the same time? Each one trying to bend it their way? They can't all win. And my suspicion is that their efforts would cancel each other out, unless one of them is orders of magnitude stronger than the rest. And how likely is that?

So what's the answer? To me it seems obvious: find a non zero-sum game. Life is full of them. Do something great and you have a net gain. Screw up badly and you'll have a net loss (example: the credit crisis right now). But at least in real life, on average, humans have been making a net gain. Compare our quality of life to someone a century ago.

Anyway, whatever you reason is for wanting to win the lottery, there may be a better way to achieve the goal behind that decision.

		<description>Maybe you should go and do a lot of good things... Or talk to a fortune teller. Yes future can be predicted, but jackpot is not the future. 

We should know that if there is a future, if we can see it, we know it can't be changed unless we see it and deliberately change it. Maybe jackpot isn't in your future, we should see through the future, and just keep working towards the "ultimate enlightenment" until we realize the true purpose of this world. I'm pretty sure that's not related to lottery, wealth, or power, it's beyond that.</description>
