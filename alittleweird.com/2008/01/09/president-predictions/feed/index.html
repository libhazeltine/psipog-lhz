		<description>Clinton. Mostly because people know she has experience. Obama has a great agenda, but unfortunately he just appears too inexperienced to citizens of the US of A.

I hope I'm wrong, but then again, I'd rather have Clinton than some reactionary republican ;) who has no clue about foreign policy.</description>

		<description>I have a gut feeling that all the candidates suck.  Before 2008 I had already been rooting for Ron Paul but it doesn't look like he's going anywhere in the elections.  If he's not on the ballot I probably won't vote.  I was actually predicting Juliani winning earlier this year, but now, I honestly don't know.

P.S. I hope Oipo is a divine deity that can see the future as clear as crystal.  I likey my chaos.</description>

"There’ll BE an election? I predict a period filled with chaos."

0.0 I hope you really suck at seeing the future.</description>

		<description>I think Obama will win the Dem primary because people just seem to like him more, he is more like Clinton's husband than she is.  I think he will chose her to be his running mate making it a black/female combo.  

Repubs I think will go with Guliani(sp?) b/c he will get the big states like NY, FL, Ca,ect in the primaries.  I think he is too libral and would need the evangelical Christian Huckabee to balance the ticket.

I think Obama/Clinton will win because the country wants and needs change.</description>

		<description>I can't say I follow polotics too much though I have enough knowledge to make an educated guess.. I would say Barack Obama. Reasons for my decision, well for one I don't think the republicans have a chance this year because america is sick of bush and ready for some major change. Two Hilary is a woman.. enough said there since it's not very "American" to have a woman in power. Three Edwards doesn't seem to be "out there" enough.. I didn't even know he was running until just this month. =P If you were to ask me which one I wanted running my country I would have to say neither. =)</description>

		<description>I don't think this can be used as a method to examine precognition. If personal judgement or personal knowledge over the probability of each event is involved, chances are that rational prediction will interfere with instinctive precognition and it could possibly interfere even on a subconscious level (like "even if I rationally predict X is going to win the elections I will just turn off my brain for a moment and listen to my guts" but fail anyway). In order to test precognition it'd (at least in my opinion) be better if one of us used homemade lottery extraction having eveyone predict the results. And yeah, I know I'm not good at English, I'm not American so have mercy =P.</description>

		<description>Hmm...

Obama gets the dem's nomination and chooses Howard Dean as a VP.

McCain gets the GOP's nomination and chooses Sam Brownback as VP.

McCain/Brownback wins November Election.</description>

		<description>The impression in the back of my mind - the best sort of impression - is that Obama will win the presidency.


Just to clarify though, I don't know anything about him or any other candidate. That's just the impression I get.</description>
