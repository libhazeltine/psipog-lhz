		<description>I have read that book before. It's interesting. The Akashic principle is a key piece of terminology to remember. 

I can recommend anything from Eliphas Levi... very interesting reading. 

If you want to get a taste for what people have investigated about the paranormal, what they have experienced, take a close, hard look at Hermetics and Levi's and Bardon's works. A good starter guide to hermetics is the Intitiation into Hermetics. These texts can be found below.

		<description>I've been having very vivid dreams the last few nights, in which I've intentionally been trying to lucid dream. On one occasion I actually got pretty good vibration results as a product of this. Still no OBE though.</description>

		<description>I'm attempting LD's too, and am glad to hear you've had success in that area at least...

Also, I like this codetank site! I'm apparently already a "Power User"...this is awesome. ;&#62;_&#62;</description>
