		<description>you know, im not exactly sure how to do it, and ill look if you want, but im pretty sure you can capture footage directly to your computer, and that would allow you to film for quite a while if you have a few gigs on your drive open</description>

		<description>I think that WBTB is actually one of the easiest and most effective techniques for lucid dreams or OBEs. It does however, take a lot more dedication because you do tend to end up tired afterwards.

		<description>Awsome! it would be amazing to catch any visual effects of an OBE on camera. I just hope it's capable of recording it in some way, maybe you can flare up your OBE body like a psiball?</description>

		<description>Neo - Actually, WBTB was the method I used to achieve my first OBE.  It was called the "SunEye" method back then :-P.  I've had good success with it, overall.</description>

		<description>Ouch, that would really suck. I think that the Wake-back-to-bed method is one of the hardest to try to OBE or lucid dream from. Mainly because of waking up in the middle of the night. I would try it but I'm afraid I would be very sleepy the next day.

Good luck on trying to get that video &#62;.</description>
