		<description>Possibly, Why don't you try asking it why. I am going to do the same because I don't understand why I wouldn't be ready for detachment if not for it being dangerous in some way.. Or maybe someone wholds a grudge against me and is waiting for an oppertunity for a psychic attack? I don't know.</description>

		<description>Tiger, it's nice to know that I am not the only one who experienced the subconscience interference with trying to have and OBE. Maybe I could use this to communicate better with it?</description>

		<description>That's very interesting Emerald because my subconscience has told me several times that I wasn't ready for full detachment.. I usually ignore him and continue trying anywyas though. =P With little results.  Anyways one solution to the camera issue is to get a better camera, and maybe one with either infrared or some type of nightvision..</description>

		<description>@ Sean

Red light does not leave spots on your eyes if you see it. People use it for lamps if they're stargazing and such. It is quite easy to fall asleep with at nighttime.

		<description>Hey Sean, I was just practicing for an OBE last night when my dog barked all of a sudden. That ruined pretty much everything I had worked for, but before that happened, it felt like my physical body was a bit detached from my awareness/conscience and that I was just anchored to a point. It felt cool, but it also gave me an idea. Maybe if you have any sort of stimuli in your house or wherever you are trying to have your OBE, then maybe you should try to 'eliminate the variables'? I also faintly heard a voice(subconscience?) say 'not now' or 'not ready'. Just a thought.

		<description>Hey Sean can you recommend any good songs to trance out to? I have five or six that work well for me but I have trouble finding any more. It gets harder to trance to songs I'm pretty familiar with too :/ A few good ones I have are Suburban Train - DJ Tiesto and Gouryella - Gouryella. Any recs would be appreciated, Thanks :)</description>

		<description>Just like Jspapp says above, I would recommend just using a webcam and compressing the video. Infrared might work - just make your camera view infrared and install a bunch of high-powered infrared LEDs. You can't see the light, but the camera can.</description>

		<description>Does your camera have night-vision?

And about only recording for an hour, is it possible that you could hook the camera up to your computer, and just record to your harddrive?</description>

		<description>I think you're thinking about developing photos... could you sleep in red light? :-P  I think I'd be more comfortable with plain old white light.  I was thinking about using sunlight, but trying early in the morning.</description>
