			<div class="entry">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been training in OBEs lately, and I think I just had an OBE last night.</p>
<p>The technique I used was to sleep for 3 hours (around 5:30pm to 8:30pm), wake up, and then go back to sleep around 1:00am.  I&#8217;ve done this the past couple nights.  Upon going to sleep the second time, I will listen to music in order to trance out.  After trancing out for a good 30-40 minutes, I&#8217;ll remove my headphones, and go to sleep.</p>
<p>If I had an OBE, and it wasn&#8217;t just a dream, then this marks a significant milestone - I haven&#8217;t had an OBE during the night time in what feels like years.  Almost all of my OBEs occur during the transition from sleeping -&gt; wake.  It takes a lot of training for me to accomplish an OBE from the wake -&gt; sleep transition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning to better control them, and make them longer.  I&#8217;ve finally figured out the key to a long and clear OBE: remaining passive!  HA!  I always thought that I <em>was</em> passive, but I&#8217;ve realized that in the past, I was never passive enough.  In the past, when I had an OBE, I would try to be passive, but also have strong motivation to explore and take advantage of the OBE.  Now, I have removed these underlying motives, and have a true passive feel - I don&#8217;t care if the OBE lasts a minute, or 30 minutes, and I don&#8217;t try to force myself to experience anything.  If my OBE consists of floating immediately outside of my body for a few seconds, then so be it.</p>
<p>The downside to having an OBE on the wake -&gt; sleep transition is that I had a couple hours worth of dreams after it.  So my memory of the OBE is extremely foggy.  I remember leaving, remaining passive, floating around in my apartment, and looking at my hands.  I remember playing with my breathing, and being confused whether my breathing pattern was actually being used by my body - or if it was just inside my head.  I had lost my connection to my body, so I was unsure if what I was doing was affecting my body at all, or if I was just floating around, pretending to breathe.  I&#8217;ll have to attempt to remember more.</p>
<p>Fun fun!</p>
<p>EDIT: I wanted to add a few more comments, just for the sake of having it documented.  After thinking and remembering the experience, I am now positive that it was an OBE and not a dream.  Specifically, I remember trancing out, and &#8220;swinging&#8221; my awareness around in circles, around my body.  I also was playing with shifting my awareness to the left, which made me feel like my lungs where breathing to my far right (instead of below me).  I remembering thinking at the time, &#8220;Oh cool, I&#8217;m probably going to have an OBE, because usually when I can get my awareness to fudge around like this, it means that I&#8217;m close.&#8221;  I may post more on this technique in a future entry&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT II: Another one!  Two nights in a row :-).  My technique was nearly the same - sleep early for a long time, wake up for a few hours, and then go back to bed.  This time around, I didn&#8217;t listen to trance music as I fell asleep the second time.  I just went to bed, and tossed for an hour or two restlessly.</p>
<p>The OBE consisted of falling through the floor at rapid speed, after which I said, &#8220;That was cool, let&#8217;s do it again!&#8221;.  After that, I stumbled around without vision for a few minutes, feeling my way around my room.  I returned to my body, and had a creepy feeling that there was another &#8220;presence&#8221; in the room with me (though it could have easily been my mind playing tricks on me).  I played around for a few minutes longer, then fell asleep for good.</p>
<p>W commented, asking if I got a video of my first OBE.  This made me think about how to video tape my second one.  I didn&#8217;t attempt to video tape my second one for two reasons: 1. my room is dark.  It&#8217;s night time, and it&#8217;s pitch black.  2. my OBEs take a long time to prepare for - I was tossing and turning for about an hour and a half before I began to trance slightly, and then it probably took another half hour to trance.  My video camera can only record for an hour, maximum.  I will have to see if I can think of some solutions to these two problems.</p>

			<p>I have been trying to induce OBE&#8217;s my messing with my sleep schedule for the past 6 days now and all that has come of it is 100% dream recall.. That sucks that it&#8217;s more easily induced through lucid dreams because I have only had two lucid dreams my entire life. =P Oh what to do..</p>

			<p>I think you&#8217;re thinking about developing photos&#8230; could you sleep in red light? <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' />  I think I&#8217;d be more comfortable with plain old white light.  I was thinking about using sunlight, but trying early in the morning.</p>

			<p>Does your camera have night-vision?</p>
<p>And about only recording for an hour, is it possible that you could hook the camera up to your computer, and just record to your harddrive?</p>

			<p>Just like Jspapp says above, I would recommend just using a webcam and compressing the video. Infrared might work - just make your camera view infrared and install a bunch of high-powered infrared LEDs. You can&#8217;t see the light, but the camera can.</p>

			<p>Hey Sean can you recommend any good songs to trance out to? I have five or six that work well for me but I have trouble finding any more. It gets harder to trance to songs I&#8217;m pretty familiar with too :/ A few good ones I have are Suburban Train - DJ Tiesto and Gouryella - Gouryella. Any recs would be appreciated, Thanks <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>Hey Sean, I was just practicing for an OBE last night when my dog barked all of a sudden. That ruined pretty much everything I had worked for, but before that happened, it felt like my physical body was a bit detached from my awareness/conscience and that I was just anchored to a point. It felt cool, but it also gave me an idea. Maybe if you have any sort of stimuli in your house or wherever you are trying to have your OBE, then maybe you should try to &#8216;eliminate the variables&#8217;? I also faintly heard a voice(subconscience?) say &#8216;not now&#8217; or &#8216;not ready&#8217;. Just a thought.</p>

			<p>@ Sean</p>
<p>Red light does not leave spots on your eyes if you see it. People use it for lamps if they&#8217;re stargazing and such. It is quite easy to fall asleep with at nighttime.</p>

			<p>That&#8217;s very interesting Emerald because my subconscience has told me several times that I wasn&#8217;t ready for full detachment.. I usually ignore him and continue trying anywyas though. =P With little results.  Anyways one solution to the camera issue is to get a better camera, and maybe one with either infrared or some type of nightvision..</p>

			<p>Tiger, it&#8217;s nice to know that I am not the only one who experienced the subconscience interference with trying to have and OBE. Maybe I could use this to communicate better with it?</p>

			<p>Possibly, Why don&#8217;t you try asking it why. I am going to do the same because I don&#8217;t understand why I wouldn&#8217;t be ready for detachment if not for it being dangerous in some way.. Or maybe someone wholds a grudge against me and is waiting for an oppertunity for a psychic attack? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
