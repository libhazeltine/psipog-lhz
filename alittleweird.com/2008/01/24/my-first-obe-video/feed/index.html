		<description>As I've said to him before, an OBE is simply a mental effect. It has no physical manifestation beyond your body being asleep. 

For a very interesting historical example, you can read the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage (A grimoire written in the 1400's). A woman gave Abramelin a jar of lotion on one of his travels; when rubbed on his feet and the palms of his hands, he went into a sleeping state where he thought (and indeed initially believed) he could fly through the air.

He visited a friend of his back in his home city.... and saw him undertaking a profession that was completely not what he expected to see him doing, what Abramelin knew he should be doing (Sound familiar, Sean? An old story of an OBE on Psipog, I think).

Because of this, he realized that the experience of "flying" was not connected to reality, and confronted the woman who would come to admit that it was a drug.

When I first read this, I immediately connected it to OBE's. In my understanding, this effect is metnal... it opens up all possibilities for you to move to and explore, and may be useful in a meditative, contemplative application.</description>

		<description>Ir lights would only help if the thing reflects ir-light. Otherwise it woult actually obscure results. 

Do we suspect the phenomenon to emit or reflect light?</description>

		<description>as much as i'd like to accomplish this feat first :)
have you seen these http://ghoststudy.com/monthly/apr05/video.htm ?
casual returning to the physical?
i find it very interesting that everything happened during one second, 5fps.. apparently frames before and after show nothing.. all kinds of hypothesis can be made... speed, motion, position..

could the IR be the key? perhaps if you block out all obscuring visible light + some additional ir-leds? some security cameras with motion detertors might be up to the task, what about sony nightshot? (takes the ir-filter out of the way)</description>

		<description>hey, I know this is probably the wrong place to ask, but what happened to UPC? Their website is up for grabs on GoDaddy.com</description>

		<description>Well, this is certainly (or, at least, ir seems to be) a very big step/milestone for you - w00t &#38; congrats and stuff!

I'm really happy for you as well...and it does seem like something's happening in the lower-right hand corner as Antisankari says...but then, it might just be the video being weird and choppy as most video camera records are when put on Youtube. ;&#62;.&#62;

Either way...congratulations!

		<description>You could do a cross-reference by setting up a geiger counter next to you. If your "obe-body" affects a geiger counter set up somewhere else,   then lack of that very same body inside of your real body would decrease activity at your real body while you are "having a trip".</description>

		<description>Those are good ideas.  But yes, cost is an issue :-).  I'm going to keep using my video camera and try to capture more OBEs.  Then in the future, I may move on to more elaborate capture systems.  I also want to set up my geiger counter and see if my OBE-self can affect it.

		<description>Antisankari is right, you can really mess around with things like exposure time and what not, to maximize what it is you are looking for. The only problem seems to be cost &#62;.</description>
