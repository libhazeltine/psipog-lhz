		<description>this would probably be the main reason for not doing the challenge.

		<description>How about instead of trying to win at the lottery do something more definite.  Such as aplying to the million dollar challenge and just show some TK or something.  Then you'll actually get the million $ and can fund your original idea in order to figure out the lottery thing.</description>

		<description>I had someone come into the store that I work at and ask if anyone had won big in it recently. Nobody had, so the person who asked said (rather loudly) "Then I'm not checking my ticket here."

I laughed because it isn't going to make a difference where the guy checks the ticket since the numbers have already been drawn.</description>

		<description>"though i vividly remember a story probably 12 or more years ago in VA where the couple that won big always choose the same numbers and one day theirs were drawn."

sooner or later someone has to win the lottery. regardless of who it is that wins, their bound to have some sort of story. but then there are all the other people who would have the same story, but have never won.

in other words, just because someone won playing a certain way doesn't mean that way is any more/less favorable than anything else.</description>

		<description>Well thats the general theory based on a misunderstanding of probability..

By playing the same numbers every game you'd imagine you have a better chance of getting your numbers pulled, because probability shouldn't favor those numbers that have already come up. However because each drawing is completely random yours odds are always technically the same for any set of numbers you choose, even if they've won before.

In theory your numbers will come up eventually but theres no assurance that it happens before every other combination has appeared 100 times as a winner.</description>

		<description>My friend just sent me a the link to your ver3.0 post. interesting stuff.  I have a question about lottery numbers though..i wonder what your reasoning is to pick different numbers each time, rather than play the same numbers and know that the numbers announced match the ones you play, rather than trying to pick something 'now' to match something that hasn't happened 'yet'. It would seem to me if part of the equation is intending or knowing, "i am holding the winning lottery ticket," then you could let the universe/random chance synchronize with your constant numbers rather than having two changing sets of numbers try to find each other.

i do admit when i play the numbers lotteries (rather than scratch off) i don't play the same numbers all the time...and it has been awhile since i played.  though i vividly remember a story probably 12 or more years ago in VA  where the couple that won big always choose the same numbers  and one day theirs were drawn. 

just wondering your thoughts,</description>
