		<description>Through my own practice. Psi training can greatly increase all skills. For me it was much more effective then training with the skill itself. For TK I was able to get some results on a popcan with 2 months of EM training, compared to probably 6+ months of training.</description>

		<description>Since everything is made of energy, every sort of manipulation, like PK, is some sort of EM.
So, it's not just the 'fountdation to build and strengthen other skills'.
That's only true if you refer to making Constructs and such, but not to the whole EM-thing.</description>

		<description>I think we can all agree that energy manipulation is the most basic form of psionics. 
Its the foundation to build and strengthen other skills.</description>

		<description>"non-perception." Not true... If you know it's there, you're clearly "perceiving" it :P. However, I'm just being a literal prick at the moment, you very well probably meant it in a less literal fashion. Either way though, Energy Manipulation requires perception, even if it is not the basic goal intended by the practitioner.</description>

		<description>Energy Manipulation tends to enhance other psychic abilities as it is the basic non-perception psychic ability.</description>

		<description>EM means Energy Manipulation. Unless Sean was talking about his recent English Muffin obsession... In which case it stood for English Muffin. 

Also, that sounds cool Sean, I was looking at it like a week ago. I'll try to make it. :)</description>
