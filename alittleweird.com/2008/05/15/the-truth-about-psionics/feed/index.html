		<description>i think that is a very good way to put it. i think that might be why people are like that. if they go with society too long, though, they will forget or not believe their past thoughts, like about finding inner peace, as i would put it.
because of so many people don't believe in this kind of stuff, it is hard to believe it ourselves.</description>

		<description>I think most of you take this to literally..
Of course, techniques can be useful, but it's not the source, Sean just tried to tell you all what the source of this all is, and that techniques are just a way of using that source.

Anyway, Sean, I totally agree with you on this post. ;)

		<description>I knew how to take in energy before I came to Psipog. Even as I was reading articles about how to do things, they didn't feel completely right to me. I took them with a grain of salt and went with my instincts as I developed my abilities, and I think that's what Sean is probably trying to say with this post.</description>

		<description>Too true, too true...


Like everyone says, it's all there, in you, and nobody cares...



Teches are NOT bullshit.


To the person that understands what you are saying,

teches ARE bs, but to the person that is confuses, which I think is the majority, they are not. They get you started,and keep you floatin until you can swim on your own.</description>

		<description>They sure were implied in that article and it was the point of it. As you said, some people never emancipate from what they read here and there and therefore never achieve success.</description>

		<description>I agree with stony1205 completely. Also, yes, many 14 year-olds do fall for every word (verbatim, mind you) you say. I am 13, but good thing I already have a stable base for my logic and future learning. Sea, I am not calling you stupid or a liar, but the comments could have been better worded. BTW, kiepmad, you just said some common sense things that weren't implied in the article but are accepeted by everyone in all communities.</description>

		<description>I can be man enough to admit that it is quite possible that I have not seen this post through the same lens as others.  Upon further review, I have a better sense of where Sean was coming from, specifically with the idea that people follow techniques verbatim.

But if the post was able to confuse me, it probably did so to others.  I was alerted to this post by a member of my community (who will remain anonymous).  It went something like this "Hey, I was reading Peebrain's new site, and he seems to think that articles are bullshit.  Is it true stony? Are you lying to us?  I mean, this guy ran PSIPOG" etc.

This was the kind of thing I was attempting to get at.  When a prominent figure calls techniques bullshit, you get that kind of result.  Then smaller communities have to deal with it.  That was my concern.

		<description>Techniques are an attempt to impart knowledge of something a person can't really comprehend without success and even then its by no means an objective sense.

Technique is useful in teaching guitar or baseball because theres obvious feedback or improvement. In psychic experience theres both a natural doubt thats not easy to get by and an inability to explain success systematically. Technique is helpful but it is neither a garenteed route to success or always required to achieve your own use of an ability.

In Hindu and Buddhist mythology these powers can manifest without your searching for them, while your following a path to enlightenment. In that sense techniques are not even a stepping stone. Now certainly to cultivate and improve your skill with an ability you'll require practice and no doubt thats developing your own technique. Your technique isn't necessarily helpful to another, try explaining to someone whose never moved their arm, how to move it.

Even though we do have a sense of the systematic 'whats happening to do what' explaining to someone how to do it isn't straightforward.</description>

		<description>Who is fighting here anything?
We are discussing :P

But I also think Stony's criticism is bad faith.
I think it was rather clear that what Sean wrote was not entirely to be taken by word.

I mean, what you say Stony is true on the one side, but I think Sean means the following: 

a) technique is not the ultimate goal, just a variable tool
b) techniques do not guarantee success. It depends on yourself
c) people must not lose themselves in believes they are confronted with, but
d) realize that they have potential in themselves they do not know of, but which, if controlled, are more useful then techniques and believes

is that correct?</description>
