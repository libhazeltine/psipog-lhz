				<p>I have a secret to tell everyone about psionics&#8230; others have figured it out already, but it&#8217;s time I let everyone know officially&#8230;</p>
<p>All techniques are bullshit.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need articles, you don&#8217;t need guidance, you don&#8217;t need answers, and you don&#8217;t need belief systems.  The only thing you need to do is look inwardly.</p>
<p>Now maybe that sounds like <em>I&#8217;m</em> the one bullshitting at this point :-).  Maybe I am! ;-D</p>
<p>Emotion is the name of the game.  Emotion is the currency of will power.  The only door that needs to be opened is understanding what you feel and why.  And the only way to do that is to look inside yourself.</p>
<p>The only benefit I can provide to you is simply putting into words what you <em>already</em> instinctively feel.  And maybe (if I&#8217;m lucky) I can also give you clues as to why you feel the way you do.  But ultimately - you don&#8217;t need me to do so.  It&#8217;s all inside yourself right now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>If I had malicious intent, I could play your emotions, and convince you that you need me.  This is what the vast majority of society does.  We go around, deceiving others into thinking they need us, and allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking we need something external to ourselves.  But ultimately, that&#8217;s not true.  There is nothing external to ourselves that we need.</p>
<p>Now some nit-pickers might argue that we need food, or oxygen.  No, we don&#8217;t.  Our <em>bodies</em> need food and oxygen.   Or maybe you&#8217;ll argue that we need love and attention.  We certainly need love - but must we look externally for love?  And we certainly don&#8217;t need attention - that&#8217;s your ego talking.  Be careful with how you define those words too - they&#8217;re certainly vague enough to cause confusion :-P.</p>
<p>The reason that all psionic techniques are bullshit is because the only purpose the techniques serve is to manipulate your emotions, in order to generate will power.  The techniques are 100% dependent on how well they can stir up emotions in your current belief system.  Techniques don&#8217;t produce results.  Emotions do.</p>
<p>Therefore, to become good at psionics, you must understand both what you are feeling, and why.  The better you understand yourself, the better you can recruit your emotions to serve your goals.  The only way to accomplish this is to dig inwardly.</p>
<p>Somewhere, under the layers of self-delusion and confusion, there exists a God-like being.  Stop searching outside of yourself.  Stop feeding your ego.  Will you passionately dig for truth, or will you be yet another victim of mind?  This is the greatest secret of psionics.</p>

			<p>Tenchique is a way of transferring recipes for producing desired results. If we could realiably transfer emotions from one another with no skill requirements, then there would be no problem.</p>
<p>But as most of us cant, we must find ways to communicate our consciously percevied processes to one another in order to teach. And techniques use common words and components that we all can relate to.</p>
<p>So yes. Techniques are as unimportant as speech is to our communication. It is after all the thought we wish to transfer, not some shockwaves from our throats!</p>

			<p>Sean, I can proudly say Iv&#8217;e completed my quest for knowledge.<br />

			<p>So &#8230; after all &#8230; there was an uber-mega-buttkick secret you kept from everybody while you ran PsiPog :D:D:D</p>
<p>Even though I already instinctively knew what you wrote, I laughed my ass off seeing it put into words for the first time.</p>
<p>Be careful about belief systems though, negative/positive self-talk DOES affect the results, that&#8217;s why NLP works. Empowering belief system sure can enchance the results we get using psychic abilites.</p>

			<p>Your taking the wrong message way if your thinking psychic power will be realized through overflowing emotion. You might achieve something through anger or excitement but it would be taxing to draw from those wells on a regular basis, and your control would likely be distracted as well. Its hard to explain the goal without using a paradox.</p>

			<p>I usually like what ever you post Sean because you really put some thought into it. But, in this one I think you should rethink this. </p>
<p>Sure, at some level techniques are useless. You can teach your self psionics, thats how it came to be known, some people taught them selfs. But, to say techniques are useless is just plain BS. What techniques are, are merely ways in which skills can be communicated to other interested persons and taught with the most efficiency and accuracy to achieve the highest results possible while keeping side effects at a minimum. Biology needs no books to understand how it works, but if you use the foundation you can understand more then what you are searching for. Kind of like the saying, &#8220;I can see far because I stand on the backs of giants&#8221;. Techniques are those giants, past knowledge on what works best. Just plain will power works for some but not so well for others. Only techniques can fill that gap and get others to the same level at a very fast level.</p>
<p>Techniques are useful, they are knowledge and theories. They are not used to control people unless there are mechanisms to do so. Psionic techniques and articles are the least controlling techniques out there. They are free to download, read, and teach. You don&#8217;t have to jump through a bunch of hoops to look at them, and few people put explicit or intentional views in them to control people.</p>

			<p>NeoPsychic:</p>
<p>Techniques for playing guitar (for example) are very useful.  There is one basic way everyone plays guitar, and therefore, techniques contain the knowledge of that basic method.</p>
<p>In psionics, there is no one way to accomplish something.  Ask different people, of different belief systems, how they do something psychic - and each person will give you drastically different techniques and theories about why their techniques work.</p>
<p>I am arguing that the reason for this is that the only purpose of the technique (in psionics) is to stir up emotion in your belief system.</p>
<p>Now, techniques are useful in that they do stir up emotion.  And emotion produces results.  So techniques are indirectly useful.</p>
<p>However, my point is that you don&#8217;t need the techniques.  The technique ITSELF is not what&#8217;s creating the effect.  So all the theories we come up with, surrounding the technique, are just reflections of our belief systems.  Not reflections of reality.</p>

<p>I think this is where we ultimately differ. I agree that the technique is not creating the effect. I agree that willpower is something that helps in psionic effects. But, I do not agree that it is the direct cause of psionics, or even one of the major players in one&#8217;s ability to use psionic skills. I think that it&#8217;s much more complicated then that. What exactly, I don&#8217;t know. But, I believe that for the most part, techniques are very closely related. I think that in skills like PK, there may be thousands of different techniques for it, but many are just personal variations on a &#8220;base&#8221; technique. I believe all psionic skills have a few &#8220;base&#8221; techniques that people impose their own personality into, to get more effect out of the technique.</p>
<p>If I accidentally repeated something you said, please excuse me, because I might be a little confused. =)</p>

			<p>I am a little disappointed by this post. You basically rejected Reality, Society, Psipog, and any other good thing I can think about, you stomped on them, spit in their face, and flushed them down the drain.</p>
<p>&#8211;<br />
Now some nit-pickers might argue that we need food, or oxygen.  No, we don’t.  Our bodies need food and oxygen.<br />
^^ That is rejecting Reality. You&#8217;re saying that bodies don&#8217;t matter. So why not just screw them and just go off to the Bahamas with our souls? Because we only have one life like this one.<br />
&#8211;</p>
<p>Or maybe you’ll argue that we need love and attention.  We certainly need love - but must we look externally for love?  And we certainly don’t need attention - that’s your ego talking.<br />
^^ That&#8217;s you rejecting Society. You&#8217;re saying we should not look for love outside of ourselves but be completely self-reliant. You&#8217;re saying the world is you. Everyone else doesn&#8217;t matter. You are trying to say ego is bad, but then you say that the only reliable source of anything is yourself.<br />
&#8211;</p>
<p>Also, about how techniques are crap. They are not crap. If there were no techniques, then no one would know how to start. Techniques help people realize how to access their emotions. Without techniques it&#8217;s like getting a hobo off the street and telling them to do graphic design. Yes, graphic design comes from the inside, but you need training. Without techniques, how many people do you think would have gone to Psipog, made you famous, and therefore come to this website? You said yourself that Psipog made you grow. Psipog made you grow because it was a living and breathing community. Without the people there (because of no techniques), you wouldn&#8217;t have grown. You just dissed Psipog.</p>
<p>I definitely have to agree with NeoPsychic.</p>

			<p>I think you&#8217;ve gone off the deep end on this one, old friend.  Specifically because there evident problems (both psychic and philosophical) that some people (NeoPsychic and fruo) have been sort of slapping at, but not really getting.</p>
<p>Without sounding like a complete jerk, I&#8217;ll try and run through bit by bit my objections to your rather&#8230;disheartening argument.</p>
<p>-&#8221;I have a secret to tell everyone about psionics… others have figured it out already, but it’s time I let everyone know officially…</p>
<p>All techniques are bullshit.&#8221;-</p>
<p>For years you&#8217;ve said to those starting out &#8220;We&#8217;re not keeping any secrets!&#8221;  Now, I do understand that it was under a different context, but I know people are thinking this.  Perhaps a different word choice?</p>
<p>I can also think of some &#8220;others&#8221; who have figured &#8220;it&#8221; out, and I wouldn&#8217;t consider them the most logically sane of people I know.  I&#8217;ve seen some reject the idea of gravity because it doesn&#8217;t fit with their worldview.</p>
<p>All techniques are bullshit, Sean, Really?  That&#8217;s a pretty large claim that is going to affect the credibility of many, many people, including the most respected members of the psionic community.  I hope you have enough evidence to back this one up.  Let&#8217;s continue reading.</p>
<p>-&#8221;You don’t need articles, you don’t need guidance, you don’t need answers, and you don’t need belief systems.  The only thing you need to do is look inwardly.&#8221;-</p>
<p>This assumes that your &#8220;soul&#8221; (assuming you have one, which can be quite a stretch to make, philosophically) is omniscient, specifically if you &#8220;don&#8217;t need answers&#8221;.  And on that point, if you don&#8217;t need answers, why look inward to begin with?  I agree that you don&#8217;t NEED articles, but I still list this as a great resources for beginners.  Ditto even more so with guidance.  Suppose someone runs into a problem psychically, that some mental block has them being unable to solve.  They &#8220;turn inwardly&#8221;, yet fail to find a solution.  What then? Are they just not &#8220;inward&#8221; enough? Can you imagine?</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Sean, I&#8217;m having trouble with this OBE thing, got some tips.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, according to my worldview, I shouldn&#8217;t give you guidance. Look inward.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Look inward? How am I supposed to do that?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Figure it out by looking inward.  I cannot give you a technique for looking inward, techniques are bullshit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tautology anyone?  Also, isn&#8217;t this whole thing, relying on emotion, a belief system in istself Sean?  I thought you just said we don&#8217;t need belief systems? Moving on.</p>
<p>-&#8221;Emotion is the name of the game.  Emotion is the currency of will power.  The only door that needs to be opened is understanding what you feel and why.  And the only way to do that is to look inside yourself.</p>
<p>The only benefit I can provide to you is simply putting into words what you already instinctively feel.  And maybe (if I’m lucky) I can also give you clues as to why you feel the way you do.  But ultimately - you don’t need me to do so.  It’s all inside yourself right now, at this very moment.&#8221; -</p>
<p>The first bit is nothing major.  The second is full of fun stuff.  Who are you to tell me what I instinctively feel?  Granted, in this situation I would have asked you for assistance, but you are not the authoritative interpreter on what I do or do not feel.  You&#8217;ve already said philosophically questionable things that I don&#8217;t agree with or &#8220;feel&#8221;.  The rest is kind of a &#8220;duh&#8221; type of situation.  Of course what I feel is &#8220;in&#8221; me.</p>
<p>-&#8221;If I had malicious intent, I could play your emotions, and convince you that you need me&#8221;-</p>
<p>And how would you go about doing that Sean? How does looking inward result in my ideas being manipulated? It doesn&#8217;t.  Thus, you would need to facilitate a technique of some type.  Now, that technique might be outside of the &#8220;standard&#8221; paradigm we use, but its a technique, a method, a series of actions with an intended purpose. </p>
<p>-&#8221;This is what the vast majority of society does.&#8221;-</p>
<p>Glad to see you think everyone is a dirty manipulator. Does this include yourself?  What about the &#8220;others&#8221; you spoke of earlier? Are they &#8220;above&#8221; the rest of us too?  This isn&#8217;t really my area, would a Sociologist like to chime in?</p>
<p>-&#8221;We go around, deceiving others into thinking they need us, and allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking we need something external to ourselves.  But ultimately, that’s not true.  There is nothing external to ourselves that we need.&#8221;-</p>
<p>It must be a really lonely world that you live in, Sean.  We are social creatures by nature, and soul or not, a world in which nobody needs anyone else doesn&#8217;t seem to be like the one in which we live, and does not seem to be desirable at all.</p>
<p>-&#8221;Now some nit-pickers might argue that we need food, or oxygen.  No, we don’t.  Our bodies need food and oxygen.&#8221;-</p>
<p>Get your nose out of Descartes, Sean.  You&#8217;re assuming that we have a soul, or that the &#8220;mind&#8221; is separate from the body.  This assumption is completely baseless in your argument, and yet you keep referring to it.  Perhaps you wrote of it somewhere else, but if you have, you should remind us where that post is located.  Otherwise, it seems you&#8217;re just using your position to force an idea into those who agree with everything you say.</p>
<p>-&#8221;We certainly need love - but must we look externally for love?&#8221;-</p>
<p>Narcissistic much?  You&#8217;re getting towards the idea that we should love no one but ourselves.  Love yourself, yes, but you&#8217;re going to need other people at some point. It is simply observed human nature.</p>
<p>-&#8221;And we certainly don’t need attention - that’s your ego talking&#8221;-</p>
<p>Same as love.  We don&#8217;t NEED attention, but it certainly feels nice doesn&#8217;t it?  One of the pleasures of life is to have a little spotlight now and then.  And if running a blog and posting &#8220;philosophy&#8221; isn&#8217;t attention, then what is?</p>
<p>-&#8221;The reason that all psionic techniques are bullshit is because the only purpose the techniques serve is to manipulate your emotions, in order to generate will power.  The techniques are 100% dependent on how well they can stir up emotions in your current belief system.  Techniques don’t produce results.  Emotions do.&#8221;-</p>
<p>What? This is just incorrect.  Perhaps the most obvious is energy manipulation.  Unless the constructs are programed, they&#8217;re simply useless balls of substance.  I can see your thought pattern:<br />
&#8220;Well, the article makes you interested in the psiball.  Thus that interest perks an emotion that wants to drive you to make it.  So then the psiball is created.&#8221;<br />
Great, but what emotion is being manipulated, and how do you go about manipulating that emotion?  Suppose you didn&#8217;t read the article about psiballs (but let&#8217;s assume you do know of their existence).  Go make one.  Seem open ended? It should, because you would have no idea where to begin. You can&#8217;t look inward, because you&#8217;ve never done anything like this before, and you haven&#8217;t established an argument to show that your &#8220;soul&#8221; should have this answer. </p>
<p>Even if you find this emotion by looking in (which in itself, is a technique of sorts, just not in our standard paradigm), and that emotion drums up will power, how do you utilize that will power in such a way as to produce a result?  Its possible, maybe, but the whole notion incredibly vague, and doesn&#8217;t seem very conducive of quick and reliable results.  Your &#8220;will&#8221; would have to stumble around until a psiball began to materialize. Pure emotion, without forethought and organization, is chaos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen emotions destroy results. You&#8217;ve seen it too.  But you&#8217;re ignoring the misses and only remember the hits here.  You&#8217;ve failed to mention that only the &#8220;right&#8221; emotions seem to bring about the best results. </p>
<p>-&#8221;Therefore, to become good at psionics, you must understand both what you are feeling, and why.  The better you understand yourself, the better you can recruit your emotions to serve your goals.  The only way to accomplish this is to dig inwardly.&#8221;-</p>
<p>This is pretty much the only paragraph that doesn&#8217;t have any blatant issues.</p>
<p>-&#8221;Somewhere, under the layers of self-delusion and confusion, there exists a God-like being.  Stop searching outside of yourself.  Stop feeding your ego.  Will you passionately dig for truth, or will you be yet another victim of mind?  This is the greatest secret of psionics.&#8221;-</p>
<p>Wow, Sean. Wow.  First, you&#8217;re not stating your opinion here. You&#8217;re standing on a podium, stating this as fact, or at least, this is how you present it.  You do not KNOW that there is a god-like being.  You might believe that you know, but you do not, in fact, know.  You have not provided any substance to this argument at all.  You&#8217;re expecting us to just take it as it is because you&#8217;re you.  Most of these 14 year olds will fall for it, but those who you&#8217;re trying to discredit by calling our websites &#8220;bullshit&#8221;, aren&#8217;t going to be swallowing this load.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another victim of mind&#8221;, Sean?  So what, we&#8217;re not supposed to use any logic now? Just believe what you say?  Perhaps this wasn&#8217;t your intent, but its what you&#8217;ve written.  Are some of your readers really this much like sheep?  You&#8217;ve played the God card to sum up your argument, and you&#8217;ve just let it at that.  Unbelievable.  And you have the nerve to call OUR communities &#8220;bullshit&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t dive into this new emotion-driven reality warping belief system that seems to have swept through the various communities (luckily not mine). It seems to tear the logic out of anyone who subscribes to it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;ve sounded mad about this post, its because I am. I&#8217;m infuriated. You can say whatever you want on your blog, but if you&#8217;re going to stand up and say &#8220;Look at me! I&#8217;ve got all the answers! I&#8217;ve got the long lost secret to psionics! All the others are just bullshitting!&#8221; and then provide NO argument to back it up, we&#8217;ve got a problem.  Your theory is full of self contradictions and tautologies, of which I&#8217;ve exampled a few.  Come, if you REALLY want to call my work bullshit, provide an argument that stands up.</p>
<p>To anyone who&#8217;s read this far, THIS is the real &#8220;secret&#8221; of psionics and always has been from the start:  Work smart, keep trying, be playful, and always remember to enjoy what you&#8217;re doing.  Psionics is about not only technique, but self discovery as well.</p>

			<p>Stony,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry my post offended you.  I&#8217;m a little confused as to why this particular post has offended you, when I feel as though I&#8217;ve been talking about this idea for the past year and a half.  This is the very idea I was supporting in my second, unfinished eBook.  I suggest reading it if you&#8217;re searching for the evidence and ideas behind this post.</p>
<p>I feel as though a lot of your post is just jumping to conclusions.  When did I claim that I wouldn&#8217;t provide guidance?  Where did I say I know what you instinctively feel?  Where did I say to turn off logic?  Where did I say that everyone should just blindly accept what I&#8217;m telling them?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m claiming that you don&#8217;t *need* guidance.  Not that I wouldn&#8217;t try and help if I could.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m claiming that my ability to help anyone is dependent on how well I understand what the person already instinctively feels.  I&#8217;m not claiming that I immediately understand what someone else instinctively feels - just that if I fail to understand what they instinctively feel, then I will fail at my attempts to help them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m claiming that it is the mind that acts against logic.  When I&#8217;m talking about &#8220;victim of mind&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about someone who only uses logic selectively.  I am arguing in favor of logic.</p>
<p>Just because I believe something doesn&#8217;t mean anyone else has to.  I am not telling people to blindly follow me - I&#8217;m just posting my thoughts on my blog.  Some people like to know what I think, and I enjoy sharing my thoughts for people to both digest and criticize.  Have I acted maliciously?</p>
<p>I would recommend reading my second eBook, reading some of my older blog posts, and then re-reading this post.  I don&#8217;t mind if people disagree with me - that&#8217;s helpful for me!  But I wouldn&#8217;t want to you to think I&#8217;m fighting against you, when I still perceive us to be on the same team, fighting the same fight.</p>

We are discussing <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>But I also think Stony&#8217;s criticism is bad faith.<br />
I think it was rather clear that what Sean wrote was not entirely to be taken by word.</p>
<p>I mean, what you say Stony is true on the one side, but I think Sean means the following: </p>
<p>a) technique is not the ultimate goal, just a variable tool<br />
b) techniques do not guarantee success. It depends on yourself<br />
c) people must not lose themselves in believes they are confronted with, but<br />
d) realize that they have potential in themselves they do not know of, but which, if controlled, are more useful then techniques and believes</p>
<p>is that correct?</p>

			<p>Techniques are an attempt to impart knowledge of something a person can&#8217;t really comprehend without success and even then its by no means an objective sense.</p>
<p>Technique is useful in teaching guitar or baseball because theres obvious feedback or improvement. In psychic experience theres both a natural doubt thats not easy to get by and an inability to explain success systematically. Technique is helpful but it is neither a garenteed route to success or always required to achieve your own use of an ability.</p>
<p>In Hindu and Buddhist mythology these powers can manifest without your searching for them, while your following a path to enlightenment. In that sense techniques are not even a stepping stone. Now certainly to cultivate and improve your skill with an ability you&#8217;ll require practice and no doubt thats developing your own technique. Your technique isn&#8217;t necessarily helpful to another, try explaining to someone whose never moved their arm, how to move it.</p>
<p>Even though we do have a sense of the systematic &#8216;whats happening to do what&#8217; explaining to someone how to do it isn&#8217;t straightforward.</p>

			<p>I can be man enough to admit that it is quite possible that I have not seen this post through the same lens as others.  Upon further review, I have a better sense of where Sean was coming from, specifically with the idea that people follow techniques verbatim.</p>
<p>But if the post was able to confuse me, it probably did so to others.  I was alerted to this post by a member of my community (who will remain anonymous).  It went something like this &#8220;Hey, I was reading Peebrain&#8217;s new site, and he seems to think that articles are bullshit.  Is it true stony? Are you lying to us?  I mean, this guy ran PSIPOG&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>This was the kind of thing I was attempting to get at.  When a prominent figure calls techniques bullshit, you get that kind of result.  Then smaller communities have to deal with it.  That was my concern.</p>

			<p>I agree with stony1205 completely. Also, yes, many 14 year-olds do fall for every word (verbatim, mind you) you say. I am 13, but good thing I already have a stable base for my logic and future learning. Sea, I am not calling you stupid or a liar, but the comments could have been better worded. BTW, kiepmad, you just said some common sense things that weren&#8217;t implied in the article but are accepeted by everyone in all communities.</p>

			<p>I knew how to take in energy before I came to Psipog. Even as I was reading articles about how to do things, they didn&#8217;t feel completely right to me. I took them with a grain of salt and went with my instincts as I developed my abilities, and I think that&#8217;s what Sean is probably trying to say with this post.</p>

			<p>I think most of you take this to literally..<br />
Of course, techniques can be useful, but it&#8217;s not the source, Sean just tried to tell you all what the source of this all is, and that techniques are just a way of using that source.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sean, I totally agree with you on this post. <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>i think that is a very good way to put it. i think that might be why people are like that. if they go with society too long, though, they will forget or not believe their past thoughts, like about finding inner peace, as i would put it.<br />
because of so many people don&#8217;t believe in this kind of stuff, it is hard to believe it ourselves.</p>
