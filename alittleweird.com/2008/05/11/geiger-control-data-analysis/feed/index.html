		<description>Alright, now we have something going on here! This looks like a real experiment now. I can't wait to see the results at the end of the week.</description>

		<description>I read somewhere on the net that background radiation levels, depending on your area go up to 50 CPM on average. So be happy Sean that you're in a place with relatively low radiation hehe.</description>

		<description>i've seen that thing at 26 quite a few times, so i guess that means we have some level of effect over it, even if it is just a few clicks. (though, even that is awesome when you think about it)

it would be interesting to see what numbers you would get if you did a weeks worth of data while it were still connected.

btw, a link to this data from the GC game page would probably be a good idea.</description>
