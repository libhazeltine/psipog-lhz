		<description>Sean: I wanted to give some good props to this article, although a little late huh?

Everyone else: You know what makes human beings so amazing? We humans have the ability to choose over our innate desires.  They don't control us.

We have the amazing ability look past the pleasures and delusion to seek the truth if necessariy, we even have the choice to remain blind to the truth.  That's how amazing human beings are.  We might not all agree with our species' decision, however that's not for us to decide, is it?

I like the truth, unlike delusions and lies, it doesn't change.  It is like a firm ground to stand on.</description>

		<description>But we necessarily need to know that although sex, food and sleep are "good", they are not what is important in life.
And if you call them "reality", they are just as we perceive reality when we do not question it. There are reasons why religions value asceticism so much.
What does sex, food and sleep give you, if you know that you are dying tomorrow? If you lived life only to acquire food, sex and sleep, I think you might feel pretty lousy in the end.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;All that matters to us primitive humans is sex, food, and sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cmon people.  The truth is this: sex feels good and food tastes good.  Overly simplistic? Yes, but true nonetheless.  Reality is a system that we have to work inside of, whether we understand it fully or not at all.  How else can we attempt to perceive reality if we don't use the "hardware" or senses we have?  These things release endorphines that make us feel good, but also influence how we think and perceive, so the hardware can't be completely separate from the software, can it?

We probably won't have enough time on this earth to conquer our own instincts.  We'd better learn to live with them.</description>

		<description>Cultivating the human mind is like trying to convert rock into fertile soil. There'll always be weeds. Our society is pretty hedonistic, I mean, truth be told, most people couldn't care less about the truth. All that matters to us primitive humans is sex, food, and sleep.</description>

		<description>Playing the blame game does not get us very far. However, I can see the benefit of being able to recognize that maybe our hardware does suck. And maybe it does cause a lot of problems. 

But it has been shown that individuals can make adapt to situations and that we are capable of overcoming our limitations and being more open minded, more loving, more nurturing of ourselves, our environment, and other things.

Do we need truth?

I do.</description>

		<description>"...do humans need truth?"

IMO if all truth is let out into society, it will collapse into chaos. Our society is built upon delusion.

For example, many people want to find out the truth about death. There are many delusions as to what will really happens and I am not going to say one is more true then the other. Though if we were to find out the truth, who knows what would happen...

Its just another of life's many mysteries; if there was a giant circle of all the knowledge possible then what we know now as a civilization that is correct would be smaller then this period.</description>

		<description>"I have come to believe that it is not the society or X thing to blame for our current state. It is our hardware that sucks."

Agreed. It seems the human mind can be easily fooled to believe just about anything whether proof is provided or not. But then again, as with the analogy of the 3d engine for amiga, its the best we have at the moment. 

I think a better question is, do humans need truth? I know many people that are happy with their delusions.</description>

		<description>Then again, (Happy B Day here too...) as television is an istrument build solely for presenting programs and as lamps are made to provide light, are our physical bodies and minds that come with them really "made" to actually perceive anything?

If our ape ancestors did well with their.
1) Eat
2) Sleep
3) Mate
4) Fight

algorithm, then perhaps our brains have an extremely strong bias towards traits and beahaviors that make achieving those goals easier.

Greed for food.
Laziness for rest.
Agression for mating opportunities and perhaps for gaining resources and food.

Pondering this stuff seems like trying to build a 3d engine for Amiga (it has been done btw.), Result will run poorly and look like crap, but it still is the best model of 3d environment possible to produce with the hardware in hand.
