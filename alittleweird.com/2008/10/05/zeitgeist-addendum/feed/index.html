		<description>Much better than the first film, which, while containing interesting controversial information, was mostly irrelevant and speculative.

This one illustrates the main problem with our economic structure in a more succinct manner, and actually offers a solution, far-fetched as it may be.  Still, I have to agree with most of it.  I was actually surprised to see how similar some elements of the film were to my own ideas, which I thought were very uncommon.</description>

		<description>This video points out some good stuff to know!

DOLLER BILLS!!
Your money is taxed because it was lent to the country to begin with! Income tax should be called Interest!

The only reason these guys are in power is because our CULTure is based on consumerism, and we just want to keep giving the assholes all our money! BUY LOCAL WHEN YOU CAN!!

We need to end hunger, and money is keeping us on a leash.

Support the idea of community hydroponic, year round, vegitable gardens!

That is a good place to start.</description>

		<description>I still think this series of films is wrong in terms of religion. 

The rest of the stuff it bombarded me with I at least keep an open mind too, so basically I am of the same disposition as I was when I watched the first zeitgeist.

I shall continue to search for the truth myself, because the only truth that is worth trusting is the one you find yourself...</description>

		<description>At arcitectus: Well it seems what they're hoping for is that it won't be an institution, but that it will be a collaborate effort by everyone, that all ideas and inventions will be shared with the whole of society for the main reason that everyone will want to share their ideas, and the resorces to make those inventions a reality will be so abundant that there will be no need for anyone to fight over them, they can just have them.

You're right though, chances are we will only see the beginnings of something like that in our lifetimes as people will hold on to the money against all other reason nowadays.

The only concern that wasn't addressed for me in this video was what about over population?  If everyone can live a potentially healthy and wealthy life then they can have bajilions of children if they really wanted to, and I'm sure some would.</description>

		<description>I just finished watching the video and have some comments.

Overall I liked the video and agree with a lot of what it discusses. I agree that our system needs an overhaul. I agree with the idea of rising above culture and society, and not participating in it, as a show of non-violent protest. 

It also seems that one of the major aims of the video is to talk about how all institutions essentially must go, then what about the one you're proposing? Not saying that it would not be better, but it is simply substitution and still available to corruption. Man still has ego and desire, and as such is still open to corruption even in a seemingly utopian society.

If we lived in a resource based society, wouldn't resources become the new currency, would we still not fight over the control of said resources much like we do now?

Just as it has taken centuries to breed certain norms into us, it will take centuries to breed them out. 

It will have to be slow and methodical process, as to do so otherwise would create to much upheaval both socially and psychologically. The paradigm would shift to much to fast.

Just my 2 cents.</description>

Whom ever wanted a better world.  Has a chance now to see one idea of one, exsplained, and put forth to them.  Not a roadmap they must follow... but what  at the vary least.. is a good start.</description>
