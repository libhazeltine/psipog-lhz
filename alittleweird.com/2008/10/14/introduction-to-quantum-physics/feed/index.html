		<description>yes, but that isn't the scientific consensus ^
the accepted reality of small things is fundamentally indeterministic.</description>

		<description>Could it be possible that electrons and other particles in quantum physics are actually moving in such a way that we cannot calculate it as of yet?</description>

		<description>I head energy and matter couldn't be created or destroyed  no matter what. O_o quantum physics is so amazeing. :)</description>

		<description>Even more interesting than the momentum-location uncertainty relation is the energy-time uncertainty relation. Effectively, if 'something' happens near instantaneously, the change in energy of a system because of that 'something' becomes impossible to predict. General Newtonian mechanical laws of energy conservation dissolve, and energy can be created and destroyed from nothing.</description>

		<description>I think Im actually going to recommend my uni to hire that predophile as a lecturer. He is more amusing than 85% of the current lip movers. Oo</description>

		<description>It's amazing...there's also a video on youtube about quantum physics that I think everyone should watch...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc

Nevermind the creepy pedophile in the cape--it actually discusses legit and fascinating points...

The universe is a strange place, and this stuff is proof that we've only scratched the top of the iceberg.</description>

		<description>Cool now i understand the univers! *manic laugh*

being serios though, i wonder how an atom would respond to actually being stopped alltogether.
...
i think something bad would happen. &#62;.&#62;</description>

		<description>If we could "force" the direction from the outside and determine the position, we would know both at the same time :P

Or by stopping the thingy alltogether, we would have its position as a constant and then determining its direction.



Sounds simple, yet for some reason or another is impossible.
Go figure.</description>

		<description>Cool, glad to see that other people are interested in this kind of stuff. Uncertainty takes away a sense of security about how the universe operates, but it also seems to bring unspoken freedom with it. Still makes me wonder why things behave mechanically on a larger scale. If you add up all the uncertainties, do they really matter?</description>
