		<description>i don't like controlling my dreams...sometimes they're just fun rides and sometimes they tell me important stuff i didn't relize when i was awake...the only exeption to this is when im having a nightmare...i don't enjoy riding that dark horse very much...i think just being aware of your dreams can be enough, besides...why have a lucid dream when your imagination works so much better

have a good night</description>

		<description>Thats pretty sweet Charlie, I just have a quick question. I have no experience with OBE's so I was wondering what you meant by the beeping/ringing noise?</description>

		<description>Hi ya. 

I know this is off topic but since I do not own a webcam i'll write to you all here instead, hope you don't mind. :P
I just want to share an OOBE I had yesterday. I was lying in bed watching harry potter and the order of the phoenix on my puter around 2.00 pm and I fell asleep. I had a lucid dream but I din't do anything cool, I just let the dream play on for fun. Anyway, I woke up and felt a tingeling feeling all over my body but especielly around my stomach. I almost laughed out loud beacause the feeling was so strong so I scratch my belly and moved around a little to make it go away. I opened my eyes slightly and watched the screen of my computer for just a little while and then I suddenly started to hear the familiar beeping/ringing noise. "Time to leave" I thouhgt and my vision changend, my room looked much brighter than before. I remained still for a couple of seconds then I slid out. I floated accross my room and past my computer, I almost went throuhg the wall. I felt that I had a relaxed attidue so that I this time would be able to have a longer trip then usual but unfortunatly I wanted to make my vison more clear by opening my eyes so I poped back.

 I think it was a cool experince because I've never been able to get out so easy and I did it even though I laid awake in bed and because I could actully witness the chaning from awarness of my physical body to energy/astral body.</description>

		<description>I registered for the forums, but I have trouble inducing lucid dreams. They usually happen when I'm waking up, but rarely...ish. I LD because I'll awaken to a half-sleep stage, continue to think about my dream, then fall back into it again lucid. The problem is that when I wake up, I usually cannot afford to go back to sleep. I have to get up and go. Therefore, I signed up for the forums, but not the project.

Sounds awesome, though. I'd love to experience that (the meetup in the green room).</description>
