		<description>It's been a while since anything has even been said on this issue. If the first of the seven trumpets is to sound, THIS would be what is happening, taken straight from the Christian Bible:

"The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, which fell on the earth; and a third of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
                                     Revelation 8:7"

And if he claims the seventh seal has been opened already, this would have also happened:

"When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood, 13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale; 14 the sky vanished like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. 15 Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong, and every one, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 16 calling to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; 17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand before it?'"

... I never saw anything like that... I think we already know that this guy is almost as bad as Fred Phelps. This man is officially a fake.(Most likely you've come to that conclusion already but I figured I'd comment on it)</description>

		<description>I've already been there. We'll see how it turns out.

Thanks anyway, Sean.</description>

		<description>ShadowPhoenix:

You might be interested to know that our "prophet" has predicted that the first of the seven trumpets is going to sound on April 17th, and continue for 7 weeks.  So if we seen tens of thousands of deaths, starting on the 17th, then we'll know how accurate he really is.  Check out his personal site where he talks about it in his latest blog post: http://www.ronaldweinland.com/</description>

		<description>I've read one of the two books so far.

I gotta say, I think of myself as a Christian, though not necessarily a very good one, and this scares the crap out of me. I've always been taught that the end times will occur eventually, but it was never believed that it would happen so soon. Yet, having read one book alone, he does present some interesting evidence. It is unsure whether or not he is speaking the truth, but I tend to believe he is, simply because some things are so incredible that no sane person would lie about them.</description>

		<description>Very interesting.  I downloaded both e-books, and will read them in my spare time.  


I have no way to know if he is telling the truth or not, so I will not comment on that.</description>

		<description>psh.. trained experts with sophisticated machines cant even predict the weather, now this guy knows the end is near?

the bible was wrote by man, for man, a long ass time ago, 

the reason they wrote it .. (i think).. is because the people of the past were barbaric, did whatever they wanted,  
and they needed a way to control them, make them act "good" and less like animals , which isnt really a bad thing.. just not the truth

I seriously doubt that any kingdom is going to come out of nowhere to take over.. 
actually.. he said it was the end.. but said that people would survive... so its not the end?
.. that part confused me a little

======== short version ===============
the most likely end of the world would be a man-made one.. not a biblical one..</description>

		<description>I read somewhere, some time ago, that the Book of Revelations wasn't supposed to be a prophecy like most people think. According to what I read it was supposed to be a code that talked against the Roman Emperor of the time. 
When it talked about the Beast it was refering to the Emperor, and the 666 thing was just a code for his name (according to this, Romans used to translate names to numbers, so instead of saying "Sean" we would call him 350 or something).

I don't know how true this is, but it sure is interesting to see it from another point of view!</description>
