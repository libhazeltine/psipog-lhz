		<description>It seems like a theory associated with the second technique would lead to the existence of something like a matrix reality. I believe there's an Oxford professor who is claiming that the odds of us existing as programs inside super-computers are greater than the odds of this being the real world. Cool stuff to say the least.</description>

		<description>Try using something like the brainwave generator in order to put you in the right state of mind. I would use some combination of 3.5 and 4 hz which should, in theory, create a state of mind in which you are psychically aware, and a state in which you will feel the unity that you may want as you are picking them.

The facts are that you will always have the same chance of winning the lottery no matter how many people are in it or how much money is in the pot. I find that the best way to think about it is that it doesn't matter...

I dunno, just a suggestion.</description>

		<description>You should try the pick 3's and the pick 4's and then go up.
The pick 3's are regulary drawn, and the odds are much less, too.</description>

		<description>I hope you know what you're doing, the mafia will come to ask fore some of the prize $ pie.


The lotter numbers are :
"Gravity Pick

A "gravity pick machine" has a drum with rotating arms inside; the drum itself may or may not rotate. A number of balls, each bearing a possible winning number, are dropped into the drum while it is spinning. A hole on the side or bottom of the drum allows the balls to drop onto a tray, one at a time (the tray is generally inclined so as to allow the numbers to go to the end and allow the other balls to fall into place). Machines of this type are used in Lotto type games, such as 'Lotto 6-49', Lotto 6/48 or other formulas and the American games Mega Millions, Hot Lotto, and Powerball. See the UK National Lottery.

A similar method is used to draw numbers from a manually-operated bingo cage; a weighted cup catches the ball, and drops it onto the tray as the cage is rotated. This variant was at one time used by both the Pennsylvania Lottery and the Illinois Lottery; in this variant, a cover is placed strategically, so as to obscure extra balls drawn beyond the number called for by the game matrix.

[edit] Air mix

Another type of lottery machine has a fan in the bottom the blows the balls around the inside of the container. The winning numbers go up and out through a tube. This is often used in "pick 3" and "pick 4" games, and also sees use in some "lotto" games; generally, either several tubes are in the container, or a single tube is used, and the ball is mechanically pushed onto a tray.

Though similar in style to the latter type of "air mix" machines, those currently used by the Powerball game do not use air mix; it is more in tune with a "gravity pick" machine, with the mixing paddles at the bottom of the machine. As the mixing paddle slows down, the ball lands on a pedestal, where it is carried to the top of the machine and then pushed onto the tray.

[edit] Random number generator

Some lotteries use computerized random number generators, either alongside or in place of a mechanical draw machine. These are more "cost-effective:" with mechanical equipment, machines and balls have to be replaced periodically. However, these are not as interesting to watch, and may give a player a sense that the lottery is being rigged.

[edit] Security measures

Because of the massive payoff for a successful cheat, lottery machines are subject to strict security measures. In some cases there are several machines and several sets of balls, and the combination to be used is selected at random just before the draw."
from wikipedia, so shouldn't you be able to TK the balls or the machines themselves?
Or do you want to find the winning numbers?</description>

		<description>What do you mean by praying for the nubmers? What do you pray to?
How does it give you results? Numbers come to your mind afterwards?

Sounds totally insane, yet tell me more about it ;)

It's great to have an enormous goal that constantly pushes you to your limits at paranormal.</description>

		<description>Along the same lines as the video taping thing, a couple years ago when I was still pissing around with a psi-wheel, the only way I could get it to move pretty much every time was to point my webcam at it then watch my computer screen... I think it might be something about the added disconnect from reality. Its a little far fetched to say, "The wheel I am looking at will start moving." However, "The wheel in this video is going to spin." is a much easier thing to grasp mentally. At least, I think so.</description>

		<description>Actually I believe there is one guy that won a jackpot prize 3 or 4 times in the states. I read about him years ago though, so I can't recall the specifics.

It is Friday the 13th.. maybe I'll run over and get a quick random set.</description>
