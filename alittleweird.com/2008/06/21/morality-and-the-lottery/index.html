			<div class="entry">
				<p>I feel like such a sucker for thinking so much about the topic of winning the lottery, but I can&#8217;t help it - it embodies everything I care about, in a poetic sense.  Perhaps I just use it as an excuse to think about hard topics? ;-P</p>
<p>I was laying in bed, throwing my orange ball up at the ceiling, debating with myself about the morality of winning the lottery.  If I could find a way to win, would it be cheating?  What overall goal am I aiming for, and is this goal moral?  Am I just doing it because I want to escape the rat race of living paycheck to paycheck?  Or is there an honest and healthy reason for my obsession?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t lie to myself&#8230; I know that part of me desperately wants to transcend society&#8217;s dependence on money.  By winning the jackpot, I will essentially free myself from years of burden and conformity required by society in order to pay for the necessities of life.  But free myself to what end?  What would I do with my time, once liberated?</p>
<p>There is a divine balance to reality.  Any push away from truth creates a perfectly calculated, equal and opposite push towards truth.</p>
<p>If my theories are correct, then society has made a gamble against truth.  Society has taken the stance of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221;.  The lottery embodies this assumption by society.</p>
<p>But if the assumption is false - if things happen for a reason, and there is an underlying meaning in everything - then I should be able to win the lottery.  Not for the money - but for the point of demonstrating the falseness of society&#8217;s assumption.  After all, who am I to say that I am right, and society is wrong?  What evidence have I presented society with?  As far as society is concerned, I&#8217;m just a peebrain with a blog :-).</p>
<p>So, my goal is to demonstrate to society that the assumption of &#8220;random things happen, and sometimes it&#8217;s just coincidence&#8221; is false.  Now maybe <em>I</em> am wrong - maybe society&#8217;s assumption is correct.  In which case, I won&#8217;t win the lottery, and my failed demonstration can be used as evidence that some things <em>are</em> random.  Of course, that&#8217;s not the outcome I believe will come to pass :-), but reality will be the judge of that.</p>
<p>Now - I believe that this goal is moral.  My goal is rooted in revealing truth - whether I&#8217;m correct or incorrect.  However, does this answer the question of what to do with the money, once I win?</p>
<p>Yes, I believe it does.  Now that I&#8217;ve defined my goal, and my goal is moral, I can more easily see what follows.</p>
<p>After demonstrating that society&#8217;s assumption is false, I must spend the money on discovering the truth.  It&#8217;s the only moral way to balance out the situation.  I can&#8217;t take advantage of society&#8217;s ignorance, then disappear with the money to lead a selfish life of abundance.  Once I win, it will become my responsibility to spend the money on restoring balance.</p>
<p>So, let it be known:</p>
<p>If I win the jackpot, then I will use the money to research the topic of both how society allows itself to become deceived, and what the truth actually is.  I will create an organization in order to accomplish this research.  I am announcing this because, in the event that I win, I want to ensure that everyone keeps me honest.  I am human, and I will definitely be tempted to just pack up my bags, and live a peaceful private life.  However, since I know that using society&#8217;s ignorance for my own personal gain is immoral, I want to declare my intention publicly.  I will do everything in my power to remain faithful to my word - but, if I start to flake out, then I hope those reading this proclamation will remind me of my obligation.</p>
<p>Oh boy :-P.</p>

			<p>Who cares about morality when it&#8217;s about money? Ok, morality is important and we can&#8217;t forget about it as it&#8217;s keeping our world in one piece (sort of), but lets face the truth - you can&#8217;t do anything without money these days. Remember, Machiavelli used to say: &#8220;the end justifies the means&#8221; - who cares how did you win a lottery? The important thing is what you&#8217;re going to do with money. I guess in this case a reasonable thing to do is to finace a research to learn &#8220;how the hell did I win?!&#8221; lol</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m a bad man, but I think that one should not worry about things other just don&#8217;t see ;).</p>

			<p>Did previous winners of the lottery somehow stumble onto the way to &#8220;win&#8221; without realizing it? Or was that just &#8216;luck&#8217;, &#8216;coincidence&#8217;, or &#8216;chance&#8217;?</p>
<p>Your goal of using the money for other than self-fulfillment  (or is it? :-P), and easy living, is admirable.</p>

			<p>If you were to make an organization to research truth, I&#8217;d definitely join it.<br />
It does seem like a moral way to go about it too, and I agree with SheepKing that it is admirable to not let yourself get taken by selfish thoughts. I wish you (a continued) good luck with winning!</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m running my own Lottery Project - in the first time it was just fun - I&#8217;ve &#8220;heard&#8221; numbers in my head, but I took wrong ticket (for wrong lottery) even if my sub-c was screaming &#8220;not this one, looser&#8221; - I ignored it, if I would listen I would hit 4 number out of 7 and I would be about 6 thousands dollars richer. </p>
<p>Second and third time I think I have focused too much on money, as a result I&#8217;ve hit only 3 out of 6 numbers winning in total $4 - but I spent almost $40 so not good :).</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m changing tactics - I don&#8217;t want to win, I want to hit as many numbers as I can - see the difference? If I hit 4 or more our of 6, money will &#8220;come automatically&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sub-c is complicated &#8220;entity&#8221; - I think this tactics will trick it somehow as I won&#8217;t focus on winning a lot of money but on prooving myself &#8220;yes, I can do this&#8221;. </p>
<p>What is interesting - before first win I have made a deal with sub-c - &#8220;if I win, I will give 1/3 to my mom&#8221; - I did win (yeah, $2 lol) and I did give 1/3 to my mom. Maybe this will help someone :).</p>
<p>Right now I guess I have to make a quick deal with something to get $4 on my PayPal account so enough of this commenting.</p>

			<p>It has been my experience that no good deed goes unpunished.  I know that&#8217;s pretty pessimistic, but that&#8217;s how things work for me.  Where I&#8217;m going with this is that your long streak of not winning is probably the punishment, and the worse the punishment the greater the deed is.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;d certainly be interested in joining your bankroll if you start an organization.</p>
<p>If the world truly is based upon a collective tug of consciousness, then yes, any conflict you have internally with obtaining something would be an obstruction to overcome. I believe this is in the foundation of the law of attraction; and even without a supernatural chain through everything, doubt is long known to hold a person back from achievement.</p>
<p>Pessimism is as well placed as optimism, in a neutral world; but the optimistic tend to have more determination to see their goal to the end.</p>

			<p>SheepKing: As far as general experience goes I guess I can only give examples.  Because my neighbor got laid off and doesn&#8217;t have enough money to buy gas I went over and mowed his heightening lawn, as repayment he shot my lawn mowers tires out.  I go to cut up a tree that is blocking people from moving, drive all the way out there and the chain saw breaks right when I start it&#8230;just as some examples.  It just seems to happen consistently so I&#8217;ve pretty much accepted it as a truth.  As far as it relates to this&#8230;it probably doesn&#8217;t and  that was probably my least productive comment ever, but it was late (like now) and I felt I should say it.</p>
