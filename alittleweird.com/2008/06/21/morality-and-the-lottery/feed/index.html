		<description>SheepKing: As far as general experience goes I guess I can only give examples.  Because my neighbor got laid off and doesn't have enough money to buy gas I went over and mowed his heightening lawn, as repayment he shot my lawn mowers tires out.  I go to cut up a tree that is blocking people from moving, drive all the way out there and the chain saw breaks right when I start it...just as some examples.  It just seems to happen consistently so I've pretty much accepted it as a truth.  As far as it relates to this...it probably doesn't and  that was probably my least productive comment ever, but it was late (like now) and I felt I should say it.</description>

		<description>I'd certainly be interested in joining your bankroll if you start an organization.

If the world truly is based upon a collective tug of consciousness, then yes, any conflict you have internally with obtaining something would be an obstruction to overcome. I believe this is in the foundation of the law of attraction; and even without a supernatural chain through everything, doubt is long known to hold a person back from achievement.

Pessimism is as well placed as optimism, in a neutral world; but the optimistic tend to have more determination to see their goal to the end.</description>

		<description>Deathminister: I don't understand your philosophy on that, or your general experience. Can you please explain it more in depth?</description>

		<description>It has been my experience that no good deed goes unpunished.  I know that's pretty pessimistic, but that's how things work for me.  Where I'm going with this is that your long streak of not winning is probably the punishment, and the worse the punishment the greater the deed is.</description>

		<description>I'm running my own Lottery Project - in the first time it was just fun - I've "heard" numbers in my head, but I took wrong ticket (for wrong lottery) even if my sub-c was screaming "not this one, looser" - I ignored it, if I would listen I would hit 4 number out of 7 and I would be about 6 thousands dollars richer. 

Second and third time I think I have focused too much on money, as a result I've hit only 3 out of 6 numbers winning in total $4 - but I spent almost $40 so not good :).

Now I'm changing tactics - I don't want to win, I want to hit as many numbers as I can - see the difference? If I hit 4 or more our of 6, money will "come automatically".

Sub-c is complicated "entity" - I think this tactics will trick it somehow as I won't focus on winning a lot of money but on prooving myself "yes, I can do this". 

What is interesting - before first win I have made a deal with sub-c - "if I win, I will give 1/3 to my mom" - I did win (yeah, $2 lol) and I did give 1/3 to my mom. Maybe this will help someone :).

Right now I guess I have to make a quick deal with something to get $4 on my PayPal account so enough of this commenting.</description>

		<description>If you were to make an organization to research truth, I'd definitely join it.
It does seem like a moral way to go about it too, and I agree with SheepKing that it is admirable to not let yourself get taken by selfish thoughts. I wish you (a continued) good luck with winning!</description>

		<description>Did previous winners of the lottery somehow stumble onto the way to "win" without realizing it? Or was that just 'luck', 'coincidence', or 'chance'?

Your goal of using the money for other than self-fulfillment  (or is it? :-P), and easy living, is admirable.</description>

		<description>Maybe reality requires me to make a moral commitment in order for me to win?  Or maybe my subconscious requires it?</description>
