		<description>If it's Ronald Weinland you're talking about, he is from a cult evangelist church in the USA and factions of his church promote child abuse, emotional torture and in general, extremely unchristian and inhumane practices. google his name, and a website caled "painful truth" to find out about certain followers of his so called religion.
He has since retracted his statement about anything happening by today, July 16th, and has used whatever licence it is that his (seemingly Alzheimer ridden) God has permitted him. Very scary but not because of Armageddon, I reckon ten minutes with these guys and you'd be begging for the end of the world pronto.</description>

		<description>If it does happen I'd say it'd be around 4th of July, just because that's when us filthy americans like to blow stuff up for fun, and either one of us will do it (for lulz or less more than likely) or the "terrorists" will think of it as a symbolic date (like 911)....and now that I think of it when it happens I think I should be the first to blame McCain and say that its a conspiracy to get us to stay in the war.</description>

		<description>Just some other shit, but if it really is going to happen, I won't care, although I still want to do some things in life *evil laughter*

anyways, the end of the world that the maians (sp) (?) predicted seems better then this stuff, so I'll stick to 2012 :P</description>

		<description>A trend I've noticed is that it's always the end times. Erryone is always saying that the end is nigh. How nigh? Can't say, but it's certainly nigh.

Prophets for profit, I tell you.


I'm gonna say, it won't be funny if a bomb does go off. What's funny is that when a bomb doesn't go off, he'll say "Yay, some believers saved us from the bomb. However, the meteorite Wormwood is coming! Getcher Meteorite Helmets! NASA Secretly blew up the meteor! Yay! We're saved again. Lookoout..." etcetera.</description>
