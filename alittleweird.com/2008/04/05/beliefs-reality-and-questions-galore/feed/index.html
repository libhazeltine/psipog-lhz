		<description>Maybe #3 is a combination of #1, #2, and other things we don't know (and can't ever find out)?

Just a thought.</description>

		<description>beliefs are dangerous. people kill and die for beliefs...even if they are untrue. Ideas however are chagable and can evolve. Its kinda like the premise of chaos magick...belief makes the magick...not the system or anything else. So don't take such things so seriously...otherwise you could end up in a grave situation and end up not being able to put down what you called up...Thats what i believe anyways.
Love is the law...love under will
aw hell air es</description>

		<description>It seems your beliefs are shared with many others, and it is also the belief of Buddhism ^^.

PK relating to probabilities is real, but the outcome will not effect the reality significantly. Winning a lottery (millions) would completely alter the world that you are in right now, thus the chances of that happening is not that high. Unless it is written in your life, or seemed that it will happen because you did so much good things, it will have a higher chance of happening.


After all, your beliefs are shared with millions if not more people,its good to know.</description>

		<description>I believe the mental and physical realities cross and intersect at some points, thus explaining macro-psychokinesis. As scientists have shown, thinking is done in the brain. The brain uses electric and magnetic impulses. Therefore these physical objects affect mental reality. A lot of articles on psionics, some even written by you, have used the fact that the brain sends out waves which could affect large objects such as the pinwheel.</description>

		<description>This post kind of shocks me. Because these are the exact thoughts and ideas I've managed to scrap together last month. Things happening, filled with some sort of meaning. Almost like someone is trying to show me something about myself I didn't know before. I'm not saying god exists or doesn't exist (even though I do believe in a higher being), but it sure seems like someone/something like it does. However, it could all just be my imagination or my almost paranoid perception. *checks behind back* ;-)
Strangely, every time one of these "metaphors" for my life occurs, I get a sudden burst of memories popping up randomly in my head. It's almost like some kind of "instant replay" button is hit. Sometimes, memories that I haven't been able to access for a long time; stuff that has long since faded into the unconscious part of my mind. 
I don't want to go in detail, because a lot of personal things are involved in this. But I can give some rough reference frames. Here's a typical event:
For example, I meet someone I associate a certain quality with. And then someone else just "randomly" walks by, with me knowing that this person has the exact opposite qualities. Synchronity... In itself, a rather weird thing. I start comparing these two subconsciously, and an idea/philosophical stuff/whatever pops into my head.
Three seconds later, I manage to recall situations from my life that aren't even connected to this event and which I didn't know I could still remember.

What puzzles me is this burst of memories. Does it happen to other people too or is it just my own sick mind :-D???</description>

		<description>Maybe you should look for most effective beliefs instead of most accurate ones. 
We're only humans, we have our limits of how far we can get in  terms of accuracy. There ARE things we can't perceive and there are forces working which we can't understand

Effectiveness on the other hand, is about knowing ourselves, not the reality. Which beliefs could I adapt to get the best results? That is to have a happy, deeply fulfilling life.
Just grit your teeth and look at christianity. It's extremely inaccurate belief system, yet in terms of effectiveness it's a pretty good one. Lots of great people were christians (i.e. John Paul II). 

Why would you even WANT to have an accurate belief system if  not because you believe that it's the most effective one?</description>

		<description>Hey Sean, I just wanted to chime in and say that I can totally relate and I'm not just saying saying that because I just happen to interested in weird things. Its because I've experienced what your talking about (life as a dream). In fact I'm very happy that others feel the same, you're not any less sane than I am. Whether or not that is a compliment I don't know, if I was nuts would I know it?

When you're dreaming everything is effortless, you're not forcing anything, you're just existing, unconcerned with nothing to fear. Life can be the same way and in that way life is like a dream.

For a while now I've been focusing on meditation and self- examination. Trying to free myself from needless emotion baggage it took me a while to figure out was needless. Anyway, in the hours afterwards life takes on the same effortlessness, I just enjoy my five senses and I see my life in a greater context. 

You also begin to life again through a child's eyes. As you described objects seem like metaphors, playfully arbitrary in size and shape. Time begins to stand still. 

My advice to you is is to ride yourself of as many attachments as possible so you can provide yourself more focus towards. psychic development.</description>

		<description>sean i have a theory. no idea how true/wrong it might be but here it is.
there are multiple realities all layered together witch produce what i'll call the 'percived Reality'. The explination of how psionics could function in this jumble of realities is that by learning to control 1 of the planes of reality you can affect the physical plane.
well theres my theory what does every one think?
the oddest part is...
i just came up with this theory as i wrote it &#62;.&#62; so how can it sound so smart? curse you brain! how come you only work good when i'm not trying to do math! &#62;.</description>

		<description>It was interesting that you posted this, for the few weeks I have been obsessing about reality, what it is, what it isn't, what has meaning, etc. I can understand your reluctance to post about your ideas. For me it's like trying to fit an entire ocean of thoughts through a tiny funnel to produce words that are coherent and true, especially when the contents of  that ocean are unclear and disorganised: and even my metaphor makes no sense. What I've come to find is that for now, my poor little brain is too fragile for such ideas, I've thought about them all day and my head hurts:). So although I have no real points to add to your inner discussion, I've got to commend you, and I hope that you continue to try to navigate through it all. I'll be here reading searching for a little clarity.

The timing of this post was perfect, for me anyway, keep it up.

~after thought~ damn I'm lame!</description>
