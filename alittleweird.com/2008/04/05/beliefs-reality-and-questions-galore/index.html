				<p>Ernesto e-mailed me a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of now, I have just finished reading your incomplete sequel to your first E-Book. It left me feeling empty as your new website does not talk about all of the &#8220;Psi&#8221; phenomenon discussed in your first. I wish you could publish a blog in which you finish expressing the ideas of your sequel. Do you still practice Telekinesis and Psi Balls? Do you have any new ideas about how they function with this new broader outlook?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why I don&#8217;t talk about some of my current beliefs is because they sound insane :-P.  Part of me would rather quietly hold on to my bizarre beliefs, and work on them in private, than to express them for everyone to read and criticize.  Keep in mind that a lot of my friends in real life and co-workers read this blog, and my name is attached to every post, so I feel an increased burden to tone things down :-P.</p>
<p>Another reason I don&#8217;t talk about my current understanding is because it&#8217;s not clear.  I don&#8217;t see it clearly in my mind, so I have a hard time explaining it.  I&#8217;ll start to write a sentence, but it won&#8217;t feel correct, so I&#8217;ll try again.  And again.  Ultimately, the problem is that I haven&#8217;t &#8220;figured it out&#8221; in my own head, so I won&#8217;t write about it.</p>
<p>But for this post - sure, I&#8217;ll give it a shot:</p>
<hr />
<p>The biggest belief that I struggle with is that it is my understanding that reality is a dream of some sort.  And I hate saying that because it&#8217;s very clich√©, but I&#8217;ve yet to find any other explanation for what I&#8217;ve observed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined this belief in past posts: <a href="../../../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the things we experience in reality have deeper meaning.  Just like in dreams, where certain metaphors drive the experience, these same metaphors are also the driving forces for what we experience in reality.</p>
<p>The reason why I believe this is because I&#8217;ve been tracking it in my own life.  I have these experiences which are too bizarre to be labeled &#8220;coincidence&#8221;.  I see the metaphors, sometimes while the experience is happening, other times after the fact.  I can predict what&#8217;s going to happen by looking at what the metaphor requires.  A lot of the time I&#8217;m correct (though I will be honest, I am not 100% :-P).</p>
<p>Now of course, the same old arguments can be brought up, that I am biased because I&#8217;m looking for meaning, or that I&#8217;m a sucker, or whatever.  Those arguments don&#8217;t really bother me, because I know I am very honest with myself, and that no one is more critical of my own thoughts than me.  But, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, they do seem like legitimate complaints.  One reason I don&#8217;t like discussing my beliefs is because I&#8217;ll have to argue these worn out positions with people who don&#8217;t care as much as I do.  I&#8217;ve put years of blood sweat and tears into my current beliefs, constantly challenging them from every perspective I can think of, testing reality, forcing myself to drop incorrect beliefs (at the expense of my ego and pride), etc.  It&#8217;s very frustrating to argue with someone who is just trolling around because they have nothing better to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the question that I&#8217;ve yet to answer, is how deep do these metaphors go?  On the surface, it might seem like I&#8217;m just arguing in favor of basic psychology.  I&#8217;ve observed these metaphors manifesting themselves in reality - not just in my own head - so at a minimum I&#8217;m talking about something more than psychology.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m divided between three basic explanations:</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> Reality itself is governed by these metaphors.  Reality <em>is</em> a dream.  Science is derived from this dream.  Examples of this theory are cited in the above links: <a href="../../../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2.</strong> There is an underlying physical reality that is governed by science, but there is a mental reality governed by these metaphors that co-exists with this physical reality.  This would mean that the metaphors are a result of the mind, but that we see manifestations of these metaphors in reality because of large scale unconscious telepathy.  I talk about this idea here: <a href="../../../../2007/11/05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html">Current Understanding of Intention Manifestation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3.</strong> Something I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>If explanation #1 is correct, then reality is a free for all.  There are no rules.  Psionics, and all belief structures, are now easily explained.  This sounds a little outlandish, so I tend to side with #2.</p>
<p>If explanation #2 is correct, then there is a very large question.  How does this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  In this explanation, macro-psychokinesis is not explained.</p>
<p>Most likely, explanation #3 is correct.  But since I&#8217;ve yet to think of it, I don&#8217;t know how it works :-).</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the next question might be: how can we determine which is correct?  What would be a wonderful test that would clear a lot of this up?</p>
<p>Well, winning the lottery.</p>
<p>The lottery is void of mind.  If this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; exists, then the lottery would not be a part of it.  Therefore, intention manifestation wouldn&#8217;t work on the lottery (which is my experience).  So, according to my experiences so far, #2 looks like it might be correct.</p>
<p>However, the problem with #2 is the question of macro-psychokinesis - i.e., how does the &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  Is the physical reality deterministic?  Where does free-will fit into this?</p>
<p>If #2 was completely correct, then you couldn&#8217;t use psychic abilities to win the lottery.  Yet I have already succeeding in breaking the mathematical odds, and other psychics have won the lottery as well. See: <a href="../../../../2007/06/15/psychic-wins-lottery/index.html">Psychic Wins Lottery</a>, <a href="../../../../2007/05/22/i-won/index.html">I Won</a>, <a href="../../../../2007/05/27/i-won-again/index.html">I Won&#8230; Again</a>.</p>
<p>So, #1 doesn&#8217;t feel correct, and my experiences back it up because I failed to win the lottery using intention manifestation.</p>
<p>But, #2 is also incorrect to some extent, because I have succeeded a little bit in winning the lottery, and others have done better than I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, in conclusion&#8230;</p>
<p>In my last eBook, I talked about belief systems, and how we can succeed with psychic abilities using drastically different belief systems.  The question that I had at the end of that eBook was basically: how can that be?</p>
<p>My answer to that question is that reality is some form of dream.  I haven&#8217;t posted a lot on this subject because a lot of the revelations have been very personal as I inspect the metaphors driving my own life.</p>
<p>The next question is: to what extent do these metaphors affect reality?  Either reality <em>is</em> a dream, and physical reality is derived from that dream (#1), OR there is a physical reality, and a mental reality, each governed by different rules (#2).</p>
<p>Judging from my experiences, and my intuition, I believe that #2 is probably more correct.  However, then the question becomes: how is macro-psychokinesis possible?  I.e., how does the mental reality affect the physical reality?</p>
<p>At that point, a good test is to attempt to win the lottery (something completely physical), using mental means (psychic abilities).  This will get me lots of money, play into my own life metaphor, and help answer these glaring questions about how reality works.</p>
<hr />

			<p>I know you&#8217;ve probably heard this one before (but I&#8217;ll say it again for redundancy&#8217;s sake).  What if the world is physically base and the mind is connected to it through certain matter such as √¶ther or ectoplasm (if such materials do actually exist).  I realize you&#8217;ve probably already processed this theory I was just wondering what your view on it was or why it&#8217;s not in that list above.</p>

			<p>Synchronicity, as Jung called it, is an interesting thing to argue about. It is for most purposes the source of anyones believe in a higher power or self awareness. Synchronicity are those events which are unrelated but to the viewer seem connected to each other such as a dream of the previous night happening during the day or following weeks.</p>
<p>The meaning is certainly there to the person who makes the connection but there exists an inability to draw a direct conclusion to show others as proof. The other problem is not unlike how people dismiss most psychics, the psychic throws out plenty of information but the viewer recalled primarily only that which was relevant to themselves. This cognitive association works on the larger scale and can be attributed as a reason for people with an overall sense of guiding of their lives to a specific task or event.</p>
<p>So as much as you play with the question of how these connections come to be, part of you is always asking if the connections are even there at all. Faith seems to be the bridge that allows you to say, yeah okay they do exist.</p>

			<p>It was interesting that you posted this, for the few weeks I have been obsessing about reality, what it is, what it isn&#8217;t, what has meaning, etc. I can understand your reluctance to post about your ideas. For me it&#8217;s like trying to fit an entire ocean of thoughts through a tiny funnel to produce words that are coherent and true, especially when the contents of  that ocean are unclear and disorganised: and even my metaphor makes no sense. What I&#8217;ve come to find is that for now, my poor little brain is too fragile for such ideas, I&#8217;ve thought about them all day and my head hurts:). So although I have no real points to add to your inner discussion, I&#8217;ve got to commend you, and I hope that you continue to try to navigate through it all. I&#8217;ll be here reading searching for a little clarity.</p>
<p>The timing of this post was perfect, for me anyway, keep it up.</p>
<p>~after thought~ damn I&#8217;m lame!</p>

			<p>sean i have a theory. no idea how true/wrong it might be but here it is.<br />
there are multiple realities all layered together witch produce what i&#8217;ll call the &#8216;percived Reality&#8217;. The explination of how psionics could function in this jumble of realities is that by learning to control 1 of the planes of reality you can affect the physical plane.<br />
well theres my theory what does every one think?<br />
the oddest part is&#8230;<br />
i just came up with this theory as i wrote it &gt;.&gt; so how can it sound so smart? curse you brain! how come you only work good when i&#8217;m not trying to do math! &gt;.</p>

			<p>Hey Sean, I just wanted to chime in and say that I can totally relate and I&#8217;m not just saying saying that because I just happen to interested in weird things. Its because I&#8217;ve experienced what your talking about (life as a dream). In fact I&#8217;m very happy that others feel the same, you&#8217;re not any less sane than I am. Whether or not that is a compliment I don&#8217;t know, if I was nuts would I know it?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re dreaming everything is effortless, you&#8217;re not forcing anything, you&#8217;re just existing, unconcerned with nothing to fear. Life can be the same way and in that way life is like a dream.</p>
<p>For a while now I&#8217;ve been focusing on meditation and self- examination. Trying to free myself from needless emotion baggage it took me a while to figure out was needless. Anyway, in the hours afterwards life takes on the same effortlessness, I just enjoy my five senses and I see my life in a greater context. </p>
<p>You also begin to life again through a child&#8217;s eyes. As you described objects seem like metaphors, playfully arbitrary in size and shape. Time begins to stand still. </p>
<p>My advice to you is is to ride yourself of as many attachments as possible so you can provide yourself more focus towards. psychic development.</p>

			<p>Maybe you should look for most effective beliefs instead of most accurate ones.<br />
We&#8217;re only humans, we have our limits of how far we can get in  terms of accuracy. There ARE things we can&#8217;t perceive and there are forces working which we can&#8217;t understand</p>
<p>Effectiveness on the other hand, is about knowing ourselves, not the reality. Which beliefs could I adapt to get the best results? That is to have a happy, deeply fulfilling life.<br />
Just grit your teeth and look at christianity. It&#8217;s extremely inaccurate belief system, yet in terms of effectiveness it&#8217;s a pretty good one. Lots of great people were christians (i.e. John Paul II). </p>
<p>Why would you even WANT to have an accurate belief system if  not because you believe that it&#8217;s the most effective one?</p>

			<p>This post kind of shocks me. Because these are the exact thoughts and ideas I&#8217;ve managed to scrap together last month. Things happening, filled with some sort of meaning. Almost like someone is trying to show me something about myself I didn&#8217;t know before. I&#8217;m not saying god exists or doesn&#8217;t exist (even though I do believe in a higher being), but it sure seems like someone/something like it does. However, it could all just be my imagination or my almost paranoid perception. *checks behind back* <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
Strangely, every time one of these &#8220;metaphors&#8221; for my life occurs, I get a sudden burst of memories popping up randomly in my head. It&#8217;s almost like some kind of &#8220;instant replay&#8221; button is hit. Sometimes, memories that I haven&#8217;t been able to access for a long time; stuff that has long since faded into the unconscious part of my mind.<br />
I don&#8217;t want to go in detail, because a lot of personal things are involved in this. But I can give some rough reference frames. Here&#8217;s a typical event:<br />
For example, I meet someone I associate a certain quality with. And then someone else just &#8220;randomly&#8221; walks by, with me knowing that this person has the exact opposite qualities. Synchronity&#8230; In itself, a rather weird thing. I start comparing these two subconsciously, and an idea/philosophical stuff/whatever pops into my head.<br />
Three seconds later, I manage to recall situations from my life that aren&#8217;t even connected to this event and which I didn&#8217;t know I could still remember.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is this burst of memories. Does it happen to other people too or is it just my own sick mind :-D???</p>

			<p>I believe the mental and physical realities cross and intersect at some points, thus explaining macro-psychokinesis. As scientists have shown, thinking is done in the brain. The brain uses electric and magnetic impulses. Therefore these physical objects affect mental reality. A lot of articles on psionics, some even written by you, have used the fact that the brain sends out waves which could affect large objects such as the pinwheel.</p>

			<p>It seems your beliefs are shared with many others, and it is also the belief of Buddhism ^^.</p>
<p>PK relating to probabilities is real, but the outcome will not effect the reality significantly. Winning a lottery (millions) would completely alter the world that you are in right now, thus the chances of that happening is not that high. Unless it is written in your life, or seemed that it will happen because you did so much good things, it will have a higher chance of happening.</p>
<p>After all, your beliefs are shared with millions if not more people,its good to know.</p>

			<p>beliefs are dangerous. people kill and die for beliefs&#8230;even if they are untrue. Ideas however are chagable and can evolve. Its kinda like the premise of chaos magick&#8230;belief makes the magick&#8230;not the system or anything else. So don&#8217;t take such things so seriously&#8230;otherwise you could end up in a grave situation and end up not being able to put down what you called up&#8230;Thats what i believe anyways.<br />
