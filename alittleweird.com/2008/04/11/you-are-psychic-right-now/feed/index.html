		<description>I think Sean have not overcame the concept of religion yet. The purpose of the post would be to treat psionics like a skill, that's unrelated to a religion. But what is a religion? The core of a religion is its beliefs, you can choose to believe the stories of that religion or not, but what about the ideas? Many religions share the same idea, not only that, governments are derived from religions. What is a religion to me? It is just ideas that we believe is right and can continuously accept it so we can become a better person. Now, I'm pretty sure that some people are well aware psionics is related to some religions. Some religions requires meditation, and through meditation people gained psionic abilities and discovered more about the religious world. Only a person with pure desire of love of everyone and can give up everything they worked for is capable of escaping the reality. Escape it for eternity, that's my belief. Now it is associated with religions, and I wont talk about it anymore =p cuz its just me ^_^

But really, religion can be a skill if you want it to be, I'm not being picky, but it's all about one's perspective, so I do understand your views.

OBE are master level techniques, you only master that by will when you unlock the crown chakra, which is a golden ring similar to a crown around your head when fully awaken.</description>

		<description>To add insult to injury:

"
People with schizotypal personalities often have odd patterns of speech and ramble endlessly on subjects tangent to a topic of conversation. They may dress in peculiar ways and have very strange ways of viewing the world around them. Often they harbor unusual ideas, such as believing in the powers of ESP or a "sixth sense." At times, they believe they can magically influence people's thoughts, actions and emotions.
"
And 

"
For a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, at least five of the following criteria must be met:

 * Incorrect interpretations of events, including a feeling that something innocuous has a direct personal meaning
 * Odd beliefs or magical thinking that's inconsistent with cultural norms
 * Unusual perceptions, including illusions
 * Odd thinking and speech patterns
 * Suspicious or paranoid thoughts, such as the belief that someone's "out to get them"
 * Flat emotions, appearing aloof and isolated
 * Odd, eccentric or peculiar behavior or appearance
 * Lack of close friends or confidants other than relatives
    * Excessive social anxiety that doesn't diminish with familiarity

"

These pieces describe a mental condition called Schizotypal personality disorder.

Gee. I wonder why people are so hesitant to pursue psionic interests publicly?</description>

		<description>that is a possebilety, but isn't magic something entirely different? Or am I mistaken?

ah well, I probably am because on all those sites about magic or "Magick" they use all kinds of things to focus themselves. But how come that not everybody knows about this?</description>

		<description>Or it has been discovered... Merely discredited.

Pop culture has it all in a neat bundle: "Magic".
Make magic seem ridiculous and childish, and you have discredited everything associated with it. And you can associate everything paranormal under that label.</description>

		<description>We can indeed do great things even now, with some training. But what I don't understand is that psionics have never been discoverd. How can it remain hidden with our information based society?</description>

		<description>So is Sean saying that we already are full blown psychics, we just have to sort of "discover" or "unlock" our potential?  Also, I think that humans are capable of doing truly amazing things with psionics, not just randomly, but at will, with ease. I think that there is some kind of major mental block or illusion that is sort keeping us from "freeing our minds", and once we overcome it, moving a psi wheel will be seen as like crawling is to running.</description>

		<description>History as we know it, is full of legends.

Bible alone is full of miracles and supernatural events. However, these are all explained through monoteistic viewpoint and thus, only God can make "good mircales".

Ancient Egypt had lots of superstition in its culture.
According to recent studies, many people attempted or used "spells" or rituals in order to accomplish goals during the Ancient Greece period.

Somehow the magical thinking seems to be somewhat natural among humans. There are few (if any?) atheistic and uncivilized cultures around the world. Tribal life and rituals / worship tend to go hand in hand.

After the Catholic church began losing its influence around 14th century, one belief after another was challenged. Earth was round and rotating around Sun. Soon technological achievements began to offer surefire ways to produce "mircales". Boats swim up the river against the wind. Hollow pipes can kill people hundreds of yards away. Machines can fly like birds.  People can talk even if separated by a huge  Ocean.

Only thing I cannot understand is the fact that Cold War seems to have produced tons of psionic reports and materials. Alas, the actual results are slim and none. 

Sure, people can occasionaly do a accurate remote viewing, or affect a random number generator with thought alone, but come on! They just dropped the ball once the Cold war ended. 
PEAR. labs were closed down too not long ago.

The biggest wonder of psionics is the fact that it has remained hidden this far. And is likely to stay this way for a long time...</description>

		<description>When I write "flelonies" instead of "felonies", it would be nice to have a spell-check button to eliminate all those horrible embarrasing mistakes from my long posts =P</description>
