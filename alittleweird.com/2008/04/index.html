<p>Per request of <a href="../../forums.php@cmd=thread&amp;tid=278.html">SheepKing</a>, I decided to make game based on influencing my <a href="../../geiger-game.php.html">Geiger Counter</a>!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Hidden behind the idea of &#8220;practice&#8221; and &#8220;success&#8221; is this idea of separation.</p>
<p>If we want to become a great baseball player, then we clearly need practice.  Becoming a great baseball player takes some natural talent, but like other skills, it mostly takes dedication, training, and repetition.</p>
<p>A lot of times I will equate psychic abilities to other normal skills.  I might say that, just like becoming a great baseball player, if you want to learn to be psychic, then you need to practice it as if it were any other skill.  Don&#8217;t treat it special.  Don&#8217;t think of it as something mystical.  Treat it as if you were learning anything else.</p>
<p>I like this method of instruction for a lot of reasons.  The main reason I like to equate psychic abilities to other normal skills is because it breaks down the association between psychic abilities and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>It would be silly of me to be religious about playing baseball.  While some great baseball players are certainly religious, and some might even claim that their religion has helped them become so great - one thing is certain: You don&#8217;t learn to hit homeruns by closing your eyes and believing in some mystical force.  You hit homeruns by practicing.  Maybe religion plays a role in motivation, but the actual <em>skill</em> needs to be developed, and the only way to do that is to practice.</p>
<p>Likewise, when I talk about psychic abilities being like any other skill, my real goal is to break this mental association between psychic abilities and personal religious beliefs.  I might instruct someone to treat psychic abilities like any other skill, but what I&#8217;m really instructing them to do is to drop their insistence of explaining something unknown using religious ideas.</p>
<p>There is a slight problem with this though.  Psychic abilities <em>aren&#8217;t</em> like other normal skills.</p>
<p>Normal skills need to be learned.  The skill is external to yourself, and through training and practice, you slowly learn to perform the task correctly.  The information on how to perform the task is external to yourself.  Someone <em>else</em> created the game &#8220;baseball&#8221;.  You must learn what <em>they</em> created.  The information is inherently external.</p>
<p>Psychic abilities are not external.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.  This is where the analogy breaks down.  At this point, psychic abilities are not like any other skill.  They are not something created by someone <em>else</em>, that we must learn the rules to.  They are inside ourselves, at this very moment.  We are psychic creatures - right now.</p>
<p>We are not all baseball-playing creatures right now.  Some of us learn to play baseball, others don&#8217;t.  But we are ALL psychic creatures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to think of psychic abilities like any other skill in order to break our addiction of explaining unknown things using religion.  However: once that addiction is correctly broken, we must deal with the reality of the situation.  Psychic abilities are not like other skills.  Normal skills are external to ourselves - something that we must engage with the world around us to learn.  Psychic abilities are inherently internal.</p>
<p>Put another way: a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest baseball player of all time, must at some point learn the rules of baseball.  But a newborn child, whose destined to be the greatest psychic of all time, doesn&#8217;t have to learn anything.  In fact, they may already BE the greatest psychic at the moment they are born.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself looking externally for answers on &#8220;how to be an awesome psychic&#8221;, remember that you are psychic right now - it is something inside of you at this very moment.  The real question is at what depth do you understand your own true nature.</p>

					<p>Ernesto e-mailed me a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of now, I have just finished reading your incomplete sequel to your first E-Book. It left me feeling empty as your new website does not talk about all of the &#8220;Psi&#8221; phenomenon discussed in your first. I wish you could publish a blog in which you finish expressing the ideas of your sequel. Do you still practice Telekinesis and Psi Balls? Do you have any new ideas about how they function with this new broader outlook?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why I don&#8217;t talk about some of my current beliefs is because they sound insane :-P.  Part of me would rather quietly hold on to my bizarre beliefs, and work on them in private, than to express them for everyone to read and criticize.  Keep in mind that a lot of my friends in real life and co-workers read this blog, and my name is attached to every post, so I feel an increased burden to tone things down :-P.</p>
<p>Another reason I don&#8217;t talk about my current understanding is because it&#8217;s not clear.  I don&#8217;t see it clearly in my mind, so I have a hard time explaining it.  I&#8217;ll start to write a sentence, but it won&#8217;t feel correct, so I&#8217;ll try again.  And again.  Ultimately, the problem is that I haven&#8217;t &#8220;figured it out&#8221; in my own head, so I won&#8217;t write about it.</p>
<p>But for this post - sure, I&#8217;ll give it a shot:</p>
<hr />
<p>The biggest belief that I struggle with is that it is my understanding that reality is a dream of some sort.  And I hate saying that because it&#8217;s very cliché, but I&#8217;ve yet to find any other explanation for what I&#8217;ve observed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined this belief in past posts: <a href="../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the things we experience in reality have deeper meaning.  Just like in dreams, where certain metaphors drive the experience, these same metaphors are also the driving forces for what we experience in reality.</p>
<p>The reason why I believe this is because I&#8217;ve been tracking it in my own life.  I have these experiences which are too bizarre to be labeled &#8220;coincidence&#8221;.  I see the metaphors, sometimes while the experience is happening, other times after the fact.  I can predict what&#8217;s going to happen by looking at what the metaphor requires.  A lot of the time I&#8217;m correct (though I will be honest, I am not 100% :-P).</p>
<p>Now of course, the same old arguments can be brought up, that I am biased because I&#8217;m looking for meaning, or that I&#8217;m a sucker, or whatever.  Those arguments don&#8217;t really bother me, because I know I am very honest with myself, and that no one is more critical of my own thoughts than me.  But, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, they do seem like legitimate complaints.  One reason I don&#8217;t like discussing my beliefs is because I&#8217;ll have to argue these worn out positions with people who don&#8217;t care as much as I do.  I&#8217;ve put years of blood sweat and tears into my current beliefs, constantly challenging them from every perspective I can think of, testing reality, forcing myself to drop incorrect beliefs (at the expense of my ego and pride), etc.  It&#8217;s very frustrating to argue with someone who is just trolling around because they have nothing better to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the question that I&#8217;ve yet to answer, is how deep do these metaphors go?  On the surface, it might seem like I&#8217;m just arguing in favor of basic psychology.  I&#8217;ve observed these metaphors manifesting themselves in reality - not just in my own head - so at a minimum I&#8217;m talking about something more than psychology.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m divided between three basic explanations:</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> Reality itself is governed by these metaphors.  Reality <em>is</em> a dream.  Science is derived from this dream.  Examples of this theory are cited in the above links: <a href="../../2007/07/29/everything-is-meaningful/index.html">Everything is Meaningful</a>, and <a href="../../2007/06/30/i-am-probably-insane/index.html">I am Probably Insane</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2.</strong> There is an underlying physical reality that is governed by science, but there is a mental reality governed by these metaphors that co-exists with this physical reality.  This would mean that the metaphors are a result of the mind, but that we see manifestations of these metaphors in reality because of large scale unconscious telepathy.  I talk about this idea here: <a href="../../2007/11/05/current-understanding-of-intention-manifestation/index.html">Current Understanding of Intention Manifestation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3.</strong> Something I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>If explanation #1 is correct, then reality is a free for all.  There are no rules.  Psionics, and all belief structures, are now easily explained.  This sounds a little outlandish, so I tend to side with #2.</p>
<p>If explanation #2 is correct, then there is a very large question.  How does this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  In this explanation, macro-psychokinesis is not explained.</p>
<p>Most likely, explanation #3 is correct.  But since I&#8217;ve yet to think of it, I don&#8217;t know how it works :-).</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the next question might be: how can we determine which is correct?  What would be a wonderful test that would clear a lot of this up?</p>
<p>Well, winning the lottery.</p>
<p>The lottery is void of mind.  If this &#8220;mental reality&#8221; exists, then the lottery would not be a part of it.  Therefore, intention manifestation wouldn&#8217;t work on the lottery (which is my experience).  So, according to my experiences so far, #2 looks like it might be correct.</p>
<p>However, the problem with #2 is the question of macro-psychokinesis - i.e., how does the &#8220;mental reality&#8221; affect the physical reality?  Is the physical reality deterministic?  Where does free-will fit into this?</p>
<p>If #2 was completely correct, then you couldn&#8217;t use psychic abilities to win the lottery.  Yet I have already succeeding in breaking the mathematical odds, and other psychics have won the lottery as well. See: <a href="../../2007/06/15/psychic-wins-lottery/index.html">Psychic Wins Lottery</a>, <a href="../../2007/05/22/i-won/index.html">I Won</a>, <a href="../../2007/05/27/i-won-again/index.html">I Won&#8230; Again</a>.</p>
<p>So, #1 doesn&#8217;t feel correct, and my experiences back it up because I failed to win the lottery using intention manifestation.</p>
<p>But, #2 is also incorrect to some extent, because I have succeeded a little bit in winning the lottery, and others have done better than I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, in conclusion&#8230;</p>
<p>In my last eBook, I talked about belief systems, and how we can succeed with psychic abilities using drastically different belief systems.  The question that I had at the end of that eBook was basically: how can that be?</p>
<p>My answer to that question is that reality is some form of dream.  I haven&#8217;t posted a lot on this subject because a lot of the revelations have been very personal as I inspect the metaphors driving my own life.</p>
<p>The next question is: to what extent do these metaphors affect reality?  Either reality <em>is</em> a dream, and physical reality is derived from that dream (#1), OR there is a physical reality, and a mental reality, each governed by different rules (#2).</p>
<p>Judging from my experiences, and my intuition, I believe that #2 is probably more correct.  However, then the question becomes: how is macro-psychokinesis possible?  I.e., how does the mental reality affect the physical reality?</p>
<p>At that point, a good test is to attempt to win the lottery (something completely physical), using mental means (psychic abilities).  This will get me lots of money, play into my own life metaphor, and help answer these glaring questions about how reality works.</p>
<hr />
