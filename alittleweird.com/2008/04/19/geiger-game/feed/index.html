		<description>Who knew that geiger counters could be so.. FRIKKEN AWESOME? Let's do it again!

We got the counter up to 21, then later it dropped to 3. Shortly after that we hung it up at 19 for a while. Very neat little game we have, here. I'm still experimenting with different visualizations to do different things (shield colors/shapes, atmospheric conditions, miniature suns, electrical overload, and blue bombs!).</description>

		<description>Just had an idea to add a gabbly chat to it... the same chat program that was used on the PsiPog forums a while back.  No extra coding on my part!  Problem solved :-).</description>

		<description>cinderwild - is your PC clock set correctly?  Correct timezone?  The calculation is based on what's called the Unix Timestamp, between my computer, and your computer.

Glad everyone else likes the game!  I want to add a "How many people are playing right now" statistic.  I'll do that who-knows-when :-P.</description>

		<description>Yes once it is confirmed that we are able to affect the electromagnetic spectrum I can see the forum thread:

Psi; Does it cause cancer? hahah

Also; If you get some good results: I'd say over 30; Screen shot it and post on the forums! (reduce that image size/edit that sheeet. We don't want to use up tons of bandwidth)</description>

		<description>This geiger theory is interesting too...

Are we affecting the device directly, or is the psionic effect  causing electromagnetic radiation that can be measured?

I feel this is the important one. If psi can be connected to electromagnetic radiation, many questions could be answered.</description>
