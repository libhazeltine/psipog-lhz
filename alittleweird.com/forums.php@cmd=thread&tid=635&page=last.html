First, because this has been done a million times. Every noob that comes along, every one of them tries to start thier own site. As if there isnt already enough psi sites out there already. <br />
<br />
Second, 9 times out of 10 the noob starting the site has no idea what thier doing, and put a bunch of fluff on it. They also try to teach things on thier site that they have never done before, like flaring. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the site never stays. It lasts maybe a few weeks, two months at the most, then its gone. <br />

Really, I dont know how to make you get it. Your just like every other little kid who tries to start his own psi site, thinking he&#039;s so special.</div>

		<div id="post_12773" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">VampiricKody-For reasons unbeknownst to  me, reading back on your past posts, you always gave off a vibe of extreme annoyance. <br />
<br />
Now, looking at this, I know why.<br />
<br />
First of all, Trick is right. You lack the credibility to strike out on your own and create your own site. <br />
<br />
I realize the magnitism of the concept. The way it must feel to have your own site and watch it prosper under your guidance.<br />
<br />
However, one cannot follow one who cannot lead. You cannot offer guidance, for you have none to give. You lack the experience. <br />
<br />
And to be perfectly blunt...You truly do give off a vibe that screams &quot;Young!&quot;. Now, we all know that age does not equal maturity. Unfortunately, you aren&#039;t exactly mature enough for this either. <br />
<br />
Openminded, I went to your site. I was rather disappointed. You have good ideas going, but you have unneccessary sections on your forums. The descriptions of each forum are rather juvenile. Not to mention I find it EXTREMELY difficult to take you seriously when you have spelling errors all over the forums, even in the titles of the different sections. <br />
<br />
This brings me to another point. As Trick pointed out, there are more than enough psionic communities. However, most of them are dead. You haven&#039;t succeeded in creating a new site, you&#039;ve succeeded in creating a site that will be just as dead as the rest of them and has further spread out the decay among the sites.<br />
<br />
A pebble cannot a temple make.<br />
<br />
The obvious way to go about this is to spread awareness about the CURRENT sites. I am focusing on this one in particular. Focus only on those who seem TRULY interested. Idiots are unavoidable, but you can certainly cut down on the amount of them. So once this forum is active once more, the other sites and forums can be introduced. And then the people will trickle into other forums. Soon all the sites will be active once more.<br />
<br />
This is not an overnight process. <br />
<br />
Another thing. <br />
<br />
You are closeminded to the different theories and aspects involved with psionics. I have watched you tell others you reject their ideas for your own. One thing that is absolutely important in psionics is to keep an open mind. You cannot say &quot;I&#039;m right, you&#039;re wrong&quot;. You can DISAGREE but you cannot DISREGARD.<br />
<br />
Therefore, you would be teaching others inadequately. <br />
<br />
Lack of maturity+Lack of experience+Lack of an open mind+whatever other negative factors are one with you=Bad idea to make a site.<br />
<br />
I could not follow you, VampiricKody. <br />
<br />
You have a long way to go before you are mature enough for the task you&#039;ve set yourself to.<br />
<br />
You don&#039;t have to give up on the idea forever, just put it off for now.<br />
<br />
You are not ready.<br />

I am to be honest, fairly new to psionics and just wanted to be a noob helping noobs, however I cannot do this. What I&#039;ve been doing is giving people a reideration of articles from other sites, which is indeed wrong. I think what I&#039;ll do is not shut down the site, but keep it there, for later. I may later on introduce my own ways of energy manipulation, my own beliefs etc. Most of which I&#039;ve made my own threads about here asking if they&#039;re ethical. So I guess I&#039;ll just add to i overtime a little bit every once in a while til I&#039;m fairly experienced.<br />

Well...You may be borderline copy infringement. I&#039;m not going to say 100% on that, just keep in mind that you might want to ask permission before you take information from somebody else&#039;s work.<br />

If you introduce YOUR OWN WAYS, be sure to tell people that it is YOUR way, that it is not the only way, that there are other ways. You want to help people. Not hinder. <br />
