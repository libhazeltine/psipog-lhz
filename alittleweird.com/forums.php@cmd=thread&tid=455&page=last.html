		<div id="post_9978" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hi, all, I&#039;m new to this site, but not to psionics. I have been studying it on and off for about 7 to 8 years now, but am only advanced in theory, not practice. It&#039;s been more of a hobby than a life journey of mine. <br />
<br />
However, I like to try little things and practice and such. I am also very spiritual and what I believe is ultimately linked to psionics and energy.<br />
<br />
Ever since I started studying psionics, I&#039;ve had a particular problem with visualization. When I read an article explaining a scene to visualize or a story describing a situation or even start daydreaming with my eyes open, I can literally see what I&#039;m visualizing clearly, but in the background.<br />
<br />
However, when I close my eyes and try to visualize something without another &#039;mind process&#039; working in the foreground, it doesn&#039;t work nearly as well. The image is distorted and blurred and feels very unreal. When my eyes are open and I&#039;m mostly thinking about something else, I find that my visualizations, though being in the back of my mind, appear as much sharper and clearer images.<br />
<br />
This gets annoying because while I can &#039;see&#039; things clearer with my eyes open, I can&#039;t -focus- on them as much as I would be able to if I set everything aside, closed my eyes, and visualized something. But when I try, everything is blurry and feels very unreal. Any ideas on how I can overcome this?</div>

		<div id="post_9979" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Meditation can be helpful in getting yourself to a point where you can just sit down and visualize. However, since you probably don&#039;t want to wait for that to happen, I would suggest that along with daily meditation you should try to set everything aside, keep your eyes open, and visualize.<br />

Some people enter trance like states just from starring at a solid color - like looking out over a field covered in smooth snow, or the sky with no clouds.  You might even get results by looking at a solid wall.  Try it out.<br />

		<div id="post_10092" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Apologies for the late reply, I don&#039;t have much time to be visiting here daily :(<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestions. Akio and Sean, keeping my eyes open helps, but I&#039;d really prefer to be able to do it with my eyes closed. I really feel like I&#039;d be able to immerse myself in the visualization more if I was not looking at anything in particular. <br />
<br />
Chillpill, I normally visualize people I know and places I&#039;ve been. I also visualize places I&#039;ve written about and usually have a knack for being able to clearly imagine places from books and such. I don&#039;t think that visualizing unfamiliar things is the problem because most of what I visualize is very familiar to me.<br />
<br />
I tried visualizing something with my eyes closed with meditation music playing quietly in the background and it seemed to help. I&#039;m starting to think that I have to have something to kind of keep my mind on there besides whatever I&#039;m visualizing. Not sure why this happens, hopefully after a while I won&#039;t have to have a second thought process running to visualize, but for now music might be a fair solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div>
