I`ve been reading a lot about the AOBE and many people say that in an AOBE another person or spirit can enter your body which can make you lose possesion of it.<br />

Is that true?<br />
Can AOBE be dangerous in any way?<br />

<br />
interesting.. I think haven&#039;t heard of AOBEs.<br />
Where did you read about them?<br />
From your post, it seems like it&#039;s quite dangerous.<br />
<br />
The closest to entering some other body is the two dreams I&#039;ve had:<br />
<br />
In one, I was testing a new body that I had created.<br />
<br />
In the other I accidentally woke up in a wrong body. Looked around for a while, until I was pushed out of the body to return to my original container. It was interesting, how the memories faded just before entering and after leaving a body.</div>

Imagine if two people in the same room had an OBE..But, instead of flying around or whatever, they both purposely went into the OTHER persons body, instead of returning to thier own? </div>

The dream thing to me just sounds like a regular old dream, but could you explain it a bit more. Maybe I am not quite understanding it completely. but, even if it was a dream, most people have  not been able to completely define a dream in the first place. So, you could have switched bodies with someone while you were sleeping.<br />

That thing doesnt sever before death and guess what, its probably impossible for a soul to attach itself to a body after death to live within. I dont say its impossible for a soul to manipulate a dead body but to &quot;drive&quot; inside of a body it must be alive.<br />
<br />
That would explain why you can reside a body that you created or that was created without any souls inside to the purpose of being a public vessel :P<br />
Alot of sources say obes are dangerous for this and this reason.<br />
Its all bullshit, people might say I almost didnt come back!!<br />
Yeah right, always almost. The most dangerous thing in there is fear.<br />
So if you have heart problems yeah you may get a heart attack.<br />
Other than  that, worse is youre going to be too scared to go back.<br />
Don&#039;t be scared, you wont die and you wont get lost.</div>
