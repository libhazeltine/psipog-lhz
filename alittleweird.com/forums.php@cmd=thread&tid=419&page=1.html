Every living or non-living object is composed of tiny particles of matter. These particles, according to Physics, are in constant motion. This motion creates energy, which covers all objects. This is what we refer to as the Aura.<br />
<br />
In labs people have taken pictures of the aura around the human body using Kirlian photography (see  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography</a> for more details.)<br />

Through the proper techniques, Anyone can see the aura...ofcourse, just seeing the aura isn&#039;t a psychic ability, but rather a training of the human eye itself, so the technique tends not to vary to much.<br />

Maybe it&#039;s a good idea to start about the basics of the aura, so there won&#039;t be a lot of questions like that.<br />
Anyway, I&#039;ll help you where I can, I&#039;ve got a little experience when it comes to aura&#039;s and healing too :)<br />

		<div id="post_9226" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Okay, It is time for my first lesson. So everybody knows, I will try to post a lesson once a day, granted, It may stretch on a little longer because of question.<br />
<br />
zephr, your question should be answered in my first lesson, please let me know if you still have problems after this post and I can try to help you. Keep in mind that the answers I give are only as good as the questions, so elaborate.<br />
<br />
First Lesson: Aura Sight, Techniques and meanings.<br />
<br />
Introduction, Aura sight is the human ability to See the phenomenon of the aura, the energy field that surrounds and is part of every body of the universe. My goals for this lesson are to teach you different techniques for seeing the aura, giving training excersises on how to improve aura sight to a point where you can use it without much effort on your part, as well as to explain some meanings of different aspects of the aura, such as colour.<br />
<br />
Part I, Techniques of aurasight.<br />
<br />
Now, we&#039;ve made it to part one, techniques. To be honest, I&#039;ve only seen one technique for aura sight, all it really required is a bit of practice.<br />
<br />
To show you this technique, I am going to have you use your aura as a start. The first step of this technique is to get infront of a mirror, so your face is in veiw. What you want to do from here is just stare at one position in the mirror, I ussually use my third eye/forehead as a point of reference, but it doesn&#039;t matter. while staring, just let your eyes relax, don&#039;t force them to do anything, as you would when you are reading. after a while, you will start to see a colour around the edges of your body from your peripheral vision, RESIST ANY URGE TO LOOK AT IT!!! When your eyes move they will automatically adjust themselves and you won&#039;t be able to see it. <br />
<br />
I am extremely well gifted with aura vision, not because of my sensitivity level or anything, just because I have learned to control my eyes very well (I can control the muscles that cause your eyes to dialate and contract). The more you learn to control your own eyes the easier aura sight becomes, which leads me to the next part.<br />
<br />
Part II, Training exercises.<br />
<br />
I have seen many training exercises on the web, some of them are good, some are just crap and babble (sounds like politics!). <br />
<br />
The best one is an eye training excercise that teaches you how to control the muscles in the human eye, as well as teaching you how to creat neutral dominancy (where neither the right or left eye is dominate over one another.) the link to which is below.<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://thiaoouba.com/images/cross.gif" target="_blank">http://thiaoouba.com/images/cross.gif</a><br />
<br />
This exercise aims to stimulate the communication between both hemispheres of the brain, thereby increasing the &quot;processing power&quot; needed to see Auras. Place the picture in Fig 2 about 1 meter in front of you. Stretch your hand forward so that one of your fingers is between and underneath circles.<br />
<br />
Change focus on the tip of your finger and overlook the circles. You should see 4 circles. Then aim to overlap the middle two to see ONE CIRCLE WITH A WHITE CROSS on top of your finger, in the middle between the two. Seeing the cross is the evidence, that the left hemisphere of the brain (connected to the right eye) is communicating with the right hemisphere (connected to the left eye).<br />
<br />
This exercise turns out to be extremely beneficial: 5 minutes of it seems to double the size of the electro-photonic aura as recorded by bioelectrography.<br />
<br />
The cross will initially float and seem unstable. Experiment with the distance from your finger to your eyes to achieve a perfect cross. You gain a significant benefit after 3-5 minutes of maintaining a perfectly balanced cross, preferably without blinking, but a magic duration seems to be 45 minutes of concentration at the time, which is said to make a REAL difference to your mental and auric abilities.<br />
<br />
Gradually, with practice you should be able to achieve and maintain the cross without the finger. While maintaining the cross try to become aware of the other 2 circles as well as everything around using your peripheral vision. You should see Auric colors around the colored circles above with your peripheral vision. When you can analyze surroundings using your peripheral vision, without loosing the cross (and the concentration), you are ready to see and read auras.<br />
<br />
Part III, Meanings of the Aura.<br />
<br />
In this section, I won&#039;t go into to much detail here except to list a few meanings of the colours off of the sight in which I learned to read aura&#039;s<br />
<br />
Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura <br />
(colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors):<br />
<br />
Purple: indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;flames&quot;, indicating truly spiritual thoughts.<br />
<br />
Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author of &quot;Thiaoouba Prophecy&quot;, frequently glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions from the public.<br />
<br />
Turquoise: indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized personality, capable of projection, influencing other people. People with turquoise strong point in their Aura can do many things simultaneously and are good organizers. They feel bored when forced to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with turquoise Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their team rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought is a thought about organizing and influencing others.<br />
<br />
Green: restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the better the healer. They also love gardening and usually have a &quot;green hand&quot; - anything grows for them. Being in a presence of a person with a strong and green Aura is a very peaceful and restful experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing.<br />
<br />
Yellow: joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high spiritual development. A signature of a spiritual teacher. Do not accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does not have such a yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed when highly active, a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it, surrounding the entire head. Yellow thought indicates a moment of joy and contentment.<br />
<br />
Orange: uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a strong point, it usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then becomes gold, indicating not only a spiritual teacher, but a powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of demonstrating his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about exercising power or a desire to control people.<br />
<br />
Red: materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.<br />
<br />
Pink (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a clean pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we perceive) with red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence. The most advanced people have not only a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in the Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink color in the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a temporary thought, never as a strong point in the Aura.<br />
<br />
Meaning of Dirty colors: <br />
(colors appearing darker than background more like a smoke than a glow)<br />
<br />
Brown: unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating spirituality.<br />
<br />
Gray: dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions, presence of a dark side of personality.<br />
<br />
Sulfur (color of a mustard): pain or lack of ease, anger<br />
<br />
White: serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, rather than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic colors). It is impossible to &quot;tune&quot; the noise to an orchestra playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates a lack of harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is harmonious. This harmony comes in discrete vibration &quot;tones&quot; or harmonics, partially described by the modern quantum physics. <br />
Several hours before the death, the Aura becomes white, and greatly increases in intensity. For this reason in most cultures &quot;death&quot; is depicted in WHITE (not black), because in the past, people could actually see a white Aura before death. It seems that our ancestors knew much more than we are prepared to admit.<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
note; I am still studying the meaning of the white aura, It seems to be that it is like an ultraviolet aura of sorts, meaning that it is not really &quot;out of tune&quot;, but rather a very high vibration. I think it may still indicate an imbalance, and I still think it represents imbalance, but rather than being out of tune, it is just the effect of an extremely high vibration of the aura.<br />
<br />
I was watching a show this week that touched on the aura, and I heard the little girl in the story mention that those with a very purple aura are sick (she then mentioned that the last man she saw with a purple aura died of a heart attack 3 days later). This is what sparked the Idea of the white aura being ultra violet. to be more precise, before death, I think it is safe to say that we have a slowely elevating aura, increasing in vibrational levels until it hits white. There is more study to do on this subect before I can say anything conclusive.<br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9226">Okay, It is time for my first lesson. So everybody knows, I will try to post a lesson once a day, granted, It may stretch on a little longer because of question.

zephr, your question should be answered in my first lesson, please let me know if you still have problems after this post and I can try to help you. Keep in mind that the answers I give are only as good as the questions, so elaborate.

First Lesson: Aura Sight, Techniques and meanings.

Introduction, Aura sight is the human ability to See the phenomenon of the aura, the energy field that surrounds and is part of every body of the universe. My goals for this lesson are to teach you different techniques for seeing the aura, giving training excersises on how to improve aura sight to a point where you can use it without much effort on your part, as well as to explain some meanings of different aspects of the aura, such as colour.

Part I, Techniques of aurasight.

Now, we&#039;ve made it to part one, techniques. To be honest, I&#039;ve only seen one technique for aura sight, all it really required is a bit of practice.

To show you this technique, I am going to have you use your aura as a start. The first step of this technique is to get infront of a mirror, so your face is in veiw. What you want to do from here is just stare at one position in the mirror, I ussually use my third eye/forehead as a point of reference, but it doesn&#039;t matter. while staring, just let your eyes relax, don&#039;t force them to do anything, as you would when you are reading. after a while, you will start to see a colour around the edges of your body from your peripheral vision, RESIST ANY URGE TO LOOK AT IT!!! When your eyes move they will automatically adjust themselves and you won&#039;t be able to see it. 

I am extremely well gifted with aura vision, not because of my sensitivity level or anything, just because I have learned to control my eyes very well (I can control the muscles that cause your eyes to dialate and contract). The more you learn to control your own eyes the easier aura sight becomes, which leads me to the next part.

Part II, Training exercises.

I have seen many training exercises on the web, some of them are good, some are just crap and babble (sounds like politics!). 

The best one is an eye training excercise that teaches you how to control the muscles in the human eye, as well as teaching you how to creat neutral dominancy (where neither the right or left eye is dominate over one another.) the link to which is below.

http://thiaoouba.com/images/cross.gif

This exercise aims to stimulate the communication between both hemispheres of the brain, thereby increasing the &quot;processing power&quot; needed to see Auras. Place the picture in Fig 2 about 1 meter in front of you. Stretch your hand forward so that one of your fingers is between and underneath circles.

Change focus on the tip of your finger and overlook the circles. You should see 4 circles. Then aim to overlap the middle two to see ONE CIRCLE WITH A WHITE CROSS on top of your finger, in the middle between the two. Seeing the cross is the evidence, that the left hemisphere of the brain (connected to the right eye) is communicating with the right hemisphere (connected to the left eye).

This exercise turns out to be extremely beneficial: 5 minutes of it seems to double the size of the electro-photonic aura as recorded by bioelectrography.

The cross will initially float and seem unstable. Experiment with the distance from your finger to your eyes to achieve a perfect cross. You gain a significant benefit after 3-5 minutes of maintaining a perfectly balanced cross, preferably without blinking, but a magic duration seems to be 45 minutes of concentration at the time, which is said to make a REAL difference to your mental and auric abilities.

Gradually, with practice you should be able to achieve and maintain the cross without the finger. While maintaining the cross try to become aware of the other 2 circles as well as everything around using your peripheral vision. You should see Auric colors around the colored circles above with your peripheral vision. When you can analyze surroundings using your peripheral vision, without loosing the cross (and the concentration), you are ready to see and read auras.

Part III, Meanings of the Aura.

In this section, I won&#039;t go into to much detail here except to list a few meanings of the colours off of the sight in which I learned to read aura&#039;s

Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura 
(colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors):

Purple: indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;flames&quot;, indicating truly spiritual thoughts.

Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author of &quot;Thiaoouba Prophecy&quot;, frequently glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions from the public.

Turquoise: indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized personality, capable of projection, influencing other people. People with turquoise strong point in their Aura can do many things simultaneously and are good organizers. They feel bored when forced to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with turquoise Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their team rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought is a thought about organizing and influencing others.

Green: restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the better the healer. They also love gardening and usually have a &quot;green hand&quot; - anything grows for them. Being in a presence of a person with a strong and green Aura is a very peaceful and restful experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing.

Yellow: joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high spiritual development. A signature of a spiritual teacher. Do not accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does not have such a yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed when highly active, a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it, surrounding the entire head. Yellow thought indicates a moment of joy and contentment.

Orange: uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a strong point, it usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then becomes gold, indicating not only a spiritual teacher, but a powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of demonstrating his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about exercising power or a desire to control people.

Red: materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.

Pink (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a clean pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we perceive) with red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence. The most advanced people have not only a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in the Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink color in the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a temporary thought, never as a strong point in the Aura.

Meaning of Dirty colors: 
(colors appearing darker than background more like a smoke than a glow)

Brown: unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating spirituality.

Gray: dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions, presence of a dark side of personality.

Sulfur (color of a mustard): pain or lack of ease, anger

White: serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, rather than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic colors). It is impossible to &quot;tune&quot; the noise to an orchestra playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates a lack of harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is harmonious. This harmony comes in discrete vibration &quot;tones&quot; or harmonics, partially described by the modern quantum physics.

I didn&#039;t understand you explaination of the training with the two circles. For some reason it all seemed to bled together probibly because you were being to specific. Is there any way to make it....simpiler? Maybe just a brief over veiw of what you need to do. <br />

The Idea that the circles fade between eachother is just showing you which eye is dominate t that point, the idea is to try and balance this dominancy between the two and create a full image. <br />

I only use the method from time to time, but it is very effective nonetheless. <br />

		<div id="post_9280" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The effectiveness of the image technique might be dependent upon screen resolution (optimal sitting distance was covered, but resolution modifies the point of reference).<br />
<br />
Perhaps I can lighten up some of the confusion. I think the technique Akio is trying to suggest is like looking at a autostereogram( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram</a>) (magic eye poster). Mainly that you&#039;d want to have the point between circles always as the center but relax your eyes so that you&#039;d be focused on say the wall behind your monitor, in line with that point. (For an Illustration of the idea follow the link and look under simulated 3d perception)<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know that it has much to do with auras, other than the optical illusion it might create. As far as the mirror thing, I&#039;ll try that out tomorrow.</div>
