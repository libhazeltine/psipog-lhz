		<div id="post_8390" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Thankyou Wandering wolf, without your post, This Thread might have just be dragged through hell and back with this argument. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Condescending, I want to Apologize to you SheepKing for getting annoyed with you, I regret making the last two comments to you, and in genneral just putting myself of as a Stuck up Ass.<br />
<br />
I want to make it Clear to both of you that every post I make is going off the Idea that everything I have studied thus far and everything I ever will study must be true. None of what I say is Directly based on fact, although it is based on the Concept of Fact. <br />
<br />
If you want me to explain something more, on any subject, how I developed my concepts and Ideas, why I feel in such a way, etc. Just ask, I believe firmly that if someone doesn&#039;t have the Desire to Learn, He&#039;s not worth teaching. (not that I&#039;m trying to &quot;teach&quot; you, but i&#039;m sureyou get the Idea.) <br />
<br />
This, however, is a single fact I follow. I seek a Higher answer, and thus I must adapt my concept of reality to encompass every one&#039;s concepts.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t explain that any better than I have. I know it&#039;s Vague, but there is no other explanation to give.<br />
<br />
If you want me to present something in a different way than I have before, I will take the time to do it, just ask me a specific question and I&#039;ll give a specific answer.<br />
<br />
Please Forgive me SheepKing, I don&#039;t in any way mean to offend you (with the exception of the last two ending comments on the previous posts, but I apologize for those as well). I think the Best thing we could do to resolve this is try the best we can to open the lines of communication. Let&#039;s try not to be Korea here, I don&#039;t want to fight, I want to make Progress.</div>

I am surprised that it worked out so well. I was a little worried that it wouldn&#039;t be enough to soften the blow. I&#039;m glad that I was able to help. I&#039;m also glad to see that we really do share a few things in common.<br />
<br />
Akio, I just have one last thing to say to you for now. What you are about to read is simply for your own benefit and is not intended to be condescending or mocking. If there were a private messaging feature, I would have sent the following to you via a private message:<br />
<br />
The word &quot;exlination&quot; is spelled &quot;explanation&quot;. This is of course, assuming that you were not aware of it. If you type it like that simply because it is faster and easier then I apologize for pointing this out. I just can&#039;t stand around and see you do this to yourself. I feel that others could be laughing at you behind their computer screens because of it, so I felt that I had to do this.<br />

*Lol* You admit that it&#039;s getting off topic, yet you get even further off topic all in the same sentence!!!<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks for clearing that spelling thing up for me. I wish I had time to help the two of you get back on topic, but I&#039;m going to have quite a bit to do for a while. I can only afford to make the short posts that I&#039;ve been making (like on a few other threads).<br />

I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s possible for you to make a coherent typo, SheepKing. Perhaps you were thinking of her when you typed my username and typed her&#039;s instead. </div>
