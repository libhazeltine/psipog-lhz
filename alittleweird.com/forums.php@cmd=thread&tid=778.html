My method of telepathy and all that good stuff basically ends up with me uncomfortably close, mentally, to my target, and I seem to have trouble disengaging myself from them afterward. It&#039;s like I open myself up and approach them from an angle where I can glean the most information, and then I kinda get &quot;sucked in.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of my friends especially asks me to read her a lot and for some reason I &quot;click&quot; with her very easily and find it hard to get my mental/aural integrity back to shape later.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any techniques or advice they&#039;d like to share about keeping your distance when getting so close to someone?<br />
<br />
<br />
Actual visualizations would be nice too, I&#039;m bad at severing the weak links that tend to form on their own.<br />
Edit: what I mean is- if you use visualizations to sever links or distance yourself or whatever, please share what you actually envision. I&#039;ve had limited success with the &quot;light shining out of the mist&quot; visual, where each person&#039;s psi sig is a beacon of light shining in a dark purple mist, for instance.</div>

It is a cold thing to do to someone who finds security in your unconditional understanding, but it is for your well being, and that is whats important.<br />

To make it easier, I remind myself that the best lessons are often painful..<br />

As for keeping your distance.. yeah, I have a tough time with this one as well..<br />

Its hard once you become intertwined with pretty much anyone.. and thats all I have to say about that!<br />

		<div id="post_14232" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I think being able to keep your distance is very much dependent on how strong your willpower/state of mind is to begin with. If you are emotionally unsettled at the time for whatever reason, or you are rusty on your shield upkeep, or your blood sugar is low, etc., it is going to be more difficult to pull away. <br />
<br />
Thoughts have momentum. If you are attempting any sort of energy task, such as establishing a link from a distance, and you don&#039;t feel any sort of resistance, you are probably just thinking about it, and not actually doing anything.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, it should at least take as much effort, if not more, to undo a link than it did to form in the first place. Unless they are shielding or something, in which case it&#039;s a struggle to get in, and you will be forcefully kicked out.<br />
<br />
But if you or your target are both emotionally receptive, that link is going to be harder and more complicated to break, especially because you two seem like friends. People naturally form links without even realizing it. Chopping the link, while sometimes effective, might actually cause harm to one or both of you. <br />
<br />
I think slow and steady is the message here, like pretty much everything psi. What you probably should do is really fine tune your shields, so that you get just the information that you need in the first place, without the emotional baggage. Then, work on slowly &quot;pinching&quot; the undesirable links. Or leaving the link in tact, but filtering/blocking the majority of information passing through it.<br />
<br />
Some people like to be isolated however, and may want to just shut everything out completely when they aren&#039;t using it. It&#039;s all a personal choice, and you really have to take the time to relax and get in a state where you can get information from your subconscious, and give it information to make the right shields etc.<br />
<br />
Good luck! </div>

To clarify, my view on links is that you form links with people as you become close to them. I have never personally had a link I have to wholly &quot;build&quot; myself, but the kind that form from strong friendships. These kinds of links I see only as a good thing, and if you take the time to search your aura or where ever the links may be, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find quite a few linking you to your dearest friends.<br />
