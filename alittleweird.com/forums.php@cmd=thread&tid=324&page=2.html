&quot;Wherever there is light, there is shadow; wherever there is length, there is shortness; wherever there is white, there is black. Just like these, as the self-nature of things can not exist alone, they are called non-substantial.&quot; <br />
~Buddha <br />
<br />
&quot;In this world the greatest courage is to drop the mind aside. The bravest man is who can see the world without the barrier of the mind, just as it is. It is tremendously different, utterly beautiful. There is nobody who is inferior and there is nobody who is superior -- there are no distinctions.&quot; - Osho <br />
<br />
And this is from an old conversation with my teacher and I. <br />
&quot;In my view there is no bad or good. That exists only in duality. The only truth is unity, so there is no room for opposites. Just infinite peace. No actions are good or bad. As Shakespeare once said it: &quot;Things are never good or bad by definition, it is the thoughts that make it so.&quot; I agree. It&#039;s just that some acts are done out of ignorance, and others are done out of even more ignorance. I don&#039;t feel like judging those too much, I never tend to lose myself in judgmental details.&quot;<br />
<br />
And one last fragment out of an old thread, also said by my old teacher:<br />
&quot;I believe that balance, and dualism, is something only from the dimension of our minds. It is not an actual fact. Dualism exists because our minds are conditioned in a dualistic way. Good or bad do not exist; we just label things as good or bad. Dualism belongs to the illusion, to the cover-up created by the mind. If you want to be able to see that life itself is always neutral, you got to train your mind by contemplation. It is liberating if you can live without the illusion of duality. Youâ€™ll experience the true dimension of unity when you do so. <br />
<br />
To do this, you got to keep things in your life as factual as possible. For example: Your girlfriend kisses you, that is good, right? Or so you think. But then, she performs the exact same act with another guy. Fact is, she does something called kissing. Though now suddenly it seems all bad to you. Why? She does exactly the same thingâ€¦ But your mind is conditioned in a way, which automatically links all kind of judgments to a happening situation. If we could see things as they are, instead of looking through the filters of the mind, we are free and you will never be unhappy again to say the least. <br />
<br />
Another example: If I cut through an apple with my knife, if I cut it in little pieces so I can eat it easier, thatâ€™s okay right?  Thatâ€™s good, no problem. But, if I use that exact same knife to cut something else like a throatâ€¦ then all of the sudden it is very badâ€¦why? To the knife it is exactly the same act, but the mental labels that cling to this act, are bad. So the world is not bad or good. Neither are the situations in it. It is our minds that are bad and good. <br />
<br />
Now Yin and Yang goes for the dimension of the mind, and the physical dimension in some aspects (like balance of the bodily energies etc.) But eventually, there is no such thing as balance, because there is only One. One truth, One Unity. How can you have two opposites, if there is just one. How can you have duality and polarity when there is only One? It cannot. So therefore balance is also an illusion. Though it is a very important illusion if you want to be able to see unity within this dimension. Balance is a bridge. Though not necessary.&quot; <br />
-Bentinho Massaro<br />
<br />
To put everything simply, and in short, duality is all based off of perspective. And that perspective creates a false reality, which then blocks the true reality--everything just is. A tree is a tree, a cat is a cat. </div>

<br />
What I was talking about earlier is very difficult to do, and you would have to be the master of your mind, in other words, enlightened. But as you said, things wouldn&#039;t be right, there would be no rules without duality. <br />
What I gathered from Spiritual Enlightenment books basically tells that the enlightened one would have full control of his mind, and with this, they could &quot;switch on&quot; a mindset to see duality controllably. The mind is obviously needed for us to survive, but for an enlightened one, they would control it completely and only use it to fit in smoothly with society. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, which is just a thought of mine, but if everyone was enlightened and did not follow duality, things would just fall into place. There would be no bad things happening because everyone would be one, instead of always using their different minds. I&#039;ve only felt complete bliss a few times in my life, but if everyone was in that state of bliss all the time, I can guarantee there would be no bad occurences, unless someone was not in bliss, and did follow duality compared to everyone else. <br />
<br />
So basically, yes, duality is needed to uphold a suitable living structure in this current society or in other words, the mind&#039;s realm. But if someone wants to live beyond what the repetitive mind has to offer, then duality is not necessary. </div>

We do bad things so we can learn NOT TO DO BAD THINGS in the future. Give it a rest with all those quotes. The CORRUPT live TO CORRUPT. Anyone that says you can love and do bad is wrong. Doing harm to yourself and another is bad. Common sense should dictate that. How would you feel if another did harm to your loved ones? They are called LOVED ONES for a reason.
