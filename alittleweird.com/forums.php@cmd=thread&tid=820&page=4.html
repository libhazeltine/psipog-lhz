What you did describe sounds like when I tried to heal myself a few times, tingling, pain and tingling, then it was good. Not sure. Are you in a better state of health afterwards?<br />

		<div id="post_14984" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Interesting topic... here are some of my random thoughts, not really well organized...<br />
<br />
I find a lot of people gravitate towards &#039;were-wolf&#039; more than anything, due to media influence and other factors, when infact they may have been something else in a past life and not wolf. But that can also be because they&#039;re not looking and just jumping to conclusions. And also, dreams are usually metaphorical, not literal, but can have some meaning towards past lives... They can also use this &#039;were-wolf&#039; thing as a disassociation from issues in their life, as a sort of escape route. This is obviously not always the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many ancient societies had some sort of &#039;were-creature&#039;; the creature differed by what was around. Obviously, where there were no wolves, there wouldn&#039;t be any &#039;were-wolfs&#039;, but other creatures such as &#039;were-tigers&#039;.  In some societies, shamans were said to be able to completely take on the mindset of the creatures to help the society and teach them lessons and tell stories (I&#039;m assuming <strong>m</strong>ental-shifting). And some stories even include hunters being able to <strong>p</strong>hysical shift into wolves to help them. But then again, these are just legends and tales, and cannot be taken as one-hundred percent fact... <br />
<br />
<br />
There are a few different types of shifting:<br />
<br />
M-shifting or mental shifting: When one&#039;s state of mind becomes more animal like.<br />
S-shifting or spiritual shifting: This one can be broken down into auric-, astral-, and dream-shifts, which are all fairly self-explanatory. <br />
P-shifting or physical shifting: There is a lot of controversy upon weather this is possible or not. It is when aspects of one&#039;s physical body take on attributes of another creature.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, one other note.. Watch out for bio-feedback, cause if you think you are shifting your mind might feel things that are actually not happening...<br />
<br />
<br />
One final thing... Kube, I do not remember where I heard this, but I heard that sometimes the first few times when a &#039;were-creature&#039; physical shifts, they black out... </div>

		<div id="post_14986" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yeah I heard that too. I read it from a few sources, one of which is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pilotwolf143/schedule.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.geocities.com/pilotwolf143/schedule.htm">here</a> They&#039;ve got a few articles on shifting.<br />
<br />
About most people gravitating towards were-wolf. I find it strange too, but there&#039;s also a simple explanation. Wolves live in groups, like humans. They all have their own territory, yet they identify themselves to a pack, much the same way we all live separately, yet identify ourselves to our society. Some people think therians and weres are animal spirits that latched on to a human soul upon conception. Wolves would do this more often since we have a lifestyle and social system similar to theirs. This is just a theory, though, and might be wrong...<br />
<br />
You&#039;re right about the dreams too. Dreams are often metaphors and shouldn&#039;t be taken literally, I learned that when I managed to approximately predict events with my dreams. The thing is, dreams are also rarely recurring and they don&#039;t usually bring that feeling afterward. In my case anyways. I would usually have dismissed it as a dream and nothing more, but it had the same feel and occurrence as the premonitions I&#039;ve had before. It&#039;s tough to explain, it&#039;s like when you wake up it doesn&#039;t feel like you&#039;re actually waking up from a dream.<br />
<br />
As for bio-feedback, I&#039;m also trying to watch out for that... I think that might be part of the mental block we were talking about a few posts earlier. Thinking &quot;maybe the first time was just an illusion, so maybe nothing will happen this time.&quot; I think the mental block&#039;s more about self-doubt, the same problem I had when starting psionics, than fear.<br />
<br />
PS: I forgot to mention, When I blacked out last night, I &quot;woke up&quot; sitting on the edge of my bed.I was trying to shift while lying down on my back.</div>

I have vivid dreams all the time, as it seems some are true and some are just dreams to me. What&#039;s ya weirdest dreams?</div>One of them was of a plane crashing and this guy I knew losing his right arm in the accident. Two months later, I went to Greece and that same guy fell during a race and broke his right arm. Before we went on the trip I already knew that there would be an accident (plane crash, in the dream) and that something would happen to the guy&#039;s arm. I tend to exaggerate things, so I try to always look at big details like the plane crash as metaphors for something less important... I always know when the dream means something because they&#039;re so vivid. I usually don&#039;t remember my dreams, but these ones stay in my head like a regular memory would.</div>

wow thats creepy hmm well ill fid somethng about it but about werewolves i saw something on the tv also about how ppl would start going crazy when ppl had to make there own bread they didnt go to stores so this wierd fungus grew on the weat and when ppl ate it it made them go crazy and think they turned into werewolves it was scientifically provn they really didnt turn but i saw one of the videos on the ppl they tested its amazing that one fungui can duplicate into that</div>Just wanted to throw in there that the fungus you&#039;re naming is called ergot. Ergot is known to grow on wet grain, specifically rye, and cause hallucinations in many mammals.<br />

As for the werewolves and vampires, <a href="http://www.otherkin.com/phpBB3" target="_blank" title="http://www.otherkin.com/phpBB3">Otherkin.com</a> is a good, rational community for that type of information. Several people there are (or at least claim to be since it&#039;s difficult to prove over the internet) psychic vampires, sanguarian vampires, therianthropes, and many others things (demons, angels, and fae to name a few), although the moderators tend to be critical on anyone who starts making outrageous claims. <br />
