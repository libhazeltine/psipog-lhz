		<div id="post_12604" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">In terms of PK, apparently moving an empty beer can was my biggest. I am still not entirely sure wether it was me or simply some normal physical force. The beer can was placed on a nightstand and after about 20 minutes of concentration I managed to roll it about 2 cm to the direction I wanted, very suddenly. Immediately after that I replaced the can and after a delay of 5 seconds it moved by itself about the same distance - which is what made me unsure. Personally I still think I moved it given the huge delay and absence of other forces.<br />
<br />
I´ve had a period of straight precognitive dreams for over a year, something that doesn´t appear to occur to me anymore in this straight forward way. I used to be able to tell other people about what would happen even in their presence, even though rarely.<br />
<br />
I do get a strong sense of environments upon entering them, whenever they play a part in my personal future over a long period.<br />
<br />
Thats about it :)<br />

Edit: Actually I used to be extremely good at guessing certain people´s ages. It occured rarely but if it did, I had no doubt and got it out - stunned quite a few people.</div>

I stopped right after this for a while because it was not &quot;acceptable&quot; by society to know that much about someone. I had taken soon after a 2 month break. I did noticed that if you have a curiosity about someone it helps in trying to &quot;feel&quot; them &quot;out.&quot; I usually have an extreme out-pour of curiosity towards the person&#039;s actions and emotions then as soon as I commence on accepting this curiosity a storm  of emotions and thoughts rises the tides of my mind to an inebriating point, which then I just talk and kinda watch myself talk.  <br />
<br />
<br />
To say the least, I DO NOT SUGGEST DOING THIS!!! The person was freaked and did not talk to me for a year. After that occurrence, though, I noticed that they always kept an eye on me whenever we passed each other.<br />

Your current emotion really effects everything you do, all the way down to Psionics. It is how I begin most of my experiments I note my feelings and then I change it in order to get the results that I want.</div>

		<div id="post_14149" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Maybe it&#039;s stupid, but whenever I play videogames that involve some kind of binary random element, I can predict the outcome about 85-90% of the time... Example is Resident Evil 4. The &quot;action buttons&quot; are randomly either R + L or A + B [on gamecube], and you only find out a split second before you have to press them. I usually was able to predict which combination it was a few instants before that and sometimes pressed the buttons too early =P I wouldn&#039;t bring it up but it happened with me 85%-90% of the time for literally months at a time.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s a pattern to it that I don&#039;t know of, let me know, I&#039;d hate to think I was better at anything than I am =P<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also been pretty good at &quot;viewing&quot; people that I don&#039;t know when on the phone with someone who does know them, and describing what I see, again usually with about 80% accuracy. Sometimes I asked for names, sometimes I just went on gut feeling.<br />
<br />
I dunno whether you&#039;d prefer to classify that as ESP, Clairvoyance, Empathy, or whatever.<br />
<br />
My policy was that I wouldn&#039;t &quot;view&quot; anyone that I had met before or had been given any significant information about... so no ex-partners, best friends, or anyone that the person helping me would have talked about in any kind of detail.<br />
<br />
I recommend it, its fun to practice ^_^</div>
