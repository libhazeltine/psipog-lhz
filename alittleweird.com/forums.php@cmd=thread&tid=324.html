		<div id="post_7642" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Mainly, the psychic works in the area of increased awareness. <br />
<br />
Consider when your born your in the &quot;light&quot; - you slowly step out of that light as you grow up. You step out that light by how you let things affect you or in other words how you let things change your thinking.<br />
<br />
 A negative person (or thinker) cant read a positive person. Its like looking in a dark room with a broken flashlight.<br />
<br />
A positive person can read positive people and negative people. Its that simple.<br />
<br />
Its because the psychic operates at a higher vibration. Someone of low vibrations cant clearly sense someone resonating at a higher rate. They can either be drawn to you with comfort or lack a response to your presence. In all cases a person resonating at higher rates can be sensed by all just at different levels depending on there own vibration. The higher you go in thought is the higher you go in vibration until you let it become you and its not something you &#039;try&#039; to do. You get to a point eventually where &#039;you just are&#039;.<br />
<br />
You might be saying well, im positive so wheres all the trippy stuff? The psychic sees information as the purple elephant in the room. Being aware of your surroundings is actually letting your conscious interact with those objects or people. All you have to do to be aware of it is to wrap your mind around something. Get that mental picture in your head. If you look around and make out details of something in your room with your eyes closed then you just consciously became aware of that something.<br />
<br />
Concerning the mind and the talents of the mind. It is all a matter of perception. Some of it might be more obvious if you look closer.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
If your a positive thinking individual, then you know who the dominantly negative thinker is, don&#039;t you? You feel in your heart that &quot;this person is trouble&quot;.<br />
<br />
- You can tell some people that have been in jail or just that have been in trouble and then you get surprised cause you meet some people that have been in jail and you would never know (real life, tv, whatever). You tell yourself, &quot;well, I could tell by the way he carries himself or herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
 -The reason that person is carrying himself in a certain way would be because the person is focusing on a specific thought pattern - Or you could say that person is carrying himself like that cause he lacks &#039;light&#039; or has light. Theres no such thing as an evil person, only people that &#039;lack&#039;.<br />
<br />
 -Listen to your parents when they tell you things about your friends! I didn&#039;t, and I wouldn&#039;t have it no other way cause I love learning first hand from my own mistakes...but I would have loved more to not have made any to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Telepathy-<br />
<br />
You may hear things in your head or &#039;feel&#039; it. Regardless, telepathy is the ability to receive thoughts. Thought/energy. Whatever you wish to consider it. Thats one thing you might find out as you read. Many people call different things different names that essentially mean and more importantly ARE the same thing. Break it down. Were all connected. Were all connected because everything is energy. Thoughts - Not so dense / Body - pretty dense. Everything in some form or another (broken down) is energy. We are energy. <br />
<br />
We hold the ability to interact with concept which means you hold the ability to perceive this energy on different levels of consciousness. <br />
<br />
Theres only two kinds of thoughts - Good and Bad or Negative and Positive.<br />
<br />
 When you know if a person is bad or has bad intentions towards you or has done bad things in the past, thats a form of telepathy. Just like the saying, were all psychic to a degree. The degrees are measured in your thoughts.   The psychic is able to read into those vibes. The psychic does that by paying attention. Not to vibe. But to how that vibe makes them (you) feel and begins to interpret.<br />
<br />
This is where psychic receptivity starts. The different ways we choose to read those vibes is where we get different psychics. The different ways the individual chooses to perceive or more comfortable in one form of perception will depend if your a natural sensitive, precog, clairvoyant, empath, medium. Its all essentially the same energy just being perceived in different ways. No one can tell you &#039;your this kind of psychic&#039;. Its all about where you feel comfortable.<br />
<br />
Being that this psychic energy branches off you can go into different areas of the psychic you just have to get comfortable with different levels of perception. Using your ears to listen is one of many ways to &#039;pay attention&#039;. <br />
<br />
Positive thinking is like turning on the faucet, its that easy to do. Little meditation and clearing your mind and *boom* you got positive thinking or at least you subside the negative. <br />
<br />

&quot;While physical vision depends on the eyes, astral vision depends on the various kinds of astral matter being in a condition of receptiveness to different undulations. The various kinds of matter within the astral body are aware of their own kind; thus, fine matter is aware of fine matter, and gross matter is aware of gross matter, and so on. As the result of rearrangement only the grossest matter of the astral body is visible since it is the kind of matter that compose the thick outer sheath. Under such circumstances, the new denizen of the astral sphere sees only the worst of it, and also only the worst of his fellow denizens, even though they are not in so low of a state as himself.&quot;<br />

Positive is light and light is love and love opens your body to receive that universal life force on a daily basis. High vibrations emit via high thoughts. Aura is a representation of the electromagnetic field and thoughts travel via aura and represented in color aka vibes. <br />

My understanding from experienced is that positive thinking promotes high vibrations. Again, common sense should tell you that positive thinking is anything that is not negative thinking. To look at a negative vibe and use the &#039;positive&#039; to counteract or understand the vibe - to not let it get to your core and affect your mood and infect your thought pattern.<br />
<br />
If you can do that you dont open yourself up to your higher self but you allow your higher self to communicate with me via perception and intuition. You KNOW whats best for yourself. Through your higher self (astral self) all things are connected and can be perceived.<br />
<br />
If your a negative thinking diving into the astral you will only get so fare in perception. Negative limits yourself aka your higher self.<br />

<br />
You use meditation to subside the busy thoughts of negativity. Because seriously, how bothersome are thoughts that are positive in nature?<br />
<br />
When you subside negativity you allow this energy (ki,psi,prana) regardless of what you call it and where it comes from THAT energy all comes from one place - the universe. Directly or Indirectly. <br />
<br />
The trick in this world is what are you going to do when confronted with negativity? Meet the bad vibe with another bad vibe? <br />
<br />
God is an indescribable force, like love. Positive thinking are forms of &#039;love&#039;. Im not talking about being a hippy im talking about being a decent human being. Love thy neighbor but not talk to him type of stuff. You don&#039;t have to like everyone, but you should understand why they are a prick or be so confident in yourself that you don&#039;t care what they think. They are thinking negative because they let something or someone affect them. <br />
<br />
You think positive enough over a decent period of time you over flow with positive until its coming out of your ears and then you attract positive people, situations, entities, new levels of awareness. Taking the red pill.<br />
<br />
old sayings like &quot;were all connected&quot; and &quot;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&quot; will make sense.<br />
<br />
Your intuition or subconscious knows. It can only talk to you through things that you  understands. By not letting your thoughts bother you, you allow this link to form develop. You begin a new relationship with a long lost friend.<br />
<br />
Negativity brings disharmony to yourself and everyone around you. More importantly to yourself. <br />
<br />
You guys are smart. I&#039;m waiting for someone to tell me that having a positive outlook on life is illogical to the progression of the self. <br />

All of our negative traits or bad habits are learned. Human Teachings. Low Human Teachings. Because misery absolutely loves company.

You can also say &#039;love&#039; is your subconscious. The undeniable force that tells you what is right. It all runs together in some point cause IT is all connected and WE are all connected, cause we are concept feeling emotions. Those emotions resonate in your body in different levels. Good emotions resonate much higher then Bad emotions. Common sense should dictate which is which.<br />
<br />
Its never bad to - experience this world - but you have the choice as to which thoughts your going to let affect your actions. Its always been about choice. Your actions resonate as do your thoughts. Same principal. Ask yourself what is &#039;love&#039;. Then ask yourself what is &#039;god&#039;. Theres only Good and Bad people in this world the rest is still deciding. The Bad people are bad because they lack Good or Light or Positive energy. As a result of that lack you disconnect yourself from the higher plans of existence and you descend into the lowers plans. You create your own world. Choose which thought/vibes to resonate in your body and know your thoughts affect your actions. <br />

Here is another reason why I dislike duality: It gets you nowhere. Judging on whether someone is good or bad, or if something is light or dark is a waste of time.

Hitting the gas pedal in a car makes the car move, but isn&#039;t the complete picture, that action in itself doesn&#039;t make the car move all on its own. I believe the same is true for your theory on positive and negative mindsets etc. Perhaps it is true that if one is positive in life then he will have an easier time with psionics and life and the vice versa. But, maybe that mindset is just a pedal for other mechanisms that you do not see. If it is just a pedal for the end result (psychic abilities, success) then there is another way to do it as well. A way to transcend the need to push the pedal, just like a mechanic can engineer a car to run in some other imaginative way. If all that I said is true, then one could be negative or positive and the results would be the same. Thus ridding the use of duality.</div>

Your brain only does what you consciouses and subconscious minds tell it to do. Nothing more and nothing less. You dominantly think on either side of the hemispheres of the brain.

Learning the positive in all aspect of the negative is key. To see light in darkness. To see someone who is yelling at you and say &quot;hmm, I can either yell back or ask them why they are yelling&quot; - the choice. How will you choose to confront that negativity.

Like I Said There is no darkness only a result of a lack of light. Misery loves Company.

You need to learn the negative aspects of life in order to know how to counteract them in future events. Providing you Learn.

Antisankari,

&quot;What if there simply is nothing dark and nothing light? Everything would just exist.&quot;

That would be nice, if it was true. EVERYTHING is derived from something else. Even your reply is motivated by some aspect of the negative and positive spectrum. Images you see on TV and the Music you listen to are derived from either negative or postive thoughts. 

&quot;Our brains ultimately say what we will experience. We seem to have a fair amount of control, but some hard-wired stuff just cant be undone.&quot;

Your brain only does what you consciouses and subconscious minds tell it to do. Nothing more and nothing less. You dominantly think on either side of the hemispheres of the brain. Through releasing the ego you work on both sides of the brain thus reducing the amount of activity or strain that any one side of the brain might incur. By doing that you increase your awareness.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_7734" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I like where you are going with this, the picture is just a bit unclear. The simplest system in which there are distinct units of information is binary. That would lend itself to energy at the smallest possible organizational level being composed of two diametrically opposed &#039;bits&#039;: On, off; light, dark; +/-; 0,1; positive, negative. I will continue to use &#039;light&#039; and &#039;dark&#039; to describe this energy because that&#039;s what I&#039;ve experienced and I&#039;m most familiar with.<br />
<br />
Light and dark have nothing to do with any human connotations of positive and negative, it&#039;s like yin and yang except simpler than that, the only property each has is that it is opposite the other. <br />
<br />
This energy can exist in pure form in the universe, however, on the macroscopic level, things require more complexity. Thats why there are more complex forms of energy. To use the classical 4 elements, Fire is LightLight, Water is DarkDark, Earth is DL, Air is LD. I don&#039;t know how accurate that is, but you get the gist of organizational systems. Otherwise, it&#039;d be like trying to program a simulator in machine code.<br />
<br />
Thus, most everything that we deal with is &#039;grey&#039;.<br />

As for the tie-in with telepathy, it has nothing to do with whether the person is &#039;positive&#039; or &#039;negative&#039;. Rather, it has to do with the fact that each mind runs its own language. When I get a telepathic feed on someone, I immediately get a burst of feeling and raw thoughtforms, then my subconscious has to go to work translating it into information my mind can digest. People with energy types (similar language) close to mine, people I am familiar with, and people I&#039;m close to are easier to read than a complete stranger. </div>
