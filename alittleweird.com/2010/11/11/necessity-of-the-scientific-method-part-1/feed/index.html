		<description>finally i will say that finding "truth" in my opinion is not impossible but to so, would require a radical and diverse change in the way we think, and approach our world and regard intelligence. :) Oh and teach, perhaps a more focused on bending the education to the person, not the person to the education. But alas that is not entirely related (but if your interested http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9LelXa3U_I&#38;feature=channel - that elaborates on the concept)</description>

		<description>I agree with above, and also reality is subject to perspective and therefore truth is. Who is to govern what is "truth"? That one reality is better than another. Or rather one perspective of the world is better than another. How can one truth be argued as better than another logically? We could say majority but as history shows,the majority can/ and usually is incorrect. Thus why can't all perspectives be truth ?..Yes i know this would cause anarchy

If we state that :Truth is essentially an idea/theory/ thought/ or perspective which is correct. If we assume that everything we know to be "truth" is indeed unquestionable, than (all though a cliché, we would still think the world is flat, or believe something else which could also be considered somewhat insane. Depending on who is in power..one theory was that we were all balancing on-top of a turtle lol)  

In life i think we strive for data, in which to form truths or theorys to manage the world we live in. To essentially put things into box's, they maybe circles and better fitted in another section however it seems that is our aim. 

I enjoyed this post, an interesting topic :)</description>

		<description>Discovering some non-physical truths are impossible, like the old philosophical questions, we won't find out what happens after we die, the meaning of life or if there is a higher power at work since truth isn't subjective so the answer to these questions aren't within our reach. 

While I'm at it, physical thruths aren't necessarily true either, i.e. I could argue that I'm not being pulled by gravity to the ground but that the world is falling upwards. Ridiculous example but you get the point. 

I agree that discovering truths are essential to our survival but is it really that important for us to live forever and something we really want? I'm not just talking about the human race I also mean the idea of an afterlife. 

Wouldn't life loose all meaning if we did live forever? 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that trying to figure out some "ultimate truth" is an endless spiral without any solution. 
It's not pointless, I think we can learn alot about ourslef by practising meditation and OOBEs.

In the end what happens happens, only thing we can do is live in the now and make the most out of what we got.

Looking forward to your next post. :)</description>
