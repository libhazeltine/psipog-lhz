		<description>Is it possible that it was not a dead person, but simply another OOB person and you couldn't see him for a different reason?</description>

		<description>Super cool! That's absolutely wild. I never truly succeeded in the whole OBE thing. It's weird, because my body always feels 'loosely attached' when I lie down, but I've never been able to get all the way out.</description>

		<description>This is the real stuff, immediate experience. If you want to find truth, I suggest trying to understand these kind of experiences. To be able to really understand what happened here, to get a true mental grasp of it, I'd say you need a deep understanding of reality already. In my experience the converse holds also, i.e. if you can wrap your head around this experience, if you manage to really understand what it is to be out of your body, if you try to understand thought by itsself and why thinking works as you described in this experience etc, then you should develop true understanding of reality, thereby broadening the scope of what your consciousness can experience. As I see it, that is one way to find truth. Truth should be an experience, not a theory.</description>

		<description>Interesting!!!  You could have asked some questions to him as you thought.  This might have given more information like any contact can be made like that.  If so, what is the perception on other side.</description>

		<description>Wow, that's amazing. You should write up something before you try this again (intentionally or not), like a script. So that you won't get overwhelmed by the excitement again. Keep us posted on your findings if you do! :-)</description>
