		<div id="post_10810" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So, have you heard of 11:11?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve read on the internet that its the sign of &#039;light workers&#039;, or it&#039;s the sign of spirits trying to get in contact with you, or it&#039;s the sign of who knows what... Aliens even? I do not know the significance of it.<br />
<br />
However, I have been seeing it, almost everyday for the past four weeks. At work I just happen to look down at the clock at 11:11. I get home at night am working on my computer and then bam 11:11 . Today I was driving home from a friends house and I looked at my clock. 11:05... I then look up at a digital display that is out front of restraunt/club, and it reads 11:11. <br />
<br />
Do you think that it&#039;s appearance, or my looking at the clock at these times has to do with my subconscious recognizing that I am attributing it to be significant, and then when I see it in the peripheral vision, I am cued to look? Do you think the numbers have any significance at all?<br />
<br />
Strange dreams now. As you all know (probably) I have some pretty freaky dreams sometimes. Like just straight up abstract weird dreams, that I don&#039;t particularly attribute to being significant. But there are two dreams that I&#039;ve had in the last three weeks that have particularly left me remembering them and thinking they are caused by something other than myself.<br />
<br />
Both of them involve some type of &quot;Ghost&quot;, or spirit, appearing to me in some form. For the purpose of brevity I will only make a synopsis of the dreams.<br />
<br />
Dream #1: Sitting in the living room of my old house, there is a woman infront of me who identifies herself as a medium (someone who talks to spirits). She tells me a spirit of someone I used to know wants to talk to me. The spirit whispers to me, you&#039;re going to see a ghost now. Don&#039;t be afraid. Everything will be okay. As this is happening I start to feel strange vibrations, and get very cold. My lungs and chest feel paralysed and I wake up cold, very cold. End.<br />
<br />
Dream #2: I am at my office and I am taking pictures of myself. And the lights go out. The last picture I take on my camera has a spirit standing behind me and I start feeling cold/having trouble breathing and I wake up. end.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div>

What happens is that the ghost could&#039;nt contact you for reasons I don&#039;t know , so the ghost asked your spirit guide for assistance in contacting you. <br />
This is why she tries to calm you and the reason for this scenario taking place in the living room is because in this place you feel safe to be able to react and act more relaxed and calm.<br />

If i&#039;m wrong and the second dream occured after the first dream then it might say that the ghost still watching you and you shouldn&#039;t forget her. <br />

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_<br />
<br />
If the ghost isn&#039;t hostile than try to contact with her, maybe through your spirit guide in your dream ( You might wanna learn a little about spirit guides first ) .<br />
<br />
If else, then get a second opinion from someone more proffesional than me :P <br />

		<div id="post_10831" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">The problem with Dream Analysis is that its pretty much all on the dreamer to figure out, a psychologist can ask questions to get the person thinking deeper or recalling more but to lead the person or suggest possible interpretations is not usually helpful unless you have a history with the person and know them quite throughly.<br />
<br />
Your theory can seem sound and helpful, but it might not be the message the person is &#039;supposed&#039; to get.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_10831">The problem with Dream Analysis is that its pretty much all on the dreamer to figure out, a psychologist can ask questions to get the person thinking deeper or recalling more but to lead the person or suggest possible interpretations is not usually helpful unless you have a history with the person and know them quite throughly.

		<div id="post_10835" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Thank you for your responses. Your analysis of dream 1 seemed to be the same as what I thought it could potentially mean, But perhaps there are more meanings to it than we are seeing? Maybe it&#039;s a sign that I should talk to an old friend that I was close to but have drawn away from? Maybe I&#039;m afraid to do that? Spirit Guides, and ghosts... Do scare me a bit :-P.<br />
<br />
As for being cold. I do sleep with the window open and the ceiling fan on. However, summer in south dakota is quite warm. There is no reason I should wake up shivering. At least not to my knowledge. <br />
<br />
The second dream occured after the first by a couple weeks. However, in the second dream there was a female standing near me when I took the picture, and after I started being afraid/freaking out, I sought her for calming me down. Sorry about leaving out that detail.<br />
<br />
As for my analysis of the dreams togethor. I can&#039;t really think of anything that would provoke them outright. Or any reason why I would dream them at the moment.</div>
