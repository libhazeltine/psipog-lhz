		<div id="post_11873" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Ok, so I&#039;ve been feeling auras for about a year and a half now. That&#039;s a good and all, but now I&#039;m at the point where I want to figure out why I can, and possibly what it is that I am feeling, and other things about it.<br />
<br />
Because I have never met anyone who can feel it like I can (I only know one other person who can and she has to concentrate and it&#039;s still really weak), I assume there are people on here who can do it too. By &quot;aura&quot; I don&#039;t just mean like the emotion you get in a certian vicinity of a person, but more the physical feeling.<br />
<br />
<strong>-So here&#039;s what I&#039;m asking-</strong><br />
<br />
-When did you start feeling auras?<br />
<br />
-Did you try to feel auras or did it come naturally?<br />
<br />
-Do any of your family members have/had any weirdness with electricity? (Ex: watches, CAT scans, electronic malfunctions, etc.)<br />
<br />
-What do you feel physically from different emotions and people?<br />
<br />
-Did it ever hurt you?<br />
<br />
-Do you not feel some people&#039;s as well? (Be specific- age groups, genders, friends, enemies, etc)<br />
<br />
Right. So, if you could just answer some of that stuff, hopefully I&#039;ll figure some stuff out =] Thanks</div>

It felt really gross and disturbing and dark. Once i drove closer i realized it was the kid from our school that made a bomb threat to the school and raped two young kids. ya so that was the one time i relly felt an aura, to that extent that is.

I think the longer a person has that dirty-type of mindset, the more corrupt/incompatible it is, or the stronger they&#039;re feeling it, the stronger it feels to the people around them. That&#039;s just my theory though.</div>

i think Riven ment it as do you not feel ur friends auras because of personal boundries type of thing. Well with me whenever i touch someone i feel their pain and stuff. on sunday at church i was praying for a guy and i couldnt keep my hand on him because my left arm started to really hurt and stuff, but i guess that is more like empathy. but i really cant control &quot;feeling&quot; yet but i think i am so used to my friends &quot;feel&quot; that i dont notice it unless they are upset.</div>

Yeah that was pretty unclear, sorry. I meant like you walk into a room with a person and can feel theirs, right? So normally you can feel everyone&#039;s. But when you&#039;re with a person you&#039;re friends/compatable with and they aren&#039;t highly emotional at the moment, can you still feel their&#039;s w/o trying?<br />
<br />
I&#039;d agree with that theory =] At least the majority don&#039;t feel too gross, but when one does stick, I go and stick my hand in someone else&#039;s aura. Maybe that&#039;s not a good idea...how do you get it off?<br />
<br />
Faceless:<br />
That would suck...I think that&#039;s empathy though. The only thing similar to that that has happened to me is when I was in spanish class and my hand started cramping up and it hurt super bad, and the guy next to me yelped and said his hand hurt. That might have been him though.</div>

<br />
Yes and no. The feeling is definitely dimmer, but I can still feel it. I&#039;m especially sensitive to this because I spent a large amount of my time, in Psionics and Chi, focusing on the energy aspects of the systems (very long years).<br />
I don&#039;t necessarily have to see the people or be very close to them to feel them.<br />
<br />
Earlier though before it got as intruding as it is now, Friends, or people I was more &quot;compatible&quot; with felt more translucent or warm, as if I weren&#039;t really feeling them.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that this is a natural sense that people use all the time which measures the compatibility of the energy of those people around you, with you, and that it can be greatly strengthened.<br />
<br />
AS FOR how to clean it off?<br />
I send a pocket of energy to the center of the area (or use whats already there) and then explode it outwards to force away any sticky energy; It takes a lot of focus.<br />
If its especially sticky, It helps to force energy into a hand of the opposing area and then wipe, or carve it off physically while pumping more energy into that area and pushing the dirty energy away while relaxing the bonds(basically combining those two techniques).<br />
<br />
And a common tip for when you&#039;re focusing energy or pushing it away: Exhale.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps :)</div>
