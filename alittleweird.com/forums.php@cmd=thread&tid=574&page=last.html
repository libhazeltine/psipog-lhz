Back then I thought it was ghosts, now that I think about it, it may have been left over empathy? Because if you think about it, your obviously going to be very worried/nervous when you are in an EMS truck and either you are in a severe condition or a loved one. I find it interesting how emotions can be left behind. Or maybe I was picking them up from a different time/space?<br />

If you dont know body world is people that have died that gave their body to be made into an &quot;art form&quot; they are skined and preserved and really creepy. i couldnt stand it for more than and hour. then i ran off in the museum and went to the bugs.

Well, we aren&#039;t comfortable with dead people because we don&#039;t really want to see ourselves dead. I guess the uncomfortable feelings are caused by the dead people&#039;s regrets, sadness, depression, fears...These feelings are so powerful that you can feel it because you just can. However if those sad feeling are strong enough they could turn into ghosts, and hunt the truck for a long long long time, those feelings would stay anyways because the ghosts exist for those feelings. You could try to cleanse the aura with your thoughts, create a shield to block those off... And if there are ghosts, don&#039;t mess with them...especially if you don&#039;t know what it is...if you hear if and it hunts you get a master monk to help you out(careful not to get a fake monk to help you). That should pretty much work if you listen to the instructions given to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, if you can the feelings of dead people at a place, see if you can sense the depression of the dead animals. Then to the dead animals that we eat, meat. If you actually sense that then I assume that meat will gross you out and you will become a vegetarian.<br />
Just a thought =p</div>

Actually, I think the ambulance thing would be more closely related to Psychometry than Empathy, but then you could probably argue that Psychometry and Empathy/Telepathy are related.</div>Maybe Psychometry is an extention of Telepathy/Empathy, where you just leave that information on an object. If this were so Telepathy/Empathy would be like talking on the phone to someone, while Psychometry is like someone calling and leaving a message on the answering machine that way you can reply latter.<br />
<br />
Just an interesting concept I thought up of that I wanted to share with all of you.</div>

Incidentally, I recall reading a theory that most encounters with ghosts/spirits are simply unintentional Psychometry, and the text recommended throwing a good party in the affected area, thus imprinting the good thoughts/emotions over the bad ones. Now, naturally you can&#039;t throw a party in an ambulance (unless you&#039;re REALLY determined), but if it occurs in a more accessible area, I&#039;d say give it a shot. At least it&#039;s an excuse to have a party... :D</div>
