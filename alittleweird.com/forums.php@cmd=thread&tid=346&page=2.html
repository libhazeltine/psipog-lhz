I think I understand the theory Erik has, and I can understand a few reasons why Vimick could say time is an illusion, but for all practical purpose of this thread I&#039;m going to go with Eriks explination of time.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s look at energy? How does it effect time?<br />
<br />
My answer would be that it directs which event is happening each frame of time. Meaning that energy is the choice, it dictates what path the &quot;observer&quot; will take. because some energies are controllable, this means that we can manipulate certain paths time takes us on, however; there are some paths which are unavoidable because we can not or have not controlled at the point in time that we are.<br />
<br />
This limits the amount of optional paths we can take, as well as influence which option we take. This could explain reasons why forms of precognition may be possible. we are just looking down the easiest range of paths time could take, the ones with the most &quot;pull&quot; towards them. <br />
<br />
ofcourse, this means that the future is not necessarily set in stone, however; it&#039;s deffinately not open to every path/event.<br />

<br />
If the cycle is to continue as such, wouldn&#039;t that mean that the higher you go in the dimentional chain, the more this fades ito mental concepts?<br />
<br />
if there would be an eleventh dimention, it would discribe all concepts of thought. Atleast that&#039;s how I&#039;m understanding, and the 12th dimention could then discribe our concept of &quot;changing oppinions&quot; in a sense. It would cause us to dissapear from one plane of thought to another, to where our concept of time is changed.<br />
<br />
This ofcourse contradicts with the introduction, but having an eleventh dimention being &quot;time&quot; just doesn&#039;t quite make sense with the biggining.<br />
<br />
I think, Based of of this information, that once you trancend the first ten dimentions, you go into the &quot;realm&quot; of thought.<br />
<br />
this could, in itself, be used to explain the ability of Telekenisis. We&#039;re just traveling along different dimentions, and, through this, we manifest movement which we can see in the third dimention.<br />
<br />
atleast, This is my concept that I can get from this. Your thoughts?</div>

According to this theory, the 10th Dimension is everything of all time, at all time, in each universe of every universe anywhere, everywhere.<br />
<br />
Everything.<br />
<br />
Think about your mind being one dimension above the dimension you are observing.  We observe the static 3 dimensions from the time dimension, thus observing the passage of time.  Being &quot;enlightened&quot; to observe the higher dimensions would enable you to view the lower dimensions. In the 10th dimension, our mind would basically BE that dimension.  At that point there is nothing to really &quot;see.&quot;  You see everything all at once everywhere.  You would BE everything.  There is really no more &quot;you.&quot;  This would classically be referred to &quot;God&#039;s Realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to this theory, there isn&#039;t anything past the 10th dimension.  To look at it another way, all lower dimensions are distillates OF the 10th dimension.<br />

I think that you should probably just draw to your own conclusions after truly studying about the concepts shown. What you are talking about here is Parallel universes. Which, according to the info presented, would fall under the 3rd demention of two seperate universes. (falling in the regions of the seventh eighth and ninth dementions)<br />

According to this, anything andeverything we could imagine being possible is possible. All you have to do is travel along the correct path in the correct dimentions. <br />

<br />
Space-time is such an amazing topic, I love it so much.<br />
Relating it to psi is also very interesting!<br />
<br />
Time is affected by mass (space), time moves slower around things with higher mass because heavier things skew space-time (space and time are linked btw, otherwise we wouldn&#039;t age).  An example is that people that live in higher altitudes (slightly further form the Earth&#039;s massive center) age slightly faster.  Time also moves slower during high acceleration (for the thing being accelerated) because moving through space-time at higher speeds also skews space-time, just like high mass does.<br />
<br />
So, if we can conclude that we can draw psi from anything physical, with mass, what would that mean for how psi affects time?<br />
<br />
Could psi be the glue that holds space and time together?<br />
If we can draw psi from space, does that mean we can draw it from time as well?<br />
if not psi, perhaps something else? I&#039;ll call it &quot;isp&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If we could use psi to simulate high mass or high acceleration, could we slow time?<br />
<br />
Very interesting!!!!</div>
