Whats interesting is that Kundalini Syndrome appears to be an attempt at categorizing the sensations of a spiritual experience and its side effects. I would by no means disagree with much of the listed symptoms and side effects as possible, but it doesn&#039;t go into positive effects.</div>

		<div id="post_9152" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I think that one&#039;s perspective has to do with how one approaches the Kundalini. Some people almost treat it like a religion and seem to box it in. This is where the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; ways to awaken it stem from. I have a friend who is Hindu and knows quite a bit about the Kundalini. She holds the similar belief that I do in that the Kundalini is not a thing, and that there is no right or wrong way. However, it is simply a metaphor or tool to help one understand and ultimately reach enlightenment. In my studies I have heard and read of the proper way to awaken the Kundalini through systematic steps, meditation, exercises etc. I think this is where perspectives divide. I don&#039;t think that is necessary. By saying there is a &quot;proper&quot; way you are restricting a great power. Many Qi Gong masters have become enlightened to this extent, but do not strictly believe in the Kundalini per say. Take it to be a cultural difference for describing a similar abstract concept if you will. I don&#039;t believe that the Kundalini is dangerous and defiantly not something you can die from, however, I do believe that it is (like any power) something that should be treated with honor and upmost respect. If you want to learn about the Kundalini there are many books on the subject, but remember you own beliefs and interpret it accordingly.</div>

<br />
The theory is that there is no awakening improperly, difficult experiences are just attempting to teach you something to help you move to the next step, even though it may seem beyond your capability to handle. The psychedelic areas a baby sitter is advised in the off chance you do have a difficult trip, they don&#039;t guide you but can serve as reassurance if you need it, a spiritual guide would work similarly. As far as the yoga goes, depending how complicated it gets a teacher is advisable so you don&#039;t hurt yourself physically.</div>
