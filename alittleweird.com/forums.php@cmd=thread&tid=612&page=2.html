<br />
  First, I guess I should say that Psychic combat is a real phenomenon, although it is rather rare that one would engage in it. The main reason why I may encounter it more often than yourselves is that I know most of the &quot;naturals&quot; (People who&#039;ve manifested the ability without practice) in my school personally. Now, There are also a few of these people who do practice (including myself) and we often mess around with each other out of boredom.<br />
<br />
  Granted, these battles are just minor annoyances compared to the real thing, so I can&#039;t offer you a huge amount of help in the field on a first hand account, but I am a decent strategist, so I can help you out in that area.<br />
<br />
@ShadowmanX, I like your Idea to a point, but there are two gaps in the defense that I see.<br />
<br />
 1.) You are assuming that it will be a frontal attack. Most of the time when people are going to attack you, you can bet you won&#039;t know about it until after it&#039;s begun. <br />
<br />
 2.) You assume that the opponent will be slower and/or less powerful than you. If they are either your defense will be rendered useless.<br />
<br />
   There are many other flaws with your defense that I could point out, however; it isn&#039;t necessary as most attackers won&#039;t bother to think that far and will probably move on to another target before trying the other options.<br />
<br />
  @Psikillion There are attacks like the one you specified, however; There are plenty of shield that they can&#039;t pierce. It usually comes down to how well the shield is designed. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________-<br />
<br />
  Other things to note. <br />
    You can reduce the chance of people piercing through your shields by making a layered shield that is comprised of multiple shields that cover random frequencies and speeds. This method can be improved on to make a great shield that should be able to defend you long enough to get out of any situation you may get into.<br />
<br />
 Good luck - Akio</div>

Always assume that if you can do it, your opponent can do it. All I can really say as of now, you seem to have a great Idea, but all Ideas can use refining.<br />
<br />
@Psikillion<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard of people using shields that have the energy consistency of about marshmallow to act as a &quot;bullet proof&quot; vest of sorts. Other Ideas are Very well designed hard shields, reflective shields, and Reactive shields.<br />
<br />
As for Frequency and speed. It&#039;s a little difficult to explain. What I meant by frequency (as frequency was probably not the best word), is The general composition of the energy, that in which would result in a different color when looking at the shield with aura-vision or sensing the shield via any other methods. Speed is pretty obvious though, It is basically the Speed at which the energy flows within the shield itself.<br />
<br />
To expand on this Idea, one could create the shields of different consistencies (although this would likely cause disruption in the shield to an inexperienced psion), and add differet types of other programming to the layered shield setup. This would make it significantly more difficult to simply break through the defenses. Bypassing, however, is a completely different problem.<br />
<br />
Bypassing shields is essentially finding simple work around to get by a shield. For example, if there was a gap in the shield, one could bypass the shield by going through the gap. Many people look for basic bypasses (gaps or severely weak points in a shield, ways to deactivate a shield, etc.), but many won&#039;t venture further than that.<br />
<br />
Eh, I may be getting of topic here a little...any questions?<br />

@Psikillion

I&#039;ve heard of people using shields that have the energy consistency of about marshmallow to act as a &quot;bullet proof&quot; vest of sorts. Other Ideas are Very well designed hard shields, reflective shields, and Reactive shields.

As for Frequency and speed. It&#039;s a little difficult to explain. What I meant by frequency (as frequency was probably not the best word), is The general composition of the energy, that in which would result in a different color when looking at the shield with aura-vision or sensing the shield via any other methods. Speed is pretty obvious though, It is basically the Speed at which the energy flows within the shield itself.

To expand on this Idea, one could create the shields of different consistencies (although this would likely cause disruption in the shield to an inexperienced psion), and add differet types of other programming to the layered shield setup. This would make it significantly more difficult to simply break through the defenses. Bypassing, however, is a completely different problem.
