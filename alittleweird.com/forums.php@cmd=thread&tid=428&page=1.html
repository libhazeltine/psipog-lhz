Four years later I got home from a family excursion to Burger King. Being the fatty I was I set my cup down next to my TV and went to lie on my bed. Halfway through the motion of lying down I remembered I left my cut on the desk. So, thinking about why I shouldn&#039;t have to get up to get the cup and it should float to me, I decided to give it a whirl. I forrowed my brow, concentrated, and extended my arm very dramatic and tried for a good 2 minutes to move my cup to me. It didn&#039;t work. I must have been really bored/lazy after that because from then on I started researching telekinesis so I could move my cup one day if the time came. I ran into psiballs, ki, and other junk and started from there until I am where I am. It&#039;s been a part of my life since middle school. Coming up on like 6-7, or 8 years now.</div>

It has cleared up a lot of things that have happened in the past. In example, I am very empathetic and that has really affected me because I did not know it. I also have seen auras in certain instances all of my life, but never known what they were, now I do. I am very new to this, but I have been very fortunate to have a friend who was willing to share with me and to guide me in learning :) </div>

In February of 1999, there were previews on TV for the movie, &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot;.  I was browsing the internet one day, and for some reason, remembered the previews to the movie, and decided to search for &quot;telekinesis&quot;.  I found some forums where people claimed to &quot;suffer&quot; from all sorts of paranormal oddities.  Ghosts, hauntings, empathy (I think), etc.  I was honestly shocked that people out there actually claimed that they experienced these things for real, and thought they were nuts.<br />
<br />
Eventually, curiosity got the best of me, and I tried some exercises out - and got some results that I couldn&#039;t explain easily.<br />
<br />
And actually, before all this happened, I had been dabbling in self-hypnosis for a few months.  I was playing with altered states of consciousness, and just having fun.  I suppose at the time, I thought my interest in self-hypnosis and my curiosity for psychic abilities were unrelated.  I only put those pieces together years later.<br />

		<div id="post_9411" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve been lucky all my life when it comes to games of chance. I&#039;d always get favorable coin flips or dice rolls just when I needed them most, probably because I was really competitive and just HAD to win.<br />
<br />
I never believed in lucky charms or lucky items. In my opinion, everyone made their own luck. A TV show had an episode about that very thing, and for some reason I started to play with the idea of lucky objects.<br />
<br />
Being passionate in my love of wolves, wolf objects became my lucky items. I had wolf shirts and even a bunch of resin carvings and books about wolves on my headboard. I was in my mid-teens now.<br />
<br />
One day, I began to wonder where luck comes from. There&#039;s gotta be some source of power that lucky people get their luck from. So one day, I imagine my wolf items have this energy within them, just for me. I place my hand on one, and &#039;will&#039; the energy out of it, up my arm, and into the center of my chest. Once it got there, it flooded outward all throughout my body. It felt really good and intense, and even left my heart beating faster than it had been before. (This particular part of the story usually causes psychically knowledgeable people to tell me I&#039;m an energy vampire.)<br />
<br />
I began to make a habit of doing this with my wolf objects, getting to the point where I didn&#039;t need to touch them anymore, but rather just hold my arm out to them and will energy out of them all.<br />
<br />
Probably a year or two later, I begin to wonder, &quot;I can take in energy. There&#039;s gotta be something I can do with it once I have it.&quot; Inspired by Dragon Ball Z, I sat down on my bed one day and tried to make a ball of energy in my hand. I could feel the energy that I moved out of my chest and into my hand, and my hand would kinda hurt. I may have even made one. But I couldn&#039;t see anything with my eyes, so I figured it was just my imagination and gave up.<br />
<br />
A few years later, I come across Psipog. I&#039;m 19 or 20 at the time, and absolutely intrigued by the idea of psionics. I read a bunch of articles and forum posts, taking in all the information I can. But even while I did that, a lot of the information just felt... inaccurate. I took every tip and trick with my own interpretation and went with my instincts as I developed my abilities. A few months later, psipog goes down and I eventually stop paying attention to my abilities. I still knew they were there and casually did the occasional thing or two with them, but other than that, I didn&#039;t do much.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m 22 now (my birthday was a few days ago), and here I am. After searching for a few hours to see where Sean went after he closed Psipog, I finally found this place.<br />

I&#039;d been trying another forum in the past few days, and while it seems at least decently legitimate, they seem to have a strict interpretation of what can or can not be done. The general feeling there is that there&#039;s a right way to do psionics, with little room for instinctual freedom. After I saw Sean&#039;s post here about The Truth About Psionics, I knew this was the right place for me.</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_9411">I&#039;ve been lucky all my life when it comes to games of chance. I&#039;d always get favorable coin flips or dice rolls just when I needed them most, probably because I was really competitive and just HAD to win.

I never believed in lucky charms or lucky items. In my opinion, everyone made their own luck. A TV show had an episode about that very thing, and for some reason I started to play with the idea of lucky objects.

Being passionate in my love of wolves, wolf objects became my lucky items. I had wolf shirts and even a bunch of resin carvings and books about wolves on my headboard. I was in my mid-teens now.

One day, I began to wonder where luck comes from. There&#039;s gotta be some source of power that lucky people get their luck from. So one day, I imagine my wolf items have this energy within them, just for me. I place my hand on one, and &#039;will&#039; the energy out of it, up my arm, and into the center of my chest. Once it got there, it flooded outward all throughout my body. It felt really good and intense, and even left my heart beating faster than it had been before. (This particular part of the story usually causes psychically knowledgeable people to tell me I&#039;m an energy vampire.)

I began to make a habit of doing this with my wolf objects, getting to the point where I didn&#039;t need to touch them anymore, but rather just hold my arm out to them and will energy out of them all.

Probably a year or two later, I begin to wonder, &quot;I can take in energy. There&#039;s gotta be something I can do with it once I have it.&quot; Inspired by Dragon Ball Z, I sat down on my bed one day and tried to make a ball of energy in my hand. I could feel the energy that I moved out of my chest and into my hand, and my hand would kinda hurt. I may have even made one. But I couldn&#039;t see anything with my eyes, so I figured it was just my imagination and gave up.

A few years later, I come across Psipog. I&#039;m 19 or 20 at the time, and absolutely intrigued by the idea of psionics. I read a bunch of articles and forum posts, taking in all the information I can. But even while I did that, a lot of the information just felt... inaccurate. I took every tip and trick with my own interpretation and went with my instincts as I developed my abilities. A few months later, psipog goes down and I eventually stop paying attention to my abilities. I still knew they were there and casually did the occasional thing or two with them, but other than that, I didn&#039;t do much.

I&#039;m 22 now (my birthday was a few days ago), and here I am. After searching for a few hours to see where Sean went after he closed Psipog, I finally found this place.

Please amaze us with your paranormal experience stories.<br />
<br />
There are a couple down to earth people here though, I like that.<br />
<br />
Rather than making up some b.s. story that I am the chosen one or that I lifted a coach with my mind as a child or something, how about the truth?<br />
<br />
I started practicing psionics because I felt I was lacking in self-esteem and control in my life.  If I could just learn telekinesis, then I could be good enough to get attention and I could use telekinesis to help take control in my life.<br />
<br />
Thank God I matured.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong though, I believe completely in psionics.  The reason this became an option to me was when I saw my friend practicing; he was a patron of the psipog website and he was really good at it.  Since then, I&#039;ve possibly had a few psychic experiences, none of them have been telekinesis, the one I wanted the most, but they were pretty cool.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Let me add, I don&#039;t want to undermine everyone else&#039;s stories or experiences, I just definately don&#039;t believe everyone 100%.</div>
