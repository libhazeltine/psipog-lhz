<br />
The point is... I can see multiple aura&#039;s (with accurate and confirmed readings) I have extensively more physical energy as well as more capacity for energy as a whole. More physical balance, and much more.<br />
<br />
Does it really matter how I got there? So long as I got there?<br />
<br />
What I would recommend is that you try it for yourself, and if you get results, great, if you don&#039;t, also great. Either way it will mean a new found personal advancement in your life.<br />
<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Furthermore, why are you so skeptical of any one particular thing... in this matter chakras. It really doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to me as to why people are so skeptical to any one thing without first delving into every espect of the situation.<br />
<br />
Lets look at it another way. It is a truth that the human body has limits that can be broken in times of need, but are put in place to keep you from destroying yourself. This is observed in the situation of the Mother pulling the infant from the crushed car, among other things.<br />
<br />
It is also said that we only have conscious control of about 10% of the human brain normally. Although this is brought to a slight controversy as to the accuracy of the statement, it is true that there are parts of the brain that act independently of the conscious mind, such as heartbeat. These limits can also be overcome with the proper mental control... at least in theory.<br />
<br />
So wouldn&#039;t it be plausible for there to also be Limiters of energy manipulation and control?<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
On another note, it is a personal belief that the chakras may be linked to, or composed of, veins, nerves, and organs. And it is meant to, in effect, catalog the human flow of energy in the body (including radiant heat).<br />
<br />
Of course it does need editing if this is the case, so before I can do anything, I need a copy of the complete human chakra system.<br />

Were we not using it, neurons would atrophy like a muscles. To say we&#039;re only consciously aware of 10% sounds more reasonable except that its even harder to quantify than the idea that only 10% is used. I don&#039;t know that I have an objective stance on anything my brain does, I&#039;m not conscious of how the neurons activate to move a body part, when thinking, or translating sensation into the world as I understand it around me. I can override some involuntary actions sure but again I&#039;m not conscious of doing it, just that I can/am doing it.<br />

In shiatsu the meridians are capable of shifting location if the body is out of balance so even those charts are only suggestions. To interlay all the systems your talking about it would need to be pretty large image or it seem more like a mess than a system.</div>

<br />
There as also certain assumptions made about which show it is, being that eastern culture is the origin of the ideas in this form its likely that a large number incorporate it to some degree so there is a good deal of room for error in guessing.<br />
<br />
I be honest, when the conversation started I found the entire concept reminiscent of Rock Lee&#039;s ability in Naruto, mostly from the wording as the proposed effects are very different. I don&#039;t follow to much anime so my list of possibilities is small, though the american show Avatar the Last Airbender had a nice episode on chakra and meditation. The Guru, book 2, episode 19.<br />

I suppose I don&#039;t take it completely seriously, but death or insanity aren&#039;t really a problems I&#039;d worry about.
