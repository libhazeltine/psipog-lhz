		<div id="post_16014" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey friends :)<br />
Here&#039;s a BBC Health article to read that I think will interest some of you guys.<br />
It is called &quot;Phyiscal Training in your dreams&quot;<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1668247.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1668247.stm</a><br />
<br />
In spite of the title, there&#039;s nothing really about dreaming or physically training in one&#039;s dreams, however there is a relation between the topic and the title.<br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t want to read a boring BBC article (although I suggest you read it anyway to gain your own interpretation of its message, rather than just accepting mine) it says we can physically train our muscles just by visualizing we are physically training our muscles.  Doing so uses our brain to fire up motor neurons and causes actual results (In a 10 person study, a 12.5% increase was shown in muscle mass, just by imagining flexing one&#039;s arm as hard as they could over the course of a few weeks).  There were some stipulations that this type of training would not replace flexibility training and aerobic exercise, but I definitely wouldn&#039;t refute getting a little buffer solely because of my brain and neurology ;)<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts? Opinions? <br />
<br />
(I apologize if there is already a thread about this, I can honestly say I didn&#039;t check)<br />

		<div id="post_16042" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">@f3licks - Hey there buddy, about your question:<br />
&quot;I wonder how many times you have to mentally &#039;work out&#039;?&quot;<br />
(EDIT: This is really a question for everyone)<br />
<br />
Theoretically wouldn&#039;t it be safe to assume that although you don&#039;t actually have to go to the gym or physically strength train, you would still have to consistently mentally train and receive the neurological stimulus, just like when one really works out?<br />
<br />
However! -it should be noted that within the mind, there are no real limitations to the intensity in which you can work out, right? So do you think that maybe would it also safe to assume that if you can trick/control your brain/neurology into thinking you are really straining yourself to a high extent, then perhaps you could gain muscle pretty fast?<br />
<br />
(Forgive me for responding to your question with more questions)<br />
This is a question for everybody really, isn&#039;t it?<br />
What do you guys think?<br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_16042">@f3licks - Hey there buddy, about your question:
&quot;I wonder how many times you have to mentally &#039;work out&#039;?&quot;
(EDIT: This is really a question for everyone)

Theoretically wouldn&#039;t it be safe to assume that although you don&#039;t actually have to go to the gym or physically strength train, you would still have to consistently mentally train and receive the neurological stimulus, just like when one really works out?

However! -it should be noted that within the mind, there are no real limitations to the intensity in which you can work out, right? So do you think that maybe would it also safe to assume that if you can trick/control your brain/neurology into thinking you are really straining yourself to a high extent, then perhaps you could gain muscle pretty fast?

(Forgive me for responding to your question with more questions)

I don&#039;t want to be adversarial to the concept or topic of the video, especially not to the power of meditation and the mind, however the example the practicioner uses in the video in particular is very questionable, and I will tell you why. <br />
<br />
As you know, the human body is adaptive and can be very flexible. Really, any time that somebody stretches out a muscle, after breathing and letting it relax some, one can stretch out just a little further (progressively) because, in a very simple sense, you stretched out the muscle (which is why one feels strain when they stretch out). Meditation and chi ghosts are not required, and in fact when I was in high school, it was a &quot;phenomena&quot; that one of my track coaches introduced our team to, which we were able to do without such meditation or chi ghosts on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
The practicioner in the video seems to be profiteering, perhaps unknowingly, on very fundamental capabilities of the human body.  Also, it should be noted that although there are no comments criticizing his video, he also moderates the comments allowed to be viewed - strong concepts allow criticism, while he does not seem to.<br />
<br />
I apologize for posting two long posts in a row, and I definitely apologize if I appear to be trying &quot;burst anyone&#039;s bubble&quot;, I just want to present you with the facts so you can make educated observations and assumptions.<br />

@Kube <br />
&quot;And yeah, there&#039;s the fact he&#039;s trying to sell videos, that&#039;s never a good sign...&quot;<br />
Another very good point buddy ;)<br />
