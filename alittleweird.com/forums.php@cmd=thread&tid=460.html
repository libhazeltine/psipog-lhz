I probably would be very skeptical with telekinesis if I hadn&#039;t experienced it myself. I was at a friend&#039;s house and we decided to give it a shot. Nothing happened for a while until finally I made the psiwheel move a bit. I was sure it was the wind doing it so I didn&#039;t think anything of it, so I put the psiwheel inside one of those plastic cups used to store CDs in and the psiwheel still moved where I wanted it to move. I also tried blowing at it, but the wind wouldn&#039;t move it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still skeptical at the visible psiball thing. I think if someone is skilled at auric sight they could be visible (I wouldn&#039;t know since I&#039;m not skilled at all in AS), but to make a psiball visible for the untrained eye seems &quot;unprobable&quot; to me. I mean, the only type of energy we can see in nature (as far as I know) are lighting bolts, and I don&#039;t think that ammount of energy can be produced by the human body.</div>

I&#039;m still skeptical at the visible psiball thing. I think if someone is skilled at auric sight they could be visible (I wouldn&#039;t know since I&#039;m not skilled at all in AS), but to make a psiball visible for the untrained eye seems &quot;unprobable&quot; to me. I mean, the only type of energy we can see in nature (as far as I know) are lighting bolts, and I don&#039;t think that ammount of energy can be produced by the human body.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

on a side note: while i wouldn&#039;t call it a flare, there was one time when i think i saw some kind of sparks while trying a psiball. i saw quite a few, but it could&#039;ve just been that my eyes weren&#039;t working right as they were still waking up.

Hehe. I&#039;ve tried telekinesis on a penny. No results, that I can be sure of anyway. I&#039;d stand it up on its side and try to mentally tip it over.

well some people are still crazy enough to try :P<br />
while shapeshifting doesn&#039;t seem possible it still seem possible that you can cause slight changes in the way your body grows. like telling it to start growing your hair in a different color or something small that may or may-now happen other wise.<br />
like if you wanted your teeth to be stronger maybe you could get your body to increas the amount of calcium it puts into them.<br />
i don&#039;t know, i&#039;m not an expert on anything. but i think its a bad idea to place limits on things untill we have actualy tried to surpass those limits.<br />
for example, someone new to lifting weights might only be able to lift 60lb.s and think it would be immpossible to lift 200lb.s, but there are people who can lift that much and more. all i&#039;m saying is we need to try to test the limits before we can say they are realy the limits of the possiblities.</div>
