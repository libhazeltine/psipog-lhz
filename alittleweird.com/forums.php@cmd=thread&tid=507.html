		<div id="post_10680" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I struggled over if I should make a long detailed thread describing my dreams and the problem I am having, but I decided to make it short and to the point.<br />
<br />
While dreaming, if the dream ever turns into a nightmare or starts getting too out of hand for my liking, I have in the past few years developed the ability to &quot;yank&quot; my mind out of the dream and force myself to wake up. I was not always able to do this, but I have gotten better at it over a few years to the point where I can wake myself up with just a tiny flick of a thought.<br />
<br />
In the past few weeks or months (I have not been tracking it) I have encountered a very strange occurrence in my dreams. It has only happened to me 3 or maybe 4 times now, but it grows in intensity each time it happens. I will be dreaming normally, sometimes lucid and sometimes not, when suddenly the horizon will start growing very dark, like a giant ring or dome over me, and will start to shrink down to me, with me in the center. When it reaches me, everything becomes black and I can no longer see any of the dream I was in at the time. While in the blackness, I feel like I am standing in the middle of a strong wind. After a few moments, I hear what sounds like someone roaring at me. It feels very different from anything in a dream I have encountered before, and this roaring thing in the blackness seems to hate me or want to cause me harm. Of course at this point I feel very frightened so I attempt to yank myself out of the dream.<br />
<br />
The strange part about this however is that each time this event has occurred, I have been unable to wake up while it last. I have never had trouble waking myself up like this, but as much as I try to to feel my body laying in my bed, I cannot and I am trapped in the dream while in the dark with the wind blowing me around and the huge roaring yelling at me. After several seconds of panicking I wake up, though I don&#039;t know if I woke myself up or I became too scared to remain dreaming.<br />
<br />
As I stated before, each time this event has happened, it has grown stronger and lasted longer. I think the last one I just had last night lasted nearly half a minute, but it is hard for me to track time in dreams. The last event happened while I was lucid dreaming. This did not feel like a normal lucid dream though, it was the most realist lucid dream I have ever had. I actually felt like I had suddenly stepped into an entire different world, and I felt like I was actually awake. I could not feel my body in my bed at all (normally in lucid dreams I feel my body like a vague numbness). The world was interesting if I may go off topic a moment and describe it, becuase I think the events that happened there may be related to this dark event. In the dream before my lucid dream I was in a house going about my &quot;dream storyline&quot; for the night, a series of dreams that are all slightly connected by a very bizarre story. I had just stepped out of the house when I entered the lucid dream.<br />
<br />
The world was the yard behind the house with a road nearby. The grass was a deep blue color as were the trees. The sky was a very deep purple with purple and green circles of some kind like large snowflakes slowly drifting through it. As I walked across the the grass, it was so realistic that I could feel the grass bend under my shoes and hear it crunch, and I could feel the air around me. This world was so nice and so realistic that I thought to myself that I wouldn&#039;t mind staying here for a long time. So instead of rushing off to do crazy things like I normally do in a lucid dream, I sat down and tried to focus on this dream world and trying to stay in it for a long time (my goal was days). I suddenly felt as if I should look up and ask the sky if I was allowed to stay in this dream, so I did. Obviously the sky did not answer me.<br />
<br />
Then I wanted to get a better look at the world and begin to explore it. I felt as if I should ask the sky if I was allowed to fly, so I did. It was at this moment that the sky began to darken. I already knew what was coming, having experienced this event two or three times before. This darkness was different this time. It was dark storm clouds instead of just darkness. The clouds moved like smoke across the ground until I was completely circled by them. Inside was not just strong winds. The only thing I can compare it too is a hurricane. The roar was devastating, the most powerful roar I can imagine. The dream world shook from its force. I have never felt pain in dreams before, but for the first time I felt as if pain was there even though I was not feeling it. I began to scream hoping that my real body would scream and someone would come and wake me up. I was also trying again and again to force myself awake, but I could not. Eventually I seemed to white out in the dream and woke up very suddenly. That&#039;s when I thought this might be a problem I should seek advice for. If it was that bad this time, what will it be like next time?<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who has had an experience like this or heard of it before that can give me some advice? Is it something I should worry about or something I should just let happen when it does and ignore it? I&#039;m slightly annoyed at how it interrupted my best lucid dream yet.<br />

Looks like I made a long and detailed post after all.</div>

		<div id="post_10968" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So small update here. I have started sleeping only every other night, a habit I will have to break very soon (college starts this week).<br />
<br />
The other night I was having a fairly normal dream involving walking down a road, leaving a place that I cannot recall. I suddenly became lucid. So instead of walking on down the road like the dream wanted me to, I turned around to try and go back to the place I came from. What I saw behind me was a giant white wall a few feet away, slowly moving toward me. I examined the wall for a few moments and noticed that the edges of the road faded in a pixel-ish manner into the white. I somehow gained the knowledge that this white wall was the literal edge of my dream. I felt that beyond was no dream at all.<br />
<br />
Thinking that I would wake if I passed through the wall, I turned to continue on down the dream road, but the white wall sped up and passed over me. This is when things really bean to feel strange. I was without a doubt outside my dream. I could see my dream in a sort of bubble. I was floating near the dream in a black void. My dream bubble shrank and vanished, leaving me in this black void. Now, I must stress the overwhelming feeling I had that this blackness was NOT a dream. I was not dreaming or in a dream of any kind. I was floating and could feel my body (not my real body, but the one I brought with me out of the dream). I was floating with all my limbs hanging loose.<br />
<br />
At this point I was very puzzled. It was like I was lucid dreaming, but I wasn&#039;t dreaming, and yet I wasn&#039;t awake. It was like I was floating around my mind in the space where dreams exist. When I realized this, I saw another bubble begin to grow out of nowhere. I saw a bench in the bubble, then felt my arms grab onto the bench. I was then back into a normal dream, and was no longer lucid. The dream I entered was a normal dream.<br />
<br />
At least I did not encounter the black storm I described in my first post. I seem to be having very unique experiences with dreams lately.</div>

I have been in the black void you described though never in a lucid dream state, only in a meditation/daydream kind of state, so i know first hand what you are talking about, if the void is related to your blackstorm perhaps your mind has been trying to kick you out of your dreams for being lucid and breaking the order of your mind.</div>

		<div id="post_11107" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">well, I would just let your mind quiet down a bit (meditation is helpful) until you don&#039;t have any thoughts really going through... this is to insure no background noise as tyou ask, then, in your head, ask a question... if you relax, you&#039;ll get an answer ^_^.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d start with more relaxing questions, if the &quot;storm&quot; is uneasing for you ^_-. It&#039;s great to be in contact with your subconscious, it&#039;s your best critic and is always truthful ^_^.<br />

		<div id="post_11792" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">So I dug this topic up to discuss my latest strange dream. It was a Friday morning and school was out, but my alarm woke me up early anyway. So I went back to sleep: perfect chance for lucid dreaming. I went lucid right away. I managed to stay lucid for a very long time, longer than normal, because I discovered a new trick (new for me anyway).<br />
<br />
During the lucid dream, I noticed I had my crystal egg that I own with me in the dream, held in my right hand. Whenever things in the dream would become blurry or unfocused (my usual signs of waking up) I would look at the crystal egg and focus on it. If the egg was blurry or misshapen I would concentrate until it became clear and egged shaped, and then the rest of the dream would become clear.<br />
<br />
One of the many things I tried during this dream was using psi on the egg. I would try to push psi into it or do anything else. All my attempts were met with failure.<br />
<br />
Here is the strange part. Eventually I was unable to stay focused and woke up. I was laying on my left side with my right hand under the pillow. My eyes were slightly open and I knew I was awake, so I tried to remain still and go back to sleep. It was then I noticed that ...the crystal egg was still in my right hand. I squeezed it to make sure and I couldn&#039;t close my right hand. So I sat up and pulled my hand out from under the pillow. As I did, I felt the egg &quot;melt away&quot; in my hand and when I looked my hand was empty.<br />
<br />
Now, I know almost all of you are thinking &quot;false awakening&quot; right now. I don&#039;t think that is what it was. When I had the egg in my hand under the pillow, my eyes were open. My eyes were still open when the egg vanished. There was no second awakening between the two. After it vanished I got up and went about my day, with my real crystal egg being were it belonged on the shelf.<br />
<br />
I have two theories. The first is I was in a state opposite of lucid dreaming in which I am awake but small elements of dreams appear around me as hallucinations. The other theory is that when practicing psi in my dream, I accidentally created a construct in my real hand that remained when I woke up. What do you guys think? It should be noted that I have never had a false awakening that I know of/can remember, and I am terrible at making constructs.</div>
