		<div id="post_16342" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">     Now I know I just posted 3 (counting this one) threads within the same year.....almost...but I really need to know something. I&#039;m not exactly sure if any of you have the same thing as me, but I feel like I have to be there for everyone otherwise something bad might happen to them.<br />
<br />
     My dad usually does flooring but recently he&#039;s needed to do roofing...on airplane hangars....big ones...I was worried at first, but not too much...that is, until he took us to where he does it. I &quot;saw&quot; my dad walking on the roof, and slip. They have harnesses but his broke and he plummeted to the ground. I was pulled back into reality when we reached the restaurant we were gonna have dinner at. I haven&#039;t been this worried about dad since his super cramps a few months ago. <br />
<br />
     Anyways, my grandma, whom I call &quot;Tutu&quot; because she&#039;s from my mom&#039;s [Hawaiian] side, is about 81 years old, and I worry about her alot. Just like dad, I see her having strokes, or heart attacks, or something really bad happening to her. Whenever this happens, I can&#039;t stop it. No matter what I try, it never stops on my command. It stops on it&#039;s own. But I still see the images. You guys gotta help me figure out what the hell is happening, why it&#039;s happening, and how to stop it...I&#039;ll get down on my knees and beg if I have to, just make it stop. I don&#039;t wanna see the death of someone I love a thousand times before it really does happen. Until then, peace...</div>

Because of this fear you are actively imagining these things happening. Why? I don&#039;t know. Maybe ask yourself that.<br />
<br />
Life is unforgiving. Just as I will die, my family will die. Some sooner than me, some after me. Some by accident, some by old age. This is life. <br />
<br />
Let go and accept it, and these images will probably stop happening.<br />

But I&#039;m not a doctor. If you&#039;re really feeling bad about these things, perhaps you should speak to a professional a therapist or psychologist or something. </div>
