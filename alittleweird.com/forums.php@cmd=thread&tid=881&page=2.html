		<div id="post_15883" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Alright, so we have a few other suggestions:<br />
<br />
I added this first one to the list, but it seems most aren&#039;t paying much attention to it ,so I&#039;ll post it here: Maybe we should get an empath or two to do the interviews. That way we can pick up the applicant&#039;s feelings and how they deal with pressure. Of course, we&#039;d have to get a live interview for this, not an application form.<br />
<br />
Next, from Falcon:<br />
<br />
Maybe we should also teach Magic. Falcon&#039;s volunteered to teach it, even if it means teaching it alone at first.<br />
<br />
I wanted to put the emphasis on that last one because let&#039;s remember this project originated from the fact that psionics needs a bit of a reset to get going again, whereas magic and it&#039;s basics are already pretty solid. I&#039;m still not sure if this is a good idea, as once we start dividing our efforts into too many different directions, we&#039;ll start losing our organization and that could end up screwing up everything. But I still haven&#039;t got a fixed idea on this and we should all voice our opinion first before taking or leaving it.<br />
<br />
Third, from Falcon again: Maybe we should keep it to the forums. In a way, I agree, maybe it&#039;s better if we just get a forum hosted on a free host, register a free domain and get it going. If I&#039;m to administrate the forums, all we need is a name and I can get this ball rolling, hell I could do this tomorrow if you want, I&#039;ve done it before and I&#039;ve already found a free forum host/builder we could use. The forums-only idea could work better for the articles, we wouldn&#039;t have to deal with the extra trouble of posting on blogs, updating the main page and all that. It&#039;s also a breeze on those forum creators to create private/hidden sections for different groups. When a student reaches the privilege needed to enter a section, we just sign him/her into that section&#039;s group and the work&#039;s done. Of course, if we add in Magic, we&#039;re leaving behind the Psi Academy name and we&#039;re left with New Beginnings, so don&#039;t forget to post yours if you don&#039;t agree with one of the two.<br />
<br />
PS: Remember if you want to talk directly and learn to know each other better, add your IMs, email addresses or whatever to the thread so we can all communicate more easily instead of just hoping the others will read our posts.</div>

Sure you&#039;d have to take care of a lot of people at once, but if you&#039;re actually there with them, you can answer &#039;on the spot&#039; questions others might be too afraid to state on a large forum everyone could see at any time.

		<div id="post_15902" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Dash and Kube, it depends on the system of magic you are trying to teach. To use myself as an example, the system of magic I teach is pretty close to Psionics, since it starts with basic mental control, and gradually moves to more advanced subjects. Below, I tried to point out the greatest similarities and differences between them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Similarities:</strong><br />
- In the system of magic I teach, I focus a lot on achieving mental control, &#039;direct magic&#039; as some might call it, meaning one should not use rituals and the like at first, ritual should only be done when it can be understood completely, and once the basic occult faculties have been trained sufficiently.<br />
<br />
<strong>Differences:</strong><br />
- The focus on spiritual development, opposed to just gaining magical powers. In the system of magic I teach (which more or less originated from original Hermetics), we incorporate working on the &#039;balance&#039; of the character. We believe that the greater the balance of the character, (which is called the elemental equipoise, though there is too much to be said about this subject to deal with it here,) the greater the abilities of the magician. <br />
- The use of a spirit-energy model instead of pure-energy model. The difference between those two models is practically that the spirit-energy model (Hermetics) allows the magician to evocate spiritual and astral entities later in his training, whereas the pure-energy model (Psionics) uses constructs at best, and only raw energy at worst. (Though some might disagree, this is what I generally see as a major flaw in Psionics.)<br />
<br />
Let me make this clear, people WILL be divided if you let them practice two different systems, Psionics and Magic. The question raises, however, where is the line? Can we draw a clear line between them, or do they merge (partially) into each other? So, it&#039;s up to you, depending on what your goals are with this school. If it is primarily, as stated before, trying to revive Psionics again, then I personally think adding Magic to it will not be a good thing to do. If there is something else you are trying to achieve (as well) however, then, who knows, adding Magic might just be what you need.<br />

Alright so:<br />
<br />
#1 Google Docs: Is there a way, SL, to access the docs if you&#039;re not directly linked to it by the author(s)? Because what you&#039;ve described sounds perfect, we could just make one &quot;Articles&quot; thread for every section of the forums and put down links to all the relevant articles as they get published. But if you can go to them without being linked or being the author, in come the newbies. That would be the only flaw I see if it exists.<br />
<br />
#2 Plugs: I&#039;m of Dash&#039;s opinion, plugs aren&#039;t a good idea, but yeah, they would get credit. But let&#039;s remember this is a free school, we don&#039;t want people to feel like they have to buy stuff to have a complete course. (Just repeating what Dash said lol) That&#039;s what happens if you collaborate with professionals, they&#039;ll try to sell their products. I&#039;m not against it; it&#039;s their job, but we might want to steer away from that.<br />
<br />
#3 Magic: Dash pretty much said it all. The more I think of this, the more I make up my mind and right now the results point to a no.<br />
<br />
#4 IRC: Yeah, there&#039;s no doubt an IRC would be better suited to give classes. Let&#039;s use the free IRC Reniiji posted.<br />
<br />
So I suppose we&#039;ve settled on a forum-only website with a joint IRC (The forum host I was going to use was forumotion.com) Just tell me if everyone agrees on this so I can fix the list on the first page.</div>

Let me make this clear, people WILL be divided if you let them practice two different systems, Psionics and Magic. The question raises, however, where is the line? Can we draw a clear line between them, or do they merge (partially) into each other? So, it&#039;s up to you, depending on what your goals are with this school. If it is primarily, as stated before, trying to revive Psionics again, then I personally think adding Magic to it will not be a good thing to do. If there is something else you are trying to achieve (as well) however, then, who knows, adding Magic might just be what you need.<br />

First off, I didn&#039;t say I entirely forget about anything.  You put those words in my mouth.<br />
Second, when I said I wasn&#039;t sure how to do them, I was referring to my body or mind being used to the certain feelings or processes that have to take place for the skill.<br />

I can&#039;t remember the feeling, but I can remember its existence.    Same with Lucid Dreaming and OBEs.<br />

I know I could pick them back up, but if I were to try them -right now-,  I wouldn&#039;t know exactly what to do without those feelings.  I wouldn&#039;t be &quot;100% sure&quot;..<br />
