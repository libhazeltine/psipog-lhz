Favorite Music: Alternative, Rock, and some Pop.<br />
<br />
Favorite Color: I love green, and actually, I wear it about every day, my second favorite color is orange (Which looks horrible on me!).<br />
<br />
Favorite Book: Any book in the Harry Potter series, but I guess my favorite in the series itself would have to be book 5: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.<br />
<br />
Hobbies: Well, I have a black belt in karate, and love to write, especially poetry. I also like softball and most sports. And of course, psionics.<br />
<br />
Photo: None at the moment.<br />
<br />
Reason you are here: I&#039;m very interested in psionics and want to meet other people who&#039;ve had similar experiences. I found PsiPog awhile after it was shut down, and found it helpful, so I finally decided to register here =P<br />
<br />
Psionic Abilities: I&#039;d consider myself a natural at Empathy, and there are some fields of it I don&#039;t know exactly what to name... I can make some basic contructs, but really need to pratice more. No telekinetic abilities yet, but I hope to learn.<br />
