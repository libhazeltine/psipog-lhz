		<div id="post_13727" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I think that the human communication by speech (words and sounds) is being each time more ineffective and inefficient as we try to advance in areas of highly &#039;abstract&#039; or mind related like learning/teaching psychic abilities. That&#039;s my theory to explain why people learn these things at different rates, why there&#039;s the infamous Analytical Overlay, why there are so many techniques and beliefs (and why they work for some only) and such. Things that require experience (not talking about trial-and-error), certain specific-first-hand knowledge, understand the handling of emotions/thoughts/senses, etc....<br />
<br />
The problem is that words and speech are too ambiguous and general (without speaking of the lack of enough concepts because of the inability to describe them). For example (a practical one): <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a cake.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s a cake.<br />
<br />
When you read &quot;cake&quot; the brain, depending on people, may handle and/or associate that word as a bit of information only (without any kind of anything than the &quot;impression that&#039;s a cake&quot;), a  picture, a smell, a sound (why not?), a taste, a touch, an emotion, a special feeling, a memory or a mixture of them.<br />
Then when you read the &quot;There&#039;s a(...)&quot; a different processing approach cames up.<br />
This is a lot of trouble already and we should bear in mind (among other things like the belief system) that however the &quot;cake&quot; is being handled it will be handled differently even from people whose brain uses the same approach to the word &quot;cake&quot;, for example: Person A reads &quot;cake&quot; and imagines a Strawberry Pie, but Person B reads &quot;cake&quot; and imagines a Chocolate Cake.<br />
When you see the picture of a &quot;cake&quot; there&#039;s a lot of less ambiguity: &quot;It&#039;s made of chocolate!&quot; Person A says.<br />
But does Person C notices that&#039;s a cake? Does he even knows what &quot;cakes&quot; are? Here we have what I&#039;ve been talking about: past experiences, notion, knowledge, etc....<br />
<br />
How to overcome that? I&#039;ve once made a thought experiment:<br />
Two people are in  a room. Person A is teaching Person B how to make psiballs.<br />
A says B to channel it&#039;s energy (or psi) to his hands and concentrate it there. B says &quot;WTF?&quot;.<br />
A tries a different technique: &quot;imagine your energy in you, and then imagine it flowing to your hands (blah, blah)&quot;. B asks: &quot;How is that energy?&quot;, &quot;Where does it cames from?&quot;, &quot;Blah, Blah&quot;.<br />
So, again, A tries some technique improvements: &quot;Make all that as you feel better, follow your instinct&quot;. This may lead to B thinking he is doing it right when, he&#039;s only pretending stuff. So where&#039;s the <strong>intention</strong>, sensing the realm of psi and the real work of understanding and &quot;talking&quot; with the subconscious? Unfortunely A don&#039;t knows how this works or how to explain this, he just does it. But it still does it!<br />
What if B already knew empathy (the telepathic kind) and telepathy? That would be a lot more easy! A could make kind of a virtual room with his imagination and project all his emotions, intentions and everything else to B, because he would &#039;feel&#039; all that.<br />
<br />
Back to our Cake example (hope you are not hungry :D):<br />
A writes down cake for B to read, but this time tells him to feel his notions of &quot;cake&quot; before reading. If B&#039;s successful (supposedly) he&#039;ll say (in this case): &quot;The grandma&#039;s fluffy-yellow-great-tasting cake! From 2005&#039;s my (Person A not B)birthday.&quot;, then he could reply: &quot;OMG, I felt how good is that nasty cake!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the end he learns how to appreciate grandma&#039;s cake and how to make psiballs because he &quot;saw&quot; the gears of a machine working, not the buttons that make the gears rotate behind the plastic case (if you know what I mean).<br />
<br />
The inefficiency of speech is like this large post for some simple concept. The ineffectiveness is using expressions like &quot;just knowing&quot; where there&#039;s no actual word that directly leads to understanding what I&#039;m talking about.<br />
<br />
This is a large post, but it would be shorter if in pictures, sounds and &quot;just knowing&quot;. Thanks for reading (if you made it).</div>

Though you absolutely made a point why Psionics is hard in some way, I think most people could learn Psionics much easier by first learning good concentration and visualisation, before moving on to a thing such as EM. <br />
<br />
So, in my opinion, you made a good point, however, I would like to see whether you still think Psionics is hard to teach/learn when some of the techniques become more refined. (Or: Start with some meditative skills instead of tactical-feedback-based-EM-which-isn&#039;t-EM-at-all.) I am sure this would make a huge difference.<br />

Wouldn&#039;t you have to teach somebody telepathy first before you can teach them at all?  Eh, telepathy isn&#039;t that hard to teach anyways.  If anyone recalls him, I essentially taught Nvivas how to do basic telepathy.  While he had read the stuff off of Psipog already, he didn&#039;t quite get it.

		<div id="post_13736" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">It&#039;s true that&#039;s a paradox: learning telepathy first then the other stuff when we hear from PsiPog for example that telepathy is an &quot;advanced technique&quot;. Before continuing my line of thought I must make Raathuus notice that Telepathy is not one of the most easier skills for some people. But there&#039;s a clue that leads to telepathy: the natural empathy which in some people like myself is developed naturally and for everyone is something common and noticeable for at a certain degree.<br />
<br />
When I started in psionics I&#039;ve wondered if mental skills like telekinesis happen when in the right state of mind and &quot;feeling&quot; was triggered, BTW it was there when (and why) I tried to force certain states of mind (unlike I did is not a good thing to start with in my experience). I was about to join a forum to ask how does telekinesis feels like (and similar questions) when I came up with that question already discussed with another rookie. The answer in short: &quot;I can&#039;t explain really&quot;. That was when I first started reflecting about this subject: &quot;I can understand why he (or she; I dunno)&#039;s unable to express that by <strong>words</strong>. And if I could feel what he feels and record that in my memory?&quot; those were my first thoughts. Latter I asked myself about the primitive and ancient people, the ones who started to speak about &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;witchcraft&quot; and &quot;super powers&quot;. I&#039;ve never rejected the idea that if psychic skills are real then they weren&#039;t something natural and native in human functioning, so if there was I time where these skills were as common and/or mundane as speaking is today then how they used to teach to each other? And maybe (in spite of that being very wild): how did they communicated without complex speech.<br />
We have more clues: <br />
-Our mind is able to accept tools and objects as extensions of our bodies (even to the point of knowing how to make the body work like that object or, the reverse, make the object work like some body part. In simplistic sense). <br />
<br />
-When we are very young our minds interprets the other peoples emotions and behaviour to understand if something is bad or good and how it should be made (basically, to learn).<br />
<br />
Those mimicry abilities may not be telepathy, but they are examples of how the mind tries to get closer to something/someone else capabilities. What would make any kind of complex system like our brain to reach out of its limits (if without the Telepathic and Empathic skills) if there weren&#039;t anything to support it (or give any value to make such effort).<br />
<br />
IMO this post is a bit confusing. I&#039;ll try to make it simpler next time, because now is late for me.</div>

What would make any kind of complex system like our brain to reach out of its limits (if without the Telepathic and Empathic skills) if there weren&#039;t anything to support it (or give any value to make such effort).

IMO this post is a bit confusing. I&#039;ll try to make it simpler next time, because now is late for me.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

I&#039;m currently developing a new way of learning psionics using NLP. NLP has been used a lot for learning people stuff (like in the army, to improve the aiming (with a gun) of soldiers). I&#039;ll post an article about it in this forum, and probably other OEC-sites as well.</div>

Still I don&#039;t see properly how this could relate with the Chaos Theory. It&#039;s true that words are a &quot;mess&quot;, but they are made up of sounds (that obviously later become symbols) to name concepts. Imagine that the language was invented in one day from only one person. The Language Inventor natively used to communicate by squishes, then he decided to make a more articulated speech. First: he sees an object that&#039;s called &quot;gracsh&quot; but now he wants to call it &quot;rock&quot;. What I mean is that the definition of concepts is static, but the word for it is nothing but thin air, they make sense only because they were fitted in a system that tells us that the words are static too (although that&#039;s not very true), that&#039;s just a way to simplify the mess.</div>

This also proves why words become so invalid because multiple words can have the same meaning ultimately but not situational to the event or retrospective to the person, or group of people.

I see you get one of the key points of my theory.
Still I don&#039;t see properly how this could relate with the Chaos Theory. It&#039;s true that words are a &quot;mess&quot;, but they are made up of sounds (that obviously later become symbols) to name concepts. Imagine that the language was invented in one day from only one person. The Language Inventor natively used to communicate by squishes, then he decided to make a more articulated speech. First: he sees an object that&#039;s called &quot;gracsh&quot; but now he wants to call it &quot;rock&quot;. What I mean is that the definition of concepts is static, but the word for it is nothing but thin air, they make sense only because they were fitted in a system that tells us that the words are static too (although that&#039;s not very true), that&#039;s just a way to simplify the mess.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Now think this: what if the mechanisms of telepathy were this ones? Then prayer (that is a systematic re-impressioning of feelings/emotions/wishes) that affects the Unit will work like telepathy (or something similar).</div><div style="border: 1px solid #555; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px; padding: 10px; font-size: 90%;"><em>posted by DigGil:</em><br />
