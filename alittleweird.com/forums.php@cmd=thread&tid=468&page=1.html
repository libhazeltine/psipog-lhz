Yeah, it&#039;s the same basic Idea ^_^<br />
<br />
Think of time as water flowing through a hose, and your perception of time as a hand gripping the hose itself. The more perception of time passing that you have, the tighter you grip the hose and the slower time flows, and the less perception of time you have, the faster time flows.<br />
<br />

<br />
Losing track of time is a little self-explanatory.<br />
<br />
To put it in more complicated terms, your perception of time itself controls the flow of time for you ^_^, don&#039;t actually picture a hand holding a hose, but rather control and alter your perception of time.<br />

<br />
I think increasing your understanding of time could help you if you were trying to control it.  <br />
<br />
Space and Time are said to be &quot;linked&quot;, in that they affect each other.  Time moves slower around things with higher mass (and things that are being accelerated, because high mass has the same affects as high acceleration, but you can ignore that for now haha).  For example, say there are 2 planets: a small planet and a large planet, both have people living on them.<br />
<img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h136/savemydonkey/foto2.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
The people on the large planet will age MUCH slower than the people on the small planet because time is distorted by things with a larger mass.  The heavier something is, the harder it is for the progression of time to pass through, therefore time moves slower around things with higher mass. If you think as Space and Time being 2 overlapping sheets, if you place something big on the sheets, both of them will wrinkle and skew a bit around the object, that how Time is skewed:<br />
<img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h136/savemydonkey/foto3.jpg" alt="External Image" /><br />
(This is HUGELY oversimplified, in reality it would be like 2 overlapping oceans, within each other).  <br />
<br />
So! Now that we have that understanding, theories about how time control might work?<br />
If there was some way to replicate the effects of high mass using some psionic ability or psi, that might be a way.  Almost like &quot;tricking&quot; time into skewing (or not skewing!).<br />
Also, as I mentioned before, high acceleration has the same physical effects as high mass, so if you could somehow replicate the effects of high acceleration, that might be another way to &quot;trick&quot; time into skewing (or not unskewing!).<br />
Perhaps a type of psionic vibration could help with the acceleration thing...<br />
I&#039;ve contributed all I can for now, Good luck!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Let me add btw, the amount that time is skewed by mass is MINISCULE.  Let me also remind you, there is a difference between attempting to control time and controlling your perception of time.  Akio&#039;s got the perception thing down to a hose ;).</div>

<br />
I believe we are stumbling upon Einstein&#039;s theory of special relativity.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to go over the entire thing because this area of physics is long and very complicated. I&#039;m already having a hard time wrapping my head around this subject.<br />
<br />
What you are referring to is called Time Dilation. In simple terms, Time Dilation is when time itself moves slower IN THE PERSPECTIVE of an outside observer.  The mass of an object does not necessarily matter. <br />
<br />
If we take a closer look at the simple Time Dilation Equation we can see mass of the object does not matter. <br />
<br />
 γ = 1 / √(1 - β²)   where β = v / c     v is the velocity <br />
                                         c is the speed of light. <br />
<br />
There is another area in the subject called Relativistic mass which somewhat agrees with what you were talking about, but in the case of Time Dilation, mass is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Basically, what this theory says is that closer you travel to the speed of light, the more slower time goes. <br />
<br />
Heres a common application. <br />
Lets say you have a twin and you are both 18 years old, born on the exact same day etc. when suddenly, your twin decides to go on a space adventure! He takes off at the speed of 70% the speed of light. When he returns to earth 40 years later, he will only be in his mid 30&#039;s while you yourself will be past 40! <br />
If you were to somehow observe him during his trip, you would notice his heart beating slowly. 1 second in his time will seem equivalent to 3 seconds in your time. However, in your twin&#039;s perspective, 1 second will be equivalent to 1 second, and his heartbeat will be beating at a normal rate. <br />
<br />
That means Time Dilation is only noticeable by outside observer, which then leads us to ask ourselves, &quot;what is the absolute time speed?&quot; or &quot;what if our time itself is being dilated, according to some aliens watching us from far away? afterall, the earth is moving constantly around the sun, which then must mean that I am not in the same spot, but rather moving at several thousand kilometers per hour while at the same time typing this over the internet. But then...if i&#039;m not really moving anywhere, according to most people, what speed am I really moving at and OMG brainfog @_@ <br />
Gotta love science :P <br />
<br />
but anyways, as for any practical psionic use for this, i&#039;d say there isn&#039;t any, unless you can somehow manage to move yourself close to the speed of light, which is next to impossible last time i checked. </div>

 γ = 1 / √(1 - β²)   where β = v / c     v is the velocity 
                                         c is the speed of light. 

There is another area in the subject called Relativistic mass which somewhat agrees with what you were talking about, but in the case of Time Dilation, mass is irrelevant. 

Basically, what this theory says is that closer you travel to the speed of light, the more slower time goes. 

Heres a common application. 
Lets say you have a twin and you are both 18 years old, born on the exact same day etc. when suddenly, your twin decides to go on a space adventure! He takes off at the speed of 70% the speed of light. When he returns to earth 40 years later, he will only be in his mid 30&#039;s while you yourself will be past 40! 
If you were to somehow observe him during his trip, you would notice his heart beating slowly. 1 second in his time will seem equivalent to 3 seconds in your time. However, in your twin&#039;s perspective, 1 second will be equivalent to 1 second, and his heartbeat will be beating at a normal rate. 

That means Time Dilation is only noticeable by outside observer, which then leads us to ask ourselves, &quot;what is the absolute time speed?&quot; or &quot;what if our time itself is being dilated, according to some aliens watching us from far away? afterall, the earth is moving constantly around the sun, which then must mean that I am not in the same spot, but rather moving at several thousand kilometers per hour while at the same time typing this over the internet. But then...if i&#039;m not really moving anywhere, according to most people, what speed am I really moving at and OMG brainfog @_@ 
Gotta love science :P 

but anyways, as for any practical psionic use for this, i&#039;d say there isn&#039;t any, unless you can somehow manage to move yourself close to the speed of light, which is next to impossible last time i checked.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

well it doesn&#039;t really increase or decrease the actual time, instead it changes your perspective of time. for example, if you used chronokinesis to slow down time,you would appear to others to be moving faster than normal.</div>In my previous post, I am addressing the poster&#039;s definition.<br />

<br />
My technique are : <br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
- When I want to speed up, I visualize everyone around me talk in raising their voice tone to a squeeky high-speed ( like when forwarding song/movie ) and me just walking fast. It did worked as I tried it in class and the teacher was talking and began to speed up her talking speed without anyone else to stop her from mambeling ( because it was only me in high-speed  :P ).<br />
<br />
- When I want to slow things down, I viualize a slow-motion music like the sound of a vacuum cleaner ( very slow speed ) , visualize everyone doing everything slower and me continiue my daily routine like nothing is happening. It also worked on my class while a lesson.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
But this skill isn&#039;t usefull as I thought...<br />
Like when the teacher is dictating too fast ( History class ~_~  ) and I want to slow her down - it&#039;s just too hard concentrating on slowing time  plus what was she saying .  Also, Iv&#039;e heard and experienced that as you control chronokinesis it&#039;s can become a burden. like when you&#039;r sad time will go slower or when you&#039;r mad time will speed and become annoying and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope I helped you to get a better view at that skill, GOOD LUCK :D ! </div>
