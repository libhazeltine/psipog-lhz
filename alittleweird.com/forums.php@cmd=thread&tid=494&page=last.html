<br />
Like, do you think they are:<br />
<br />
a) Faking it all for the sake of interesting TV<br />
b) It&#039;s all really real<br />
c) The people on the show are accidentally causing the events to happen using PK without realizing<br />
d) Other<br />
<br />
Personally, I don&#039;t really believe in ghosts, but I do believe in energy remains (not like a residual haunting, but a feeling like a person once in the room was feeling.) I try to keep an open mind though ;P It&#039;s just that it&#039;s so incredibly easy to fake stuff nowadays.. You know the saying &quot;Keep an open mind, but don&#039;t let your brain fall out.&quot;<br />

I might have seen a ghost once when I was younger, dunno what it was though. Heres the story...<br />
<br />
I was playing with my brother (or what I thought was my brother), and he ran upstairs. I didn&#039;t really realize it at the time, but he was kind of shadowy, slowly getting darker, and he ran super fast. I chased after him and told him to wait up, but he didn&#039;t. The thing ran into my room. By this time I was getting the whole &quot;Oh crap something is really wrong here&quot; feeling. I cautiously walked into my room and I saw it sitting on my bed, legs spread in a medium v, forearms on his thighs, kind of slouched but I knew it was looking at me. It was about the size of an adult, def not my brother. I flicked on the light and no one was there.<br />

Well in the first place it would be impossible to determine from just your story if you saw a ghost. In addition to your other post about conversing with a male in your mind its not out of the question to suppose that this is another hallucination. Which leads me to be a tad concerned for you.</div>

I read through it, and I don&#039;t really have any of the symptoms. If I do have any disorder, it&#039;s depression...
