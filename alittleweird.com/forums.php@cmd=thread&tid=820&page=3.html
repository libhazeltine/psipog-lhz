Yeah, full moon! Too bad it&#039;s not really clear around here... The moon&#039;s always there around 11 PM, then after midnight, I&#039;d have to go a ways from my house or else it&#039;s hidden behind trees. After like 2 AM it&#039;s almost not visible... after that, it&#039;s already down. But thanks for reminding me!

Yeah, I have a moon tracker on my windows sidebar, and I added the Full Moon fan page which sends an update every time the full moon is happening.<br />

Also out of curiosity, whenever my dog gets into different moods I can smell the change. Is that normal? I looked it up on Google and all I found was dogs smelling people :/</div>

<br />
Because they say that animals can smell the emotions (usually fear), and you say you&#039;ve tried to shift mindsets to a wolf&#039;s right? There might be a connection there...<br />

		<div id="post_14865" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Of course, this could be a valuable mechanism to see if past experience were &quot;self-created&quot;. For example, if you &quot;shifted&quot; and believed yourself to be a &quot;werecat&quot; or whatever you want to call it, and had perceived better eyesight, then we could conclude that was a delusion ... a self created experience.(Or you could say you are a &quot;were-eagle&quot; :-/) <br />
<br />
A defensive response to this thought may be to gather as much data on the animal as possible, creating the &quot;right&quot; expectations. It&#039;s almost the same situation as people scrying into the past. Except, one would rather research AFTER the experience than beforehand, simply to know the truth of ones ability or status. Whereas this type of thing may lead to self delusion. A simple desire to &quot;be&quot; something else. <br />
<br />
So I suppose my advice to you is to simply check what it is you experience, and see whether it corresponds factually to things.<br />

My thoughts on the sensing by smell the dog, is that ya activated somehow the werewolf scent nose that can smell slight scents at a distance and its for tracking too. An idea is that we werewolves are capable of the scenting of unusual things that arent exactly possible to the normal human.</div>

So, yeah, last night I thought I&#039;d try my best, since it was the full moon and all, and I tried to do it when I was fully awake. Nothing happened except for the usual feelings, so I tried again and again every hour or so. Then I went to bed, as usual couldn&#039;t sleep. At around 4/5AM, I decided I&#039;d try again, since last time, if it really was a p-shift, (info&#039;s on my blog), I fell asleep soon after. So I tried doing it and you know when you try to get an OBE and you start hearing things and stuff like that? Recently, ever since I&#039;ve started to try p-shifting, actually, I don&#039;t hear voices or phones ringing as usual: I hear growls, howls, stuff like that! I tried again this morning. After a while of having the same hallucinations, I heard this growl that sounded much realer than the ones before. Then I realized it wasn&#039;t a hallucination this time: I was growling.<br />
<br />
I was surprised, so I sat up and then it all stopped.<br />
<br />
When you&#039;re drowsy, your mind plays tricks on you, though, so I&#039;ll just try again and again and see what happens.<br />
