		<div id="post_10551" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I was wondering what everybody thought of religion. What you were brought up as, what you felt about it, how much of an impact on your development in psionics did it have, questions about it others can talk about, the like.<br />
<br />
As a slight side topic, how did everyone grow up in regards to psionics? Like did you grow up with your parents telling you they were real, fake/imaginary, or bad? And how do you see it?<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
I was brought up as a Christian, and I still consider myself one at this point in time. I try my hardest to not be a hypocrite, and to be the same person everywhere I go. I kinda had to get that out of the way, &#039;cause a lot of so called &quot;Christians&quot; are not the kind of people I&#039;d even want to be aquaintances with.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always felt a bit unsure about it, but for me there hasn&#039;t really been any question about &quot;what God&quot; its more like &quot;which God?&quot; Questions later.<br />
<br />
It hasn&#039;t really hindered me, though I have had some thoughts like, &quot;Is what I can do considered witchcraft?&quot; but I don&#039;t think it is because I&#039;m not calling on the Devil or whatever.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
<em>For Christianity</em><br />
<br />
-If God knows what&#039;s going to happen, why doesn&#039;t he stop bad stuff?<br />
<br />
-God created everything, even Satan. How did a God that was purely good somehow develop evil?<br />
<br />
-God knows who is going to accept him and who isn&#039;t. Why doesn&#039;t he avoid creating those who won&#039;t accept him and spare them from eternal torment?<br />
<br />
-Does God make the opportunity to accept him equal? Everyone&#039;s circumstances are different, but do we all balance in some way?<br />
<br />
<em>For Buddhism</em><br />
<br />
-Buddha has reached the state where he doesn&#039;t have to reincarnate anymore, so why do people still look for the &quot;reincarnated Buddha&quot;?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll come up with more questions later...<br />
<br />
I was always told that psychics were fake (and I think a lot of them are, but not all), the abilities weren&#039;t real, and if they were it was either from God or Satan, but not yourself. I think that has defenitly stunted my growth, because when I started to get the urge to figure out for myself what was true and all, I was out of my child growing stage where learning is easy.</div>

I&#039;m entertained by the strangeness of Christianity. When the apostles were granted the holy spirit they were possessed and spoke in the languages they didn&#039;t know so that the crowd could hear their message. The prophecies of the old testament are proof of Jesus being the son of god. However, in the modern world many groups consider speaking in tongues and prophecy as gifts of evil origin.. Its hilarious these groups rationalize away the conflict. You resurface from baptism speaking psalm 23 in Greek or Hebrew and the priest is likely to try dunking you again if no one knows it. :P<br />

My mother and father are Christian, but they were pretty loose about it. My mother has always had a interest in ghost stories, psychics and magic like in King Arthur. Personally I think all the children of Abraham are coming from a incompletely enlightened philosophy. It has its good points, but the only god is never a sound assumption to make when it comes to trying to unite people.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I shift between skepticism and belief in a more Buddhist cosmology. I want to KNOW, so I try to maintain skepticism but its obvious when I dig for an answer that I&#039;m trying to find something mystic yet quantifiable rather than seeking an objective truth.</div>

My mother and father are Christian, but they were pretty loose about it. My mother has always had a interest in ghost stories, psychics and magic like in King Arthur. Personally I think all the children of Abraham are coming from a incompletely enlightened philosophy. It has its good points, but the only god is never a sound assumption to make when it comes to trying to unite people.</div>lol i havent been baptized yet.. hope my pastor doesnt do that xD<br />
<br />
prehaps God is not trying to unite people...i think this life is just a choice of him or not, so it doesnt really matter if everyone is unified. if he was trying to unite people, im pretty sure he could have done a much better job of it =P<br />
<br />
im interested in exactly what you beleive.. i have a book on major world religions, but it was written by a Christian, so obviously there&#039;s a slant to it...i should read the section on Buddhism again, i bet ill have more questions for you :)</div>

		<div id="post_10558" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">In regards to evil having an orgin...The root of evil is Satan. Satan was an angel who began to desire and regard himself equal to God. Therefore he fell/was cast out of heaven. The root of evil is there, with the sin of Lucifer, who then fostered it in Eve, who kindly inflicted it upon all of humanity. Thus, a world that was intended to be perfect fell away from it. Evil was not a premeditated thing. I would think that God knew it would happen, since He knows what is going to happen, remember, everything is a part of His plan, crafted before the beginning of us.<br />
<br />
Why doesn&#039;t He stop bad things? First, I read your questions and they are ones that I have had for so long. I am glad to know I am not the only one. What I am about to give you is simply the conclusion I have come to that has given me peace. This is hard to fathom, but He uses the bad things that happen, a part of the plan. The reason for the pain is sin. That is the simple part. The root of all evil is the initial sin. Bad things happen because we are imperfect. Now, I get angry at God a lot, when I see people suffering, like starving children in Africa, or someone being abused. Why does He allow it? We don&#039;t see the big picture though, it is all a divine plan. The painful experiences He gives us are used later in life. An example of this is a story I once heard about someone who used to cut themselves. Think, God allowed that to happen, allowed the person to be treated so poorly that was their only resort. This person eventually healed, but still why did God allow that much hurt in a life He created and loved? It is because later, that person was able to use that experience to help others struggling with it. Think, if that person had never had that struggle and learned to heal, they would not have been able to help so many other people. So yes, it hurts now, it is not fair, but we don&#039;t see it all. Sometimes we are suppose to hurt because of the way we will be lead to use that story later.<br />
<br />
About the balance thing and God creating people He knows won&#039;t accept Him, I wonder a lot on this. It&#039;s not fair or just. What about people who never hear the word of God? I mean, never ever have contact with someone to share with them. Zero opportunity? Does that get taken into consideration? Do they suffer for eternity? I don&#039;t know. Really, that is a huge question, one I have prayed for an answer to, but somehow I doubt I will know while I am still alive here.<br />
<br />
Obviously I am a Christian. I don&#039;t like the term Christian, because of the name the hypocritical Christians have given it, in fact, I think it is past time to seperate ourselves out from those that are hypocritical and give us all a bad name. I prefer to call myself a follower of Christ. <br />
<br />
Ah, and as for psionics...my family essentially ridicules me, but I deal with it and I believe. The only thing I have gotten them to accept is Reiki, which is kind of different in my mind. I think that we have a lot more power and ability than we know. Unless you are directly summoning the devil, I don&#039;t believe it to be witchcraft. I do believe though that it is our responsibility to be moral about this. That means privacy for others and nons is a must and always having respect for all.</div>

       I bring prosperity and create disaster; <br />

<br />
Makes it seem a bit nicer, yes? but indeed, god (according to christians) did in fact create all evil and things that do evil. therefore not all god, as he claims in other verses.<br />
<br />
About the cause for pain and suffering being sin:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard this one plenty of times, the reason for anything bad is original sin. This means that we are paying for the sin we inherited from Adam and Eve, right? Well in the bible, it states inDeuteronomy 24:16 (King James Version):<br />
<br />
16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.<br />
<br />
in Ezekiel 18:20 (King James Version):<br />
<br />
20The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.<br />
<br />
<br />
How then, should we have to suffer from original sin? since we are not to be punished for their sin, shouldn&#039;t we be unable to sin? The reason Christians say we all sin is because of original sin being inherited, yet they have this verse right in their holy book.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been through about every question imaginable, trying to hold on to the Christian belief i was raised with, because i think its a pretty good way to live, although most don&#039;t live up to the name as some have already stated. But in the end, I had to follow my reasoning and be something else. I became agnostic, because if there&#039;s one thing I learned from my arguments with the bible, it&#039;s that any point can be proven or disproven. New info turns up all the time, and there is no way to find any truth that will last. So I decided religion wasn&#039;t right for me. Life was right for me.<br />
<br />
I came into psionics during my religious expeditions, during the time i was looking into neo-paganism and learning about magic. I was raised to believe such people were satan worshippers, and then I realized how narrow minded this was, seeing as they don&#039;t even believe in his existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there&#039;s a nice sized about me sort of something. I&#039;m willing to answer other questions if you throw them at me. I guess you could say I&#039;m an expert anti-christ.

hre&#039;s another thing to throw on the field =P its another thing that ive thought about, but it hadnt really come to mind earlier... in order to determine what is &quot;good&quot; and what is &quot;evil&quot;, wouldn&#039;t there have to be an absolute to determine that? otherwise we&#039;d all be creating our own standards of good and evil, and there would be mass chaos.<br />
<br />
@Amaroq<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve thought about that too... just a few questions about it though. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I assume that you believe that everyone has an ability or whatever it takes to use an ability? (if im explaining that well enough, writing is not my strong point &gt;.&lt;) Not that this should be used to determine whether religion is true or not, but wouldn&#039;t it be a much better gamble to assume there is an afterlife and a god? <br />

-A person does belive in god, and they die, and get saved. woot.<br />
-A person doesnt beleive in god, finds out there is one, and goes to hell or wherever.<br />
<br />
*shrugs* prehaps we are using our abilities to heal family mamebers and stuff, but when we pray, maybe god is giving us the ability and using it through us to heal? what about when all of the people pray, do whatever they want to possibly release healing energy, and the person goes on a steady decline and dies. would you say there wasnt enough energy or something else?<br />

About Evil in the World and how it got there:

ISAIAH 45:6-7

 6That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.

 7I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all thesethings.

[/quote]

What version of the Bible was that? I only have the NIV. Anyway, I was thinking about it more how something 100-infinity% good could create something bad, and i just couldn&#039;t wrap my head around it until i thought about it another way.. instead of being the choice between good and evil, i thought about it as being the choice between God and separation from God.

in Ezekiel 18:20 (King James Version):

That was a pretty awesome story... it was a wonderful &quot;coincedince&quot; to me. :) My brain doesnt make enough serotonin, so when i get stressed or out of whack in any way, i go through it way too fast. (what makes it worse is that im an empath to some extent, and i can feel auras which are charged with emotion. is that under the branch of empathy or something else?) i while ago i found that cutting made me feel better. i didnt know why exactly, until i was forced to go to something i called the &quot;emo convention&quot; and found out. im not doing it anymore, but i do still have the urge. i still dont get why he didnt seem to be there when i was crying and pleading with him to help me, but what you said def. gave me a bit more hope that i didnt mess myself up for no reason. :)<br />

its pretty interesting..i thought all of this stuff would lead me away from god, but it seems like im actually getting closer to him. ive been moving away from christianity, and now i think ive got my bearings more.<br />

I will not call it coming and going, nor standing still, nor fading away nor beginning. It is without foundation, without continuation, and without stopping. It is the end of suffering.&quot;<br />

Riven, that isn&#039;t just any story, that is my story. Everything happens for a reason and I could give examples, but it would take all day.

Nirvana is actually a grunge rock band. By applying the sentiment of Roland Barthes&#039; Death of the Author, which suggests a writer has no control over the meaning of their word once written such that each work becomes a new moment with every re-reading, we could say that each song is a moment in itself with no single message. Because these moments are only experienced while listening to the sound, the reality that the band has broken up doesn&#039;t matter.. thus the moment nirvana creates is experienced in an infinite number of ways and times, there is still only ever that single moment while listening. (10 points to whoever followed that, I&#039;ll be serious now :P)<br />
<br />
Okay, so I have no idea if this is a correct answer, but I can explain it as I interpret passage. To me its talking about a state without thought; you are not judging, so there does not exist a good or bad, many or one, light or darkness etc. Everything simply IS. Unfortunate things happen, but it doesn&#039;t have to cause you to stumble. If you drop a pebble into water the waves move way, if the pool is large enough you&#039;ll noticed from where you dropped the pebble, it becomes calm again at the center of the waves as they move further away. The enlightened person would be at the center, the person who stumbles is stuck on the wave for a little while. When you are in that state where everything simply IS, there is no future or past, just that infinite now; its always there, your just experiencing it to enjoy the peace found by remaining within it.</div>

Good and Evil are formed by the things people enjoy, and the things that they do not. These things are matured through Experience and Ego. Simply put, Man desires law because without it there is chaos, but the real question is, without ego, can chaos itself even exist? <br />
<br />
Chaos, by definition, is A condition or place of great disorder or confusion. Without the Ego to corrupt people into causing destruction (yes, ego would be the cause of money, at least indirectly) People would have an order. This order is caused by the lack of desire, there would be no desire to lie, no desire for war, no desire even for countries. Once you get past your Ego you begin to understand your true desires. The Desire to live happily and care free. <br />
<br />
Ego was needed to give us purpose, but once you gather experience, you must be able to learn that Ego only causes suffering (yes, I&#039;m saying quite literally that only suffering in life will give someone purpose to live). <br />
<br />
And for what you said to Amoroq, Don&#039;t you think that is, if anything else, the wrong reason to chose to be religious? <br />
