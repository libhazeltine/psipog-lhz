Anyway, f3licks, I&#039;m not really good in explaining things myself (since I don&#039;t understand things perfectly, and I think people should have their own understanding of things, now what I tell them) so I would recommend to read the Initiation into Hermetics, by Franz Bardon. It&#039;s the perfect book for people who want to know more about Magick ;) It shouldn&#039;t be too hard to find an online version.<br />

(I thought there was an article on that on PsiPog.) By constant repetition of a ritual when doing a magickal act, you create a trigger in your subconsciousness so you can do it without being totally focused later. (A short, very bad explanation.) Anyway, I think it&#039;s clear that spells only make sense to the person who makes them, so sites that offer &#039;free spells&#039; and things like that, are a scam. Period.<br />
<br />
There is an exception to this when it comes to rituals like the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and other commonly-used rituals. The reason that these kind of rituals have a good effect upon the Magician who uses them, even though he might not know how they work exactly, is because so many people have used it over the ages, that  it created a &#039;thought matrix&#039; of this ritual in the Mental Sphere. This, however, is a little bit to much to explain completely right now, not because I don&#039;t &#039;know&#039; how it works, but because I would have to explain the complete mechanism of Magick then. (About the spheres, etc.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want to know more about Magick, I refer you to the Initiation into Hermetics, just like I did in my previous post, personally I think it&#039;s the best book for a beginner who wants to have REAL results. I have another link if you just want to know a little bit more about Magick though, this is an Introduction to Magick written by someone from Veritas Society, and I think it offers a great starting point, might you be interested in studying Magick.<br />

		<div id="post_13980" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">My thoughts are similar to Falcon&#039;s. I view &quot;Magick&quot; and &quot;Psionics&quot; as generally the same thing, I assume they&#039;re both a manipulation of energy. As I see it, Magick is a practice that involves using physical items as symbols... a physical manifestation or representation of the idea, belief, or energy. And psionics seems to be more upfront and literal, approuch to manipulating or harnessing the energy. <br />
<br />
For example, say you were trying to win the lottery (since that&#039;s a popular subject here), if you were practicing Magick you may light a certain colored candle or use items that symbolize or &quot;attract&quot; money to you. A practicing Psion might focus on winning the lottery and attempt to change their odds by simply visualizing and focusing on their goal.<br />

I don&#039;t think that was the best example.<br />

		<div id="post_13982" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">In my mind, psionics are an active postive force that works by &quot;causing&#039; the event with a push of your or some other mind. The magick is a negative force of effect that &#039;causes&#039; the effect you desire in a way thats however you want by drawing energy and attention to the effect like use of the elements to cause an event. Some magic, in this case, goes unnoticed because its a choice to acknowledge it and the effect is often not desired. So in truth, psionics is a &#039;push&#039; force that isn&#039;t an infringement on the senses. And magick is a &#039;pull&#039; force that sometimes is.<br />
<br />
However feel free to disagree with me. <br />

Does anyone know any magic spell that has a definite visual effect? Or is that asking too much?</div>Like Falcon said, magic spells don&#039;t have the power on their own but your intention makes them effective. Likewise you can use anything as a replacement for wand bla bla bla.<br />
<br />
My spells were amazingly effective, both visual (sight-based) and physical.<br />
My first spell directly caused my lightbulb to explode in 30 seconds as a sign of manifestation xD And 5 minutes passed, I returned my room and found out that the money I wanted was on the table, given by my flatmate. Also my whole body was full of vibrations. <br />
The second was at the same day. I did a luck spell and suddenly there was an invisible guy in my room, walking around.<br />
I was like &#039;wtf did you guys made me smoke&#039; (i wasn&#039;t believing in magic totally those days xP)and my body was full of vibrations again. My crown chackra was about to explode etc etc. Anyway, I just decided to send away that guy; I didn&#039;t want to have a help from someone else bla bla. Minutes passed, I started to wash the dishes, that guy was walking around me in kitchen, somehow touching me and making me &#039;lucky?&#039;. Anyway, the dish crushed into two pieces when I was cleaning it softly and it cut both of my wrists.<br />
I&#039;m not fond of &#039;fate-bringer&#039; spellcastings because they involve some other help from an unknown force. But psionics are perfectly natural.</div>

<br />
<em>&quot;Sorcery has been called Magic: but Magic is Wisdom, and there is no wisdom in Sorcery.&quot; </em><br />
<br />
Plain &#039;sorcery&#039;, or fulfilling your desires on earth using psychic skills, is NOT Magick, that&#039;s the difference. Magick is a spiritual path, though it has lost it&#039;s former glory since the New Age movement, the Wiccans and the Pagans call every psychic act they do Magick.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we still don&#039;t know what form of Magick we&#039;re talking about here. Are we talking about &#039;real&#039; Magick, As it was supposed to be? Or are we talking about the parlor tricks, called Magick nowadays?<br />

What makes an ordinary man a sorcerer is the movement of assamblage point. Because when we &#039;stop&#039; the world and when we realize there are seperated realties and there&#039;s a way of power manipulation, we become sorcerers. <br />

I got this idea of mine from observation as to hat real magick accomplishes, taking into mind what the parlor tricks does as well. I concluded it calls attention ato the idea that you &#039;realize&#039; was there. Where I noticed you have to apply force in psionics to get an effect. Thus it was magic is a negative and psionics is a positive. <br />

I didn&#039;t speak of sorcery however. Or psionic magic either. Now I realize what the difference is I might use sorcery more often and some of your magick.</div>
