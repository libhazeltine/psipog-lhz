		<div id="post_8216" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hmmm, seeing this technology really gives me an ominous feeling. Theres something about it; I feel like I should be saying, &quot;Wow, how cool!&quot; but I don&#039;t really know... Theres just some precognitive feeling, and when I get these feelings they usually are right. <br />
<br />
This actually reminds me of something that my friend said a couple weeks ago. He said that one day its the &quot;psychic people&quot; that will save the world, and seeing this technology it really makes me think theres a possibility of that being the outcome. Seriously, if they can tune into brainwaves one day they could possibly control peoples thoughts and reflexes. I feel that this is where shielding will come in handy, as many people will be transformed into minions of &quot;the man&quot;; those who can shield well won&#039;t be effected and will have to either save everyone or do nothing as the world is controlled by a few evil people. It would be interesting to see someone skilled try to block it with a shield. I&#039;m sure they would have success.<br />

*Edit:<br />
<br />
Heh, watch it be cancer-causing... If cell phones can cause brain cancer, I wonder what this will do (especially with the way things are going nowadays lol)*<br />

Oh, and Wandering Wolf, we will be special, because we don&#039;t need that machinery to function. and plus, its all virtual right now, I don&#039;t think that kind of that technology that can effect real life objects will be coming out too soon. Macro-PK FTW!!!</div>

I think you are right: Shielding probably will be paramount for anyone who wishes to hold onto his or her free will (and privacy). I don&#039;t like this at all. I hope I die before the technology gets to the telepathic and/or telepathic suggestion level. We humans are too ambitious for our own good. We just want to keep moving foward and making new breakthroughs in technology instead of being satisfied with what we have. They are already taking a whack at the locks of Pandora&#039;s box and it&#039;s only going to be a matter of time before they get it open.<br />
<br />
If there is going to be an apocalypse (not 2012: That&#039;s supposedly just a new era of potential spiritual growth via higher vibrations from what I hear) it is probably going to stem from technology like this.<br />

All they&#039;d need to do is find out what kind of energy is used to move objects and create a machine to pick up on that energy and utilize it, assuming that an energy is even used in the first place. Perhaps Macro-PK is only possible through a live consciousness, in which case you would be right, of course. I don&#039;t have the answers, but we sure as hell will find out if they do pretty soon.

Rich families would be able to have super psionic/psychic children genetically engineered or people coud simply have themselves improved in that area with some kind of treatment. Ring any bells?

Aha! So you admit it! Humans are overly-corruptable beings. It sounds just like something that the goverment would give almost anything to be able to do. Their greed and selfishness are insatiable. The bastards.

I didn&#039;t think that everyone could be so serious (especially Dash) and yeah the government conspiracies and predictions of doom sorta freaked me out. I mean what are you supposed to say when someone says, &quot;if they can tune into brainwaves one day they could possibly control peoples thoughts and reflexes.&quot; That&#039;s why I totally drew a blank, but I felt like I should say something especially since I&#039;ve been away for sooooo long and I know everyone missed me -_^</div>
