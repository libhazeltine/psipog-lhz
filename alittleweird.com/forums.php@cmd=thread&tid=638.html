This would most likely lead to a headache. :)<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you have the energy go away from your body, and then come back towards you like a boomerang. If you feel the energy then that means it has passed through the shield.<br />

However, this is only a way to prove that energy can bounce off your shield, not telepathic or empathic messages. Those you would have to test with someone else who knows telepathy/empathy. Any problems you do have should only be programming errors.</div>

Just do what Trick says. Keep your mind cleared and try not be overly emotional and remember your mood. If you find something out of place and you do not know why (Up to a point where you think you don&#039;t know emotions and you&#039;re ready pull your hair out because you think you&#039;ve gone hair wire) it is probably somebody else&#039;s emotions. My advice after this happens, find out who is feeling what you are feeling. The person shouldn&#039;t be that hard to find. Their actions and expressions should stand out from other (at least that&#039;s how it was for me).</div>

Just do what Trick says. Keep your mind cleared and try not be overly emotional and remember your mood. If you find something out of place and you do not know why (Up to a point where you think you don&#039;t know emotions and you&#039;re ready pull your hair out because you think you&#039;ve gone hair wire) it is probably somebody else&#039;s emotions. My advice after this happens, find out who is feeling what you are feeling. The person shouldn&#039;t be that hard to find. Their actions and expressions should stand out from other (at least that&#039;s how it was for me).</div>Thanks a lot!<br />
I&#039;ve been working on reading people, and I think I&#039;m getting results, but I&#039;m pretty skeptical. It took me a long time just to acknowledge that psiballs were real.</div>

Ok. But its psionic empathy he&#039;s trying to learn here. Not normal empathy. Empathy really isnt that hard, its happened to me for a while without realizing. Basically, always be aware of what your thinking. Throughout the day, know what your feeling. Eventually, when you go by other people youll start feeling things, and youll know its not yours. Just always be aware of what your feeling, and when you feel somebody elses emotion, it will stick out. This is actually something somebody taught me for telepathy, but thier mostly the same, and I&#039;ve been picking up peoples emotions for a while now.[/quote]

That is true. He is trying to learn psionic empathy. I forgot the difference for a second there.
