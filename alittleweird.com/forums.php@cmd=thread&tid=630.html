I wouldn&#039;t practice something like that, that you have never tried before while you are freezing to death. Even though the Heat shield could help you warm up, you don&#039;t have enough practice to get it working properly. You will use too much energy and not have enough to heat your body.<br />

I would suggest practicing in a cold room, one that does have a heater, but make sure the heater is off. This will help you concentrate more, without the risk of passing out in zero degree weather.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, I do something similar from time to time, but less complicated. If my hands are a little cold, I&#039;ll fill them and surround them with energy, which I&#039;ll program to be warm, and have it follow my hands. Not very effective, but it does have a certain novelty to it, plus it does give me a chance to practice making warm psi-balls. When I&#039;m actually having trouble with cold weather though, and find my coat isn&#039;t enough, I&#039;ll clear my mind, blot the cold sensation out of wherever it&#039;s hitting me, and then completely ignore the fact that it&#039;s 10 degrees outside (&quot;there is no wind, there is no cold...&quot;). As long as I can maintain my concentration, it&#039;s incredibly effective (for me, anyways). Back in college, I used it to get back and forth to class through a foot of snow without a coat, noting that I&#039;m used to the hotter Texan climate rather than cold, wet Missouri, if that tells you anything. Of course, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for extended periods, as it&#039;ll likely lead to frostbite/other coldness-related nastiness, as it&#039;s more of a palliative (getting rid of the feeling of the coldness, rather than actually warming up) than anything else.</div>

If my hands are a little cold, I&#039;ll fill them and surround them with energy, which I&#039;ll program to be warm, and have it follow my hands. Not very effective, but it does have a certain novelty to it, plus it does give me a chance to practice making warm psi-balls. When I&#039;m actually having trouble with cold weather though, and find my coat isn&#039;t enough, I&#039;ll clear my mind, blot the cold sensation out of wherever it&#039;s hitting me, and then completely ignore the fact that it&#039;s 10 degrees outside (&quot;there is no wind, there is no cold...&quot;). As long as I can maintain my concentration, it&#039;s incredibly effective (for me, anyways). Back in college, I used it to get back and forth to class through a foot of snow without a coat, noting that I&#039;m used to the hotter Texan climate rather than cold, wet Missouri, if that tells you anything. Of course, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for extended periods, as it&#039;ll likely lead to frostbite/other coldness-related nastiness, as it&#039;s more of a palliative (getting rid of the feeling of the coldness, rather than actually warming up) than anything else.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Seriously though, I do something similar from time to time, but less complicated.

		<div id="post_12688" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Yesterday I had what I think is a really good idea for heating up. i think a heat bubble would give heat mostly to the outside except you program it to direct the heat at you. My idea are heat disks. You create multiple disks which give heat and arrange them like that:<br />

The heat moves upwards and heatens up your whole body. If you add a bubble that hold the heat inside, then you shouldnt freeze ^^</div>

I don&#039;t understand that at all. If you&#039;re old enough to be on a computer, you&#039;re certainly old enough to learn proper typing. It&#039;s not exactly difficult to write what you want to say in a word processor, use spell check, and paste it back here.<br />

And people shouldn&#039;t have gotten angry over the less-than-polite replies to the kid. He has to learn SOME time. <br />

Ah. I&#039;ll stop now. I&#039;ll be ranting for hours if I continue..<br />

QUESTION. <br />

Does Sean still do the classes for his geiger counter? I notice there&#039;s still the countdown towards the next class, but it still seemed unlikely. <br />
