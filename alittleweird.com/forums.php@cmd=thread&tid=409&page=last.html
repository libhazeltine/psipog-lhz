There is no better proof than proving it to yourself. I have done this with one of my friends. We talked about Psionics in a casual setting. Eventually I asked her to read some arcticles on psipog and try the psiwheel. She didn&#039;t get it at first, but it didn&#039;t take her long. Since then she has become extremely interested in all things paranormal and we have become great chat buddies for stuff like this. I know this may not work for everyone, but in my opinion it&#039;s a good place to start. Don&#039;t try to prove yourself. Your ego will get in the way.</div>

How can you tell when your ability woul be &quot;The most impressive&quot; ? <br />
there will always be some skeptical. Isn&#039;t it make you feel like you want to slap everybody in that room and tell them &quot; Look ! it&#039;s real! *demonstraiting TK* &quot; .<br />
<br />
How can you tell what will make them go &quot; OK.. He&#039;s right and shuttered all laws of physics... now we belive him... &quot;.<br />
<br />
@ Wandering Wolf<br />
well the thing is, I feel much comfortable to do it near friends than family, but still, thier skiptical opinions are worth considering, and even convincing sometimes and that skeptisizm ( and doubt ) hamper TK and other psionics. <br />
<br />
@ JakePsi<br />
Yo , :) . <br />
Well psi-wheel wasn&#039;t my favorite way to demonstrait TK , but I thought of some force wave ( like Henry from LF2 ) on unsespecting victim ( not harming him of course :P  )<br />
Thnaks for the warning, I&#039;ll think wisely ;).<br />
I feel like I&#039;m developing my TK but get hamperd by the situation of I&#039;m the only one who is working in this subject without being able to share it with others, what can be more convincing that live TK ? <br />
<br />
@ Ether<br />
Well I have a friend which I showed her video of me doung psi-ball and the camera went blue-pixels all over. And she got into it too but it&#039;s Tests months , so we can&#039;t meet and share stuffs. Beside that&#039; I don&#039;t trust her much :P LOL.<br />
about your last sentence: I couldn&#039;t agree more, but how can you preform in front of people without some ego? even theaters and mimeing have egos when preforming.<br />
<br />
@ Akio<br />
see my answer about ego on Ether&#039;s answer.<br />
Few days ago I just felt like I was psi-attacking myself, I felt weak, sad and deppressed,. So, I think it really got me ( my ego ) :P . <br />

I agree with Ether, doing it yourself is the only way that cements a belief in it. The only way that I truly came to believe this myself was by doing it, fortunately I picked it up rather quickly or I would have dismissed it as nuts. A lot depends on the person too, if they do not trust you and think that you would pull their leg, well, they probably aren&#039;t going to believe you.<br />
<br />
In other words, we could all talk to the world about this until we are blue in the face, we could show them a hundred times over, and yeah, a few people might believe it, but until we get them to try it, they aren&#039;t going to really believe it.<br />
<br />
And as for the ego thing, you have to have confidence, but not an ego. You must know what you can do, but that doesn&#039;t mean you have pride in it. It should never be a look what I can do thing, but a look what we can do, a sharing of abilities, but never a display.</div>
