Reasons for thinking he is my subconscious:<br />

In any case it&#039;s not too unheard of to hear the voices in your head, subconscious or otherwise as either different genders, or different tones. If you are suggesting that simply by the sound of the voice that it is male, you could be deceiving yourself on what male/female are. However, if it&#039;s something you FEEL as male then you may be more on the spot. This does not require an explanation from you, just reflection.<br />
<br />
Many people overlook the voice in their head when it tells them to do something, remember something, or pay attention to certain things. Especially when it gives them predictions of the future. You either consciously reinforced it speaking, so you&#039;d hear it more often, or got lucky with it :). <br />
<br />
If your subconscious can beat you in an argument, then you can beat yourself. You both know the same thing. Try and tap into that knowledge, or that logic; if it&#039;s logic that it takes to beat your arguments.</div>

Schitzophrenia (ignore typoError) manifests itself always as a male voice. Reason for this is a coffee table discussion for neurologists.

By confronting did he mean just talking to or getting rid of? And uniting the two halves meaning being comftrable with both the male and female aspects of a personality, or something else?<br />

rofl demon huh? nah...we both seem to believe in God, and he has a high opinion of him. He also hates it and scolds me when I cuss or think seriously about punching someone in the face... *sigh* oh well. I have good self control.<br />

I thought about it more :) What if my sub-c was my animus, or more likely, my sub-c was routed through my animus to give it a personality and voice, which I can much more easily understand? Or it still could be just my sub-c...</div>

While held responsible for negative thoughts they aren&#039;t evil in the larger picture. They need us to experience themselves just as we need them to experience the full range of human emotion. There are also medicine, guardian, plant and animal spirits that can aid and guide a person. The negative spirits if they help you in someway usually have a drawback in someway, where the others will ask nothing or request you stop negative actions/habits. For example the medicine spirits will stop aiding shaman if the shaman should abuse or misuse the power granted, or kill another being even when attacked viciously.<br />
<br />
In that sense it doesn&#039;t seem out of the question that it could be what they consider to be a guardian spirit.

It matches very well to him but I&#039;ve asked him before and he insists he&#039;s a part of me, I&#039;ve asked him which part and to that he&#039;s rather ambiguous, which is one of the reasons I made this thread in the first place.<br />
<br />
He has asked me to not do certain things, and doesn&#039;t talk to me as much if I do decide to do them, but he says he&#039;s &quot;A guide, the desicions are [mine], and as negative as they can sometimes be, [he] won&#039;t interfere.&quot; (The actual quote was a bit longer, he talks like an old english person sometimes :/ )<br />
<br />
Yes actually, once.<br />
<br />
My friend and I were talking and she was telling me about a guy named David. She said he was a spirit and he was really mean. (I think the whole topic came up when I asked her how she got all scratched up.) She said that he mocked her and her friends, put her down, and stuff like that. She&#039;d go to bed and wake up with a bunch of bruises and/or scratches. Anyways, we (I?) both thought that that wasn&#039;t good at all, and he needed to go. They had sort of developed this pretty twisted relationship, like he hurt her and stuff, but then he also protected her and gave her strength, which she felt like she needed and was scared about what would happen if he left. After talking about it for a few days (Some my own thoughts, other times more like a mouthpiece for my other voice), David left. There was an instant personality switch, and not just for that day, either. She was a <em>lot</em> more happy.<br />
<br />
The day after the day after the day David left (sorry), I asked her if anyone came to replace David, and she said that yes, someone had. His name was Dante, and in conversing with him through her, he seemed like a pretty good guy. Protective, but still calm and playful.<br />
<br />
If you think they&#039;re friends, I don&#039;t think so cause they only sorta kinda get along with each other.<br />
<br />
Why do you ask?<br />

If you want me to clarify anything I don&#039;t mind, I just have to get ready for work so I cant really chat much now.</div>

As far as the Anima/Animus thing goes, my book wasn&#039;t really helpful.
