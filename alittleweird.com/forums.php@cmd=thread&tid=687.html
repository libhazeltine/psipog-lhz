		<div id="post_13172" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I&#039;ve recently figured out a few songs that I thought I would never be able to play. Yet here I am, a 12  year old kid, who can now play songs from Jake Shimabukuro. O.o It started out one night when I wasn&#039;t able to sleep. I thought I would do something like mess around with my Rubix Cube, when I decided to play my &#039;Ukulele (an instrument with four strings. Kinda like a small guitar) Anyway, I grabbed my iPod and started listening to Jake play some songs from his &#039;Gently Weeps&#039; CD. I just so happened to play the same chords he played.....WTF?! How is this possible? Am I some kind of musical genius or what? I never, ever, EVER could figure out anything he played, yet I can now do the impossible.  Sheesh, I wouldn&#039;t be surprized if I could fly.....well...that&#039;s an overstatement but still....I never thought I could play it....,When I was online one day, a long time ago, I read on a supernatural site that &quot;Sometimes, when people have sudden urges to do things, and they succeed at perfecting it, it means that they have been visited by someone or something that was talented in this region.&quot; HOW THE HELL DID I LEARN IT?!Oh and I haven&#039;t played in like, three months.</div>

		<div id="post_13177" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I don&#039;t know about the supernatural part. It could be true. But as far as being able to play like that, it is possible to acheive something like that in probably any conceivable skill. Since you seem to have had some prior experince with playing the Ukulele, and maybe also have memories of watching other more skilled users preform, and if you did watch someone preform, then you probably have very detailed memories stored of that event, whether you can recall them or not. So using those memories you were able to do the &#039;monkey see monkey do&#039; trick of imitation, but at a much higher level.<br />
<br />
But due to the way the archaic educational system works, we lose a lot of access to those inner resources. So therefore something like learning an instrument which should only take a matter of weeks or months, possibliy even days, with access to those resources, where as without access, takes years. Now imagine a piece of black paper with a hole the size of a pin in it, now shine a flashlight on the hole and imagine how much light is coming through. Now take another piece of black paper with a hole in it the size of a 3 inch hole and shine a flashlight on it. The point of the exercise? The pin hole is the amount of information that can get through on the educational system, the 3 inch hole would be the amount of information that can get through if we had more access to those inner resources. And of course the light from the flashlight representing information. I am not trying to say the educational system is bad, but there is a lot of research it could take advantage of that would bring it up to where it needs to be for the 21st Century, instead of being geared towards the late 19th to early 20th Century like it is now. At least in America.<br />
<br />
Any how, it is interesting to see something like that pop-up. It is possible for anyone on the forum to do that. I do have some information on the subject if anyone is interested.</div>

It sounds like you have listened to his music a lot. Having a musical ear allows you to replicate any note you may hear. You may have unconciously been working out how to play what you&#039;ve been hearing, and that day you just happened to have a breakthrough.<br />

		<div id="post_13183" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I agree with Subliminal; it was probably your subconscious practicing the songs as your conscious busied itself with other things. Its happened to me before. So far, it is the only way that I have been able to get results with psychokinesis (and only once at that).<br />
<br />
This is also like something I have seen in a number of books on writing. The process usually consists of some form of brainstorming, leaving the work for a while, and coming back to see what ideas you have. The point is to let the subconscious organize and collect what you already know then deliver it to the conscious in a ready to use form.<br />
<br />
Whether this should be considered &quot;supernatural&quot;, &quot;paranormal&quot;, or &quot;natural,&quot; is to be decided by one&#039;s own definitions of each. Personally, I think that many normal things that happen in our lives but that we never notice are, in fact, the very things that we seek as psychic and paranormal; we just never slow down, listen, feel, and realize that it&#039;s all around us.</div>

I don&#039;t know about the supernatural part. It could be true. But as far as being able to play like that, it is possible to acheive something like that in probably any conceivable skill. Since you seem to have had some prior experince with playing the Ukulele, and maybe also have memories of watching other more skilled users preform, and if you did watch someone preform, then you probably have very detailed memories stored of that event, whether you can recall them or not. So using those memories you were able to do the &#039;monkey see monkey do&#039; trick of imitation, but at a much higher level.<br />
<br />
But due to the way the archaic educational system works, we lose a lot of access to those inner resources. So therefore something like learning an instrument which should only take a matter of weeks or months, possibliy even days, with access to those resources, where as without access, takes years. Now imagine a piece of black paper with a hole the size of a pin in it, now shine a flashlight on the hole and imagine how much light is coming through. Now take another piece of black paper with a hole in it the size of a 3 inch hole and shine a flashlight on it. The point of the exercise? The pin hole is the amount of information that can get through on the educational system, the 3 inch hole would be the amount of information that can get through if we had more access to those inner resources. And of course the light from the flashlight representing information. I am not trying to say the educational system is bad, but there is a lot of research it could take advantage of that would bring it up to where it needs to be for the 21st Century, instead of being geared towards the late 19th to early 20th Century like it is now. At least in America.<br />

He has access to more information, more people of different beliefs, and has the capability of choosing what he believes.

I don&#039;t really believe that&#039;s anything supernatural.

It sounds like you have listened to his music a lot. Having a musical ear allows you to replicate any note you may hear. You may have unconciously been working out how to play what you&#039;ve been hearing, and that day you just happened to have a breakthrough.

I&#039;ve recently figured out a few songs that I thought I would never be able to play. Yet here I am, a 12  year old kid, who can now play songs from Jake Shimabukuro. O.o It started out one night when I wasn&#039;t able to sleep. I thought I would do something like mess around with my Rubix Cube, when I decided to play my &#039;Ukulele (an instrument with four strings. Kinda like a small guitar) Anyway, I grabbed my iPod and started listening to Jake play some songs from his &#039;Gently Weeps&#039; CD. I just so happened to play the same chords he played.....WTF?! How is this possible? Am I some kind of musical genius or what? I never, ever, EVER could figure out anything he played, yet I can now do the impossible.  Sheesh, I wouldn&#039;t be surprized if I could fly.....well...that&#039;s an overstatement but still....I never thought I could play it....,When I was online one day, a long time ago, I read on a supernatural site that &quot;Sometimes, when people have sudden urges to do things, and they succeed at perfecting it, it means that they have been visited by someone or something that was talented in this region.&quot; HOW THE HELL DID I LEARN IT?!Oh and I haven&#039;t played in like, three months.</div></div>
