Its hard to be objective about your beliefs; Alan Watts suggested that in order to do so he decided to learn about eastern culture and thought, but I don&#039;t know that it would actually grant you an objective place to view your old ones from.

open to interpretation, a part of it surely is.<br />
<br />
Also looking at the time frame of the Bible, it says for example that women shouldn&#039;t &#039;teach&#039; anything.<br />
In their time this would be extremely normal, but this has changed in our time, so there are things that have been changed lately.<br />
<br />
About Jusseppe, I don&#039;t think parts of the Bible were manipulated for social control, I&#039;d believe that it depends on how you look at it.<br />
And the Bible isn&#039;t written by God himself of course, but that doesn&#039;t mean it shouldn&#039;t be very important to me.<br />
I&#039;m sure a lot of people arround here have other beliefs than me, but please just accept that I&#039;m a Christian and that the Bible is very important to me ;)<br />
<br />
To be a little on topic, renting a room isn&#039;t really necessary, a quiet place will do.<br />
But if you don&#039;t know a quiet place, okay, then it might be the best option ;)<br />
Also, this depends on the ammount of money you can spend O.o<br />

First of all I&#039;m sorry about my previous post, I remember comming across information that suggested at some points in history people with power used religion (not specificaly the Bible) for political purposes. However, it was irresponsible making such a statement without having that information to back it up, I can see how that might upset some people.<br />
<br />
What I really meant was: when reading the Bible (in my opinion) you should always think about the context in which it was written, because there are things in the Bible that are in there for reasons that wouldn&#039;t apply to our times.<br />
<br />
Damn, I hope I was clear enough, I always have a hard time putting my thoughts into words (besides, I&#039;m not from an English speaking country, so that makes it harder).</div>

I feel that in the puusuit of knowledge, one must never shut something out because of their beliefs alone, but rather adapt their perspactive according to the knowledge they aquire. Search for the Higher answer, if you know what I mean ^_-.<br />
<br />
I also think that the thing you mentioned about the rituals being to increase their natural abilities is pretty spot on too, considering my study of magicks as a whole (a study that has lasted a good 6 years of my life and has spanned information from all over the world). There is also proof that the Bible changes as it is transcribed, adapted, so to speak. lol, I find it amazing how easily religeon can be corrupted, although I won&#039;t get into that unless asked.<br />

<br />
Falcon, I am a Christian psion too! I tried telling my brother about psionics, but he has his worries just like you do that it is some sort of magic. I voiced my brother&#039;s concerns to my psionic friend, who happens to be a Wiccan, and he replied telling me that in the Hebrew edition of the Bible the literally translated verses mention nothing about sorcerors. Instead it mentions to beware of &quot;poisoners&quot;. I personally don&#039;t know why they used the term &quot;poisoner&quot;, but I think it could be refering to traitors in general.<br />
<br />
When the Bible was first translated into English &quot;poisoner&quot; could have been misinterpreted as &quot;sorceror&quot; or &quot;witch&quot;, because both sorcerors and witches used poison in the popular fiction of the Middle Ages.<br />

Anyways let us get back on topic with Zorro&#039;s dilema and not derail this thread, because of religion.</div>

Instead it mentions to beware of &quot;poisoners&quot;. I personally don&#039;t know why they used the term &quot;poisoner&quot;, but I think it could be refering to traitors in general.

When the Bible was first translated into English &quot;poisoner&quot; could have been misinterpreted as &quot;sorceror&quot; or &quot;witch&quot;, because both sorcerors and witches used poison in the popular fiction of the Middle Ages.

Anyways let us get back on topic with Zorro&#039;s dilema and not derail this thread, because of religion.</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

<br />
Translations, Historical Perspective, Miscommunication - plenty of elements lend to the muddling of modern perspective. Though I would argue that, yes, Psionics probably could be considered tainted work in biblical terms. I have little doubt I could find someone who&#039;d argue for that position, though I personally don&#039;t agree with the stance.<br />

For Zorro: Also the psi wheel isn&#039;t the only mode of TK practice, you two could go to a restaurant, leave a coin or two on the table and try to knock its edge up. Or go to a library and practice rolling a pencil. Going to a park with a psiwheel isn&#039;t out of the question but you&#039;d probably want to take a glass bowl to lay over the top so wind doesn&#039;t have as much chance of effect. Still a slight issue because of the space between planks in a picnic table.</div>

		<div id="post_9291" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Thanks NewAge, the coin idea is something that kind of slipped my mind. My friend tried to get me to do the same thing with a book at the bookstore, well, funny how if you don&#039;t think you can do something it becomes rather difficult to do it...needless to say, I reached out and bumped it over with my hand...hey, he didn&#039;t specify how to knock it over ;)<br />
<br />
And Waldo, I love what you did! I can&#039;t believe that they wouldn&#039;t notice, I will try that sometime.<br />
<br />
Psikillion, yes we go to the same school, we are on summer vacation right now, but they tend to be uptight about kids in the hallways when they aren&#039;t suppose to be, otherwise that is a good idea too.</div>
