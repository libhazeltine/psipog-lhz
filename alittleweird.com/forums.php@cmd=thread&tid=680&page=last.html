 <br />
You have a desire for association with people and, since you have no difficulty in being spontaneous and expressive with others, you have considerable ability for discussion and debate.<br />
 <br />
You enjoy unexpected opportunities for meeting people, or doing things on the spur of the moment.<br />
 <br />
Where you have difficulty is in organizing and systematizing the handling of your responsibilities.<br />
 <br />
Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.<br />

it actually had a thing for deli (it&#039;s a nickname, but i felt like going with it)<br />
btw, i tried deli with both genders, (don&#039;t ask) and it&#039;s the same for each one <br />
<br />
1. yea, i&#039;d say that is true. <br />
2. mixed feelings...<br />
i do have some desire for association with people, but i do have difficulty with being spontaneous and expressive. i&#039;ve really good thoughts with discussions and debate, but lack the communication skills to get these thoughts across clearly &gt;.&gt;<br />
3. mayhaps this is my aspergers speaking, but unexpected and spur of the moment scares me, so no.<br />
4. also, no.<br />
5. eh, pretty true. i work well with what has my interest, but grow bored fast.<br />
6. not sure what to say here &gt;.&gt;<br />
7. i&#039;m not really sure what it&#039;s trying to say by &quot;scattered and emotional nature.&quot;, but my active mind and urge to explore ideas is in no way frustrating. i rely on it to get through my boring life &gt;.&gt;<br />

		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_13385">Your first name of Deli has given you a quick, active mind, which has caused you to delve into many different ideas and theories.
 
You have a desire for association with people and, since you have no difficulty in being spontaneous and expressive with others, you have considerable ability for discussion and debate.
 
You enjoy unexpected opportunities for meeting people, or doing things on the spur of the moment.
 
Where you have difficulty is in organizing and systematizing the handling of your responsibilities.
 
Though you can work on any undertaking intently as long as it absorbs your interest, you cannot persevere when confronted by obstacles or by tedious monotony.
 
Thus your success in your undertakings is limited.
Although the name Deli creates an active mind and a restless urge to explore new ideas, we emphasize that it frustrates you through a scattered and emotional nature.
 
This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the solar plexus, liver and bloodstream.



O.o
it actually had a thing for deli (it&#039;s a nickname, but i felt like going with it)
btw, i tried deli with both genders, (don&#039;t ask) and it&#039;s the same for each one 

1. yea, i&#039;d say that is true. 
2. mixed feelings...
i do have some desire for association with people, but i do have difficulty with being spontaneous and expressive. i&#039;ve really good thoughts with discussions and debate, but lack the communication skills to get these thoughts across clearly &gt;.&gt;
3. mayhaps this is my aspergers speaking, but unexpected and spur of the moment scares me, so no.
4. also, no.
5. eh, pretty true. i work well with what has my interest, but grow bored fast.
6. not sure what to say here &gt;.&gt;
