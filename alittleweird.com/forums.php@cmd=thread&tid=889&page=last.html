		<div id="post_16064" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hello friends, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s already a post about Karma, I just didn&#039;t want to look :P<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve recently come upon the theory, for those who believe in Karma, promoting the &quot;thoughts create one&#039;s reality&quot; hypothesis.  <br />
<br />
First, karma is looked at in different ways by the way.  Basically it is the concept that the consequences of one&#039;s actions will return to them somehow.  Some say that karma effects one&#039;s position in their next life, some say that there&#039;s immediate karma that will return the consequences of one&#039;s actions to you their current life, and some go on to say the same, except the consequences will have increased by a tenfold (relaying it somewhat to a &quot;snowball&quot; effect).  Those are just a few of the various outlooks on karma.  <br />
<br />
A way in which it could philosophically support the idea of &quot;thoughts creating one&#039;s reality&quot; is as follows:<br />
Whenever someone hits another person with their car, they receive different karma depending on if they did it with or without intent, right? If someone maliciously ran someone down, they&#039;ll receive pretty bad karma later on for it.  If someone accidentally hit someone, depending on the situation, they will receive a different kind of karma.  The only difference in the aforementioned situations is what the person&#039;s intent or <strong>thoughts</strong> were.  Their karma will affect or <strong>create</strong> a situation in <strong>their reality</strong> (or in some cases, their next reality) <strong>depending on what they thought</strong> when they hit that person.  <br />
<br />
What do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
- I&#039;m unclear if &quot;cognitive reality&quot; is the appropriate term for this, so if it isn&#039;t please let me know! Thanks!<br />
- I found this off another website which I have been having the hardest time in the world finding again to source, so if you know where this theory came from, please do post! Thanks!</div>

I was riding my bike and was trying to estimate what karmic debt I might have tallied up by, for example,  unintentionally running over bugs with my bike. The result: the bike came to an instant halt, and I flew over the handlebars. I made a promise to myself, as I was tending to my bleeding elbows and kneecaps, to never worry about this topic again. I never got as far as to consider intentionality, though. I was a nice kid.<br />
<br />
My opinions: I don&#039;t think anyone is ever punished by an external force. Who would give a damn? I mean, really? That would be the most extreme form of micro-management. Karma is religous propaganda for population control or wishful thinking (hope that bastard gets it in the end). </div>

(I&#039;m not criticizing your statement, I just want to know more)</div>Yeah when I posted it I thought it might not be phrased right hehe... What I meant is this: The idea of living beings inhabiting our world actually bending reality (Which is what we do here, let&#039;s face it)... Doesn&#039;t that sound a little more credible than saying forces from outside the universe are bending it and wasting their time punishing us little insects, specks of dust in the infinitely large cosmos? I didn&#039;t mean karma was more credible than the &quot;My god will punish you.&quot;, they&#039;re pretty much the same concept. I meant us and our sense of guilt being the actual cause of karmic reactions or whatever you want to call them to make more sense... An immortal being wouldn&#039;t care about us humans; even those who research medical ways to achieve immortality say this: an immortal being would end up with no feelings, needs or drive, as they&#039;d keep delaying their activities, having all the time in the world. They would feel no need to act, as all that keeps us going and reaching for new things is the fact that we&#039;ll die one day and must do it before that time. In other words, an immortal being or anything of the sort with no ultimate deadline to act and punish mortals would just not pay attention to them and let them be. (All according to various philosophers and all, of course. For some reason I haven&#039;t gotten around to talking to an immortal yet... ;P) Any better? :P<br />
<br />
But like you said, that&#039;s pretty much religious debate...</div>

Yeah when I posted it I thought it might not be phrased right hehe... What I meant is this: The idea of living beings inhabiting our world actually bending reality (Which is what we do here, let&#039;s face it)... Doesn&#039;t that sound a little more credible than saying forces from outside the universe are bending it and wasting their time punishing us little insects, specks of dust in the infinitely large cosmos? I didn&#039;t mean karma was more credible than the &quot;My god will punish you.&quot;, they&#039;re pretty much the same concept. I meant us and our sense of guilt being the actual cause of karmic reactions or whatever you want to call them to make more sense... An immortal being wouldn&#039;t care about us humans; even those who research medical ways to achieve immortality say this: an immortal being would end up with no feelings, needs or drive, as they&#039;d keep delaying their activities, having all the time in the world. They would feel no need to act, as all that keeps us going and reaching for new things is the fact that we&#039;ll die one day and must do it before that time. In other words, an immortal being or anything of the sort with no ultimate deadline to act and punish mortals would just not pay attention to them and let them be. (All according to various philosophers and all, of course. For some reason I haven&#039;t gotten around to talking to an immortal yet... ;P) Any better? :P

But like you said, that&#039;s pretty much religious debate...</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

Ok, I give up, I&#039;m going to comment on it.<br />
<br />
@Kube<br />
Although I do believe in a higher power, I agree with you. Us actually bending the reality of our world is a lot more believable than &quot;My god will punish you.&quot; I hate the fact that people threaten other people with &quot;their&quot; god, expecting that if your loyal enough that your god will love you better than them. (I could be over analyzing this.)<br />
<br />
So karma is a lot more creditable and higher powers punishing us. Although I don&#039;t really believe in karma, I do believe people get what they deserve.<br />
<br />
(Actually, I believe people put too much thought or faith into karma.)<br />
<br />
Now, about that immortal being not caring. I disagree, I do believe he cares and loves us.<br />
<br />
But, we should really not get into a debate over this....<br />

In some way, your subconscious registers what happened and makes your reality different depending on how bad you feel about it, and your beliefs.

<br />
However, after finding out that I was the cause, one day I discovered that anything I had labeled as &quot;bad luck&quot;, was actually the opposite. That&#039;s because this &quot;bad luck&quot; occurred when I was trying to force myself to do something that actually wasn&#039;t for me and I couldn&#039;t even realize it before. Both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; luck like guide you in the journey of finding yourself.<br />
<br />
So, in theory you could live always having good luck if you think you are worth it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: There&#039;s probably a catch to this whole Karma thing - the subconsciousness captures other peoples&#039; thoughts and feelings about you. So, it&#039;s probably possible to &quot;punish&quot; someone, but I think that with a strong will and self-confidence, one could be able to resist it.</div>
