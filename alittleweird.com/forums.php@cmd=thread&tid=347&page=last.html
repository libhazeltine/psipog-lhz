When I come to think of it, There is no barrier, our Concience creates a barrier as a necessity to progress in the material world that we as a society have created for ourselves. It&#039;s the same base many would say religeon spawns from, well, rather to break this barrier we have created for ourselves in order to obtain true enlightenment. I am not saying that I am enlightened, but rather that this is my experience. It is the knoledge that we our ignorant that leads us to true enlightenment.<br />

Actually I couldn&#039;t really think strait until I put myself out of my ego(which is a very weird ego indeed) Even if I was only thinking to myself, talking to someone else or even trying to convince myself of something. (I so weird, I can&#039;t even tell when I lie to myself.<br />
