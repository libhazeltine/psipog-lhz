		<div id="post_7263" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">I know many people have had exeriences with ghosts (includng myself) and several other supernatural entities so I wanna hear them. Now my experiences are not limited to simpy seeing someone standing in my bedroom or hearing people calling my name though I have experienced both, I have seen things that do not take a human form and have &quot;literally&quot; scared the piss out of me at an early age. Since I haven&#039;t yet posted one of my own experiences I will do so: <br />
<br />
One night (when I was five) I was deep in sleep and had a dream about some hand coming under my covers to grab me. In my dream I touched the hand and then was jolted awake from the dream. Suddenly the power in my house go out, I knew this because I got up and my fan was just turned off as the turbines were slowing to a stop (I also had a nightlight plugged in). I look over to the center of my room and there are three pitch black figures with no discernable faces or limbs standing around my bed, as soon as I notice them they dissapate into thin air. This was then followed by me running into the livingroom to sleep on the couch.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that I was on no medication at the time and had lived up to that point a very healthy family oriented lifestyle with no violence and trauma. :p Actually the only traumatizing events I have experienced in my life have been caused by supernatural entities and I now have re-occuring nightmares thanks to them.</div>

It is extremely difficult to be able to test anything with children these days. More paranormal the concept, less co-operation from the parents.<br />

		<div id="post_7288" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">´K, so here are some of the supernatural things i´ve seen, and I hope to know your comments and opinions.<br />
<br />
- Here in Monterrey, Mexico, at the heart of the city, lies this huge dry river crossing east to west. When I was about 14, whe crossed one of the bridges above it to get to the main avenue. I thought I saw, for a very brief moment, a 10 year old boy with darh hair and dressed in a shimmering white cotton shirt and trousers, standing between some bushes aside the river. Even though it was about 2 seconds, the image was very clear in my mind. I asked my mom if a tragedy happened close to that same date in the past, and she told me it was around that time that the Gilbert hurricane hit the city, taking a lot of people from the neighborhoods around. She said it was before I was born, and that it should be on TV (I really didn´t know, since I was just off school that moment)<br />
<br />
- This one happened when I was younger, about 12 (sorry for the time shifts :P) My parents, older brother and me were passing along a big, woody park on our way home, at it was about 5:30, when I saw these weird, dark smoke tornadoes swirling over each tree. They were about 5 or 6 feet tall, and as the sun got lower, they got easier to see. This lasted about 12 minutes, and yet, I was the only one seeing them. My parents and my brother didn´t see anything, and they jokingly said I was bonkers (no meds taken btw, and way before knowing anything about psionics or clarivoyance), What was even more weird was seeing one again last year, and a friend of mine could see them too. She even confessed to me seeing ones around her house around the same date and hour I did.<br />
-Finally, the most recent one (I see stuff like this quite often, but nothing as spooky as this one). One year ago, I was reading the Tarot quite well, so an aunt of mine asked me to do a reading on a cousin of mine, who happened to be a bullfighter (no cliché here, we really DO have a bull arena back here in my hometown Cadereyta, about an hour east from the city) As I followed the reading, there was a very dense feeling coming from a mirror in the living room. The cards said he would not do so well in that weeks bullfighting event, due to stress, and that it would be the last time he would bullfight. That was said, no more, no less. Back at home, I told my dad about the thing in the mirror. I saw a shadow take the shape of a late uncle, who happened to be my cousin´s dad, and yet I knew it wasn´t my uncle to begin with, but more of an omen. A bad one.<br />
One week later, I came back from college and my brother was at ome. He told me my cousin had died in a car accident. At the wake, m aunt asked me for ways to communicate with my dead cousin, thinking I knew any method by the event of my prediction coming true.<br />
<br />
I have to stress a lot in the fact that I´m NOT B&amp;LLSH@TT1N6 at all, and I´m not doing this as an attention whore. I really do want to discuss this stuff on analitical grounds.<br />
<br />
I hope to see your posts :D</div>

		<div id="post_7298" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Mmm, there&#039;s only one thing sort of &quot;paranormal&quot;, but it&#039;s not related to ghosts or anything...when I was about six years old, I had an OBE. I could see myself asleep in bed; I was hovering perhaps six feet away, up near one of the corners of my room. I could tell by the way the light was flitting through the shades that it was early-ish morning, maybe 7:00 or so. Anyways, I was watching myself when my mother came in and tried to wake me up to watch Pokemon on TV--Hey, I was six years old. Anyways, I watched her trying to shove me awake. After a few shoves I saw myself sit up in bed (this is the freaky part...) and mummble something along the lines of &quot;I&#039;d rather just stay in bed&quot;. My mom said &quot;OK&quot; and turned to leave. My body fell back into the bed, and after this the OBE didn&#039;t last too much longer...I either don&#039;t remember the rest of it or I shifted back into &quot;normal sleep&quot;.<br />
<br />
What I wonder is...if I was outside of my body watching myself, how was I able to get up and speak to my mother? I wasn&#039;t even in my body! o.O<br />
<br />
Anyways, later (around 9:30), I wake up. I didn&#039;t remember my OBE at this time, but I did notice it was 9:30, and I was pissed that my mom didn&#039;t wake me up for Pokemon. I went downstairs and had breakfast. After a few minutes, I asked why she didn&#039;t wake me up at 7:00. She seemed a bit surprised, and told me she had woken me up at 7:00 but I had said I wanted to sleep in. I said I didn&#039;t even remember waking up, which at that time was true. And I kind of forgot about it, until later that night when I remembered my OBE. I thought until recently it was just a weird dream, but now I&#039;m not sure... &gt;.&gt;</div>
		<textarea style="display: none;" id="desctxt_7298">Mmm, there&#039;s only one thing sort of &quot;paranormal&quot;, but it&#039;s not related to ghosts or anything...when I was about six years old, I had an OBE. I could see myself asleep in bed; I was hovering perhaps six feet away, up near one of the corners of my room. I could tell by the way the light was flitting through the shades that it was early-ish morning, maybe 7:00 or so. Anyways, I was watching myself when my mother came in and tried to wake me up to watch Pokemon on TV--Hey, I was six years old. Anyways, I watched her trying to shove me awake. After a few shoves I saw myself sit up in bed (this is the freaky part...) and mummble something along the lines of &quot;I&#039;d rather just stay in bed&quot;. My mom said &quot;OK&quot; and turned to leave. My body fell back into the bed, and after this the OBE didn&#039;t last too much longer...I either don&#039;t remember the rest of it or I shifted back into &quot;normal sleep&quot;.

What I wonder is...if I was outside of my body watching myself, how was I able to get up and speak to my mother? I wasn&#039;t even in my body! o.O

Anyways, later (around 9:30), I wake up. I didn&#039;t remember my OBE at this time, but I did notice it was 9:30, and I was pissed that my mom didn&#039;t wake me up for Pokemon. I went downstairs and had breakfast. After a few minutes, I asked why she didn&#039;t wake me up at 7:00. She seemed a bit surprised, and told me she had woken me up at 7:00 but I had said I wanted to sleep in. I said I didn&#039;t even remember waking up, which at that time was true.

		<div id="post_7299" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Alright, this is a bit of a long story.<br />
<br />
About 5 years ago, it was late afternoon and I was just getting out of school when I went over to my fiancee&#039;s house. To make a long story short. I went to sleep apparently she also had fallen asleep. I must have slept a while because when I cracked my eyes it was dark. Thats all I could do though, crack my eyes. I could not move, complete paralysis. Well sleep paralysis is ok but there are three things I do not understand. <br />
<br />
1. When I could crack my eyes I saw to grey figures in the doorway about 4&#039; tall and very built. <br />
2. It was night but when I had waken up it was afternoon again.<br />
3. My fiancee explained this to me in great detail because this had happened to her also long before I said anything.<br />

I may as well mention another experience of mine (same age) where I got out of bed to use the bathroom and the light was already on and I heard someone in there. I assumed it was my mother so I went inside and shut the door, but there was nobody inside, suddenly the light went off in the room and I heard heavy breathing. I scrambled for the light switch and couldn&#039;t find it so I just ran out of the bathroom (which was then locked so I had to turn the lock mechanism first) and I jumped back into bed.<br />

Interesting stories btw. Psied your experiences were also at an early-ish age it would seem, more or less before puberty. Nice stuff</div>

<br />
It seems like my family is a sort of epicenter for paranormal activity. I&#039;m not sure why this is. Obviously most of us are sensitive to that sort of thing...But are we all just coincidentally finding places with manifestations, or are they drawn to us somehow? I think it might go both ways. All I know is that I&#039;ve never lived someplace without some form of activity. <br />
<br />
My father&#039;s old house was haunted. It wasn&#039;t the pleasant kind of haunting either. It was the evil feeling stuff...There was just really bad vibes in that house.<br />
<br />
No matter what, it was always cold. <br />
<br />
My father had built us this train table. Every once in a while, there would be really loud knocking underneath it...Take your hand and rap your knuckles hard under your desk. That&#039;s probably as close as a description as I can give you. It happened even when we moved it. <br />
<br />
We heard voices a lot. My mom, dad, brother and I. Each had our own experiences with it. <br />
<br />
My brother was up in his room once playing and he thought he heard the t.v. on in the living room, and all of us up talking together. He went out there, and there was nothing. We were all asleep.<br />
<br />
I was lying in my bed one day and from my doorway I heard two voices. They sounded like teenagers...A girl and a boy. I heard &quot;hey kid-over here!&quot;.<br />
<br />
All of us frequently heard each other&#039;s voices...Which weren&#039;t really our voices at all...<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, the cabinet doors would open and shut by themselves. Things would fly off the counters.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of knocking noises. Mostly heard in the living room and my parent&#039;s room. The knocking started on one wall near the floor, went up the wall, across the ceiling, and down the other wall.<br />
<br />
One time my mom was trying to sleep and the knocking started and she said &quot;cut it out!&quot; and it stopped.<br />
<br />
My cat lived with us in that house. She kind of went crazy there. She would run around the house and dart her eyes everywhere. She ripped out all her fur that she could reach on her back. <br />
<br />
I think that there was at least one nice entity in that house...A little boy. One day we were all sitting in the kitchen and we heard my cat meowing and we look over toward the doorway and there&#039;s this silhouette of this little boy hovering on the wall, and my cat was batting at it.<br />
<br />
There would frequently be cold spots in that house. It&#039;s like you&#039;re walking, and it&#039;s warm (as warm as it got in there), then all of a sudden it&#039;s like you stepped into ice.<br />
<br />
When we were little, there was a thunderstorm. My brother and I got scared and ran and jumped into bed with my dad. He had a picture of us on his dresser. It flew off the dresser and smashed into the wall across the room.<br />
<br />
We were always so, so sick in that house.<br />
<br />
One time my dad was up in the attic. We were getting down our stuff for Christmas. There was only one lightbulb in the attic. It just sort of hung down. It blew up. Literally just shattered.<br />
<br />
Of the rooms, it felt like mine was the worst. Just the feeling in there. There was something odd about my closet. I never wanted to go in it. There was always a breeze blowing out of it...One night my dad and I had a dream that we got sucked into my closet. Literally. He woke up in the morning to tell me about his dream, and I filled in the parts. It was really odd. I&#039;ve never had that happen since, and I don&#039;t understand why it happened then..<br />
<br />
My brother&#039;s room felt the safest. I&#039;m not sure why that is. Maybe it&#039;s because he didn&#039;t acknowledge it. Or tried not to. If something happened, he always plugged his ears and said &quot;It&#039;s not real, it&#039;s not real.&quot; and ran into his room. They say acknowledging these things, fearing them, things like that. It gives them more power to materialize. That&#039;s the only thing I can come up with for why his room felt like a safe haven. We often bunked up there together. Our parents didn&#039;t know. I slept on the floor by his bed. Then my parents would come in in the morning and he&#039;d act like I snuck in. Anyways off track.<br />
<br />
One night we were up late playing in his room. My parents were asleep. We heard this odd noise coming from the living room. We had no idea what it was. So we go out there...My mom had this cukoo clock hanging above the train table. It hadn&#039;t worked in 50 years. No one could fix it. But suddenly it was working. This freaked us out-for apparent reasons. So my brother climbs up on the train table, and he takes off the pendulum. It stops working. We&#039;re like okay great. We go back into his room and play again.<br />
<br />
Later we hear the same noise. We&#039;re like no way...So we go out there and it&#039;s working again. This time we take off the weights. It stops. No weight. Clock doesn&#039;t work. It SHOULDN&#039;T work...We go back to playing.<br />
<br />
Then we hear it again. By this time we&#039;re a little hysteric...There&#039;s no WAY it should have started working without the weights. So we just took it off the wall and threw it down on the train table. Then the knocking under the train table starts...<br />
<br />
Remember this clock. It&#039;ll come up later.<br />
<br />
One day my brother and I are watching t.v. We start hearing the knocking noises and it scares us. My mom&#039;s on the way out of the house and we told her we were scared. She&#039;s like well try talking to it. <br />
<br />
Brilliant idea, that.<br />
<br />
So the little peons we were, we&#039;re like &quot;Hello Mr. Ghost...Do you like to watch t.v.? What&#039;s your favorite channel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the t.v. just went all blank and fuzzy. You know, that white static. <br />
<br />
Guess it didn&#039;t like t.v. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
This is only part of the stories from there...<br />
<br />
Alright. Weird things about the house (aside from obvious). My dad rented this house. The previous occupants were an old couple. Apparently they just left the house one day. Disappeared. Left all their belongings.<br />
<br />
One side of the attic in that house was boarded up. We didn&#039;t know why. My dad regrets not taking it down and seeing what was on the other side. <br />
<br />
Legends around the neighborhood about the house. There were some good ones.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll say the one that stuck with me the most. <br />
<br />
There was a young couple living in the house. They had a newborn baby. They smothered it with a pillow and threw its body in the corner of the attic. The side that is now boarded up..<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways moving on. I&#039;ve moved twice since then. When we moved out of that house, we ended up putting a lot of our belongings into a storage area. Later, when we moved again, we went through the storage area. We threw away things that we didn&#039;t want to drag with us across the country. We found the clock.<br />
<br />
We smashed the clock into tiny pieces and we threw all the pieces into the dumpster.<br />
<br />
Now we&#039;re in the other house. Been here about a year. Up until recently, a lot of our stuff has been in the garage. Lately we&#039;ve taken to sorting through the boxes. My dad was going through one and he&#039;s like &quot;AH!&quot;. We&#039;re like what what? He holds up his hand. He&#039;s holding the pendulum to the clock. At this point we&#039;re pretty stunned. We smashed that clock and threw it away. There&#039;s no WAY it could have gotten into the box. Even if we pretend that the pieces somehow flew into other boxes. THIS box he never opened. It was his old cassettes. It&#039;s been taped up to hell for years and years. <br />
<br />
So we joked. We&#039;re like watch. Every box we open up will have a piece of the clock in it.<br />
<br />
So we&#039;re going through more boxes...<br />
<br />
And my mom opens this box, and she picks something up, and she&#039;s staring at it. She turns around. She&#039;s got the weights of the clock in her hand.<br />
<br />
Creepy.<br />
<br />
So we&#039;ve decided, if we find all the pieces of the clock, we&#039;re putting it back together.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have tons more stories. But I&#039;d love to get some replies first. So far no one has talked to me. *Cries*<br />

There was a young couple living in the house. They had a newborn baby. They smothered it with a pillow and threw its body in the corner of the attic. The side that is now boarded up..


Anyways moving on. I&#039;ve moved twice since then. When we moved out of that house, we ended up putting a lot of our belongings into a storage area. Later, when we moved again, we went through the storage area. We threw away things that we didn&#039;t want to drag with us across the country. We found the clock.

We smashed the clock into tiny pieces and we threw all the pieces into the dumpster.

Now we&#039;re in the other house. Been here about a year. Up until recently, a lot of our stuff has been in the garage. Lately we&#039;ve taken to sorting through the boxes. My dad was going through one and he&#039;s like &quot;AH!&quot;. We&#039;re like what what? He holds up his hand. He&#039;s holding the pendulum to the clock. At this point we&#039;re pretty stunned. We smashed that clock and threw it away. There&#039;s no WAY it could have gotten into the box. Even if we pretend that the pieces somehow flew into other boxes. THIS box he never opened. It was his old cassettes. It&#039;s been taped up to hell for years and years. 

So we joked. We&#039;re like watch. Every box we open up will have a piece of the clock in it.

So we&#039;re going through more boxes...

And my mom opens this box, and she picks something up, and she&#039;s staring at it. She turns around. She&#039;s got the weights of the clock in her hand.

Creepy.

So we&#039;ve decided, if we find all the pieces of the clock, we&#039;re putting it back together.

Anyways, I have tons more stories. But I&#039;d love to get some replies first. So far no one has talked to me. *Cries*</textarea><hr style="margin-top: 10px;" /><span style="float: left;"></span>

		<div id="post_12654" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Oh my god Subliminal, that&#039;s one of the creepiest, and best posts I&#039;ve ever read. I want to know if you&#039;ll ever find the rest of that creepy clock. O_O<br />
<br />
Anyway here are some of my stories.<br />
The house I&#039;m living in now I&#039;ve moved from a few times but always end up coming back.<br />
The freakiest story I have is one where My sister, My brother, my cousin, and me were doing a seance.(I know not something people should do.) We were just starting to clean up because we did the seance and nothing happened. As I was standing up from sitting on the floor I almost fell down and had alot of pain in me left shoulder, so my sister took a look at it for me and I had a very dark purple bruise on the front and back of my left shoulder. I remember saying &quot;It feels like I got stabbed with a knife.&quot; Although I&#039;m sure it didn&#039;t hurt as bad as that would. But it was still a painful experience. Since then we have, some how, decided that the two ghosts are of an old man, whom I have seen one clearly out of the corner of my eye, and a small girl, who has sang behind the toilet while I was on it once. The old man, I&#039;m not sure who he is, but he has a rather gaunt face and wear a faded business suit. I get very bad vibes from him. The girl seems nicer. Although still a bit creepy. Once my sister and cousin were walking into the yard, walking up the driveway, my sister heard a little girl ask her &quot;Wanna play?&quot;. Then my sister bolted and left our cousin there. Another time my sister says she rolled over in her bed so she was facing the middle of the room and saw a small girl wearing overalls. Still another time my sister had a battery powered barbie car with light up headlights that had no batteries in it. It turned itself on, headlights and all, and just drove straight off the shelf it was on.<br />
<br />
If you read all that then thanks. XD Its pretty long.</div>

		<div id="post_12662" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hell yeah, I&#039;ll tell you if we ever get the pieces haha. <br />
<br />
I had an experience with a toy getting messed with too. Talking toy. Voice slowly got slower and slower and deeper and deeper. I screamed and dropped it and ran off haha. My mom said it was the batteries. Well I came back to it later and it worked just fine. Never touched it again after that. <br />
<br />
In my dad&#039;s old house my mother and father usually always felt like they were being held down. I realize now that this sounds like sleep paralysis. I&#039;m not dismissing the idea, but I have to throw out there that they have never felt that since moving. <br />
<br />
My brother and I use to always wake up feeling like we&#039;d been slammed into our beds. Once again, I&#039;m not going to say that this is paranormal in any way. I believe it is, but I&#039;m not close-minded. And once again, we never experienced that since moving out of the house.<br />
<br />
Guess I&#039;ll leave that house alone for now told enough fun about it. The other stuff isn&#039;t nearly as fun though.<br />
<br />
The next house we moved into. An old man had died in that house. A few times when my mom was alone there she played the radio. It would switch stations by itself. Usually to a jazz station. <br />
<br />
Occasionally we&#039;d hear disembodied voices. I think the loudest one we ever had was a girl&#039;s voice going &quot;LA LA LA LA LA LA&quot;. Sounds stupid but it was creepy. It was so loud and was so close to us (my dad brother and me-we were in the kitchen) that we all jumped. <br />
<br />
My brother plays guitar. Occasionally we&#039;d hear his guitar play. But he wouldn&#039;t be home, his room would be empty. I play violin, and we&#039;d sometimes jam in his room. We got into the habit of using a tape recorder to check and see how we sounded and make corrections and stuff. One time we caught a voice on it. Sounded deep and male, and it was whispered. It actually said my name. Exciting, right? Ha. Anyways, it creeped us out because we hadn&#039;t heard it at the time that it was apparently said. <br />
<br />
Sometimes we&#039;d get these heavy perfume type smells out of nowhere. My mom identified it as being the perfume of one of my deceased grandmothers. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s what it really is. We also smelled pipe smoke. Another of my deceased grandfathers always smoked a pipe. So we think that was from him...<br />
<br />
Occasionally you&#039;d get stuff like hair pulling, getting breathed on, and feeling like you&#039;re getting tugged on.<br />
<br />
One night I was lying in bed and it felt like someone ran their fingers through my hair. My mom apparently had the same thing happen to her before that. <br />
<br />
My brother felt like something grabbed his foot. <br />
<br />
We all felt the sensation of getting blowed on. Mostly neck or ear. <br />
<br />
If there were odd sounds, they&#039;d usually come from the attic. Sometimes we swore we heard footsteps. I think the creepiest sound I ever heard in that house was one night I was lying in bed and it sounded like something was dragging itself across the attic. Like someone walking while dragging their feet. Made me think of zombies or something. The visual did not help me XD<br />
<br />
And that concludes another ramble which I&#039;ll add on if anyone says something else haha. <br />

About the whole stuff, I might sound crazy but i would like to have at least one such experience. I&#039;ve missed that out completely as far as I can remember. The only paranormal things that happened around me which I can remember are slight shadows I see from time to time or when I think there something at the border of my view. And once, I was pretty small then I think about 4-6 years old, I saw what I think out of my memory would have been a UFO. It was night and I was with my parents from the way from my grandma to church I think, she lives in a small village. There where light in the air and seemed to come from about 20 meters height above or behind a house which was about 150 meters away from us, so really not much. These lights had all different colors and seemed to run in a circle.<br />
I just remembered that years after I experienced it, the time I saw it I didn&#039;t think much about it, so I cant be sure if my memory is correct or just modified by childish fantasy.</div>

Hey, it&#039;s not crazy to want to experience this stuff. I&#039;ve experienced it, and I still want more. <br />
<br />
A UFO...That&#039;s pretty cool. That&#039;s something I wish I could see.<br />
<br />
Sorry this post is kind of small. I&#039;m a little busy right now so I can&#039;t write as much as I want to. I will share one thing right now though. <br />
<br />
My brother and I used to spend summers at my grandma&#039;s house. Her house was a two story with a walk out basement. It backed up to the woods. <br />
<br />
Well one day my brother, cousin, and I were playing out in the backyard. I&#039;m not sure which of us noticed it first. <br />
<br />
Looking out into the woods, we saw a woman. Now, that wouldn&#039;t be so odd, except...She was standing on this wooden platform up in the trees. Nude. <br />
<br />
If that wasn&#039;t weird enough, she was taking a shower. There was a spout literally coming out of the tree.<br />
<br />
We ran inside and got our parents and brought them out to show them, but she was gone.  The wooden platform, the spout...gone. <br />
<br />
They looked at us like we were crazy, and put it down to a game or our imaginations.<br />
<br />
Even to me it sounds crazy. I know what I saw, but even so, I might think that I had imagined it. Except my brother still swears to this day that he saw it, that it was really there. And that means something, because he&#039;s still got that &quot;fuck that noise&quot; attitude. For him to admit it...Well. I have to admit. That was probably the oddest thing I have ever seen.<br />

I&#039;ll be half way finished (and I usually spend AT LEAST an hour if not a few on my artwork) and then decide that it doesn&#039;t seem to express what I was trying to express or it looks like crap. I hate it, but I would say it&#039;s more important to be satisfied with your work rather than disappointed.<br />
<br />
There must have been a house of some sort during that time, but then it got destroyed along with the woman in it? I have read somewhere before that ghosts always think they are still living in their own time when they really aren&#039;t. I&#039;m not sure how someone could back up that theory perfectly, but I guess it makes sense to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s my turn to tell a bit of a story. This happened to me two nights in a row, and I was 12 at the time. (I&#039;m now 16 if anyone is curious)<br />
<br />
I awoke sometime during the night and was terrified. Why? Because I could hear someone running up and down my stairs REALLY loudly. I counted and they ran up and down the stairs exactly ten times. The next morning I asked both my parental figures if they heard it but they apparently didn&#039;t. Till this day I still wonder what it was, but I think I have a more logical explanation to this, two actually:<br />

I think I might have experienced a false awakening (It&#039;s when you wake up in your bed and you THINK you are awake, but your still really dreaming, you just THINK it&#039;s reality, and people always have scary or strange experiences from this, then wake up and thank the Lord they are REALLY awake this time)<br />
<br />
Either that, or maybe it could have been my mother figure exercising...yeah not to be mean or anything but umm...well she is on the chunky side...so uhh...yeah. You wouldn&#039;t believe how much your legs hurt if you were to run up and down the stairs. Seriously try it, and it will feel like your gonna die.</div>
