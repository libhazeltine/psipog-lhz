		<div id="post_7525" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">For a long time I obsessed over telekinesis, I needed telekinesis. Not only only to fulfil a childish dream about magic/superpowers/wonder/ do something really cool, but to prove to myself once and for all that this reality we live in, these things that we have been brought up to believe aren&#039;t just fact. I wanted to know that there was more, and I wanted to explore that “more”.<br />
<br />
After a while, I got lucky, it started working, I could move the psi wheel. Great, but maybe I was wrong about it all maybe it was a fluke I thought. I reproduced this over and over again, I moved on to moving multiple psi wheels at the same time ( which actually took a lot out of me, mentally).<br />
<br />
After this small success one would imagine that I would have continued on with my pursuit, but what I had done was what I wanted to do. I had figured out that this thing everyone says is fake is actually real, I mean I did it in front of my friend, I filmed it over and over again and watched the videos scrutinising it, I knew now that if I and my friend and the camera weren&#039;t crazy, than what is and isn&#039;t possible was up for grabs.<br />
<br />
But I stopped practising with the psi wheel, I stopped a lot of my psionic practice. And Now I&#039;m wondering, so what? What does it matter, what does it prove? It doesn&#039;t prove anything, it only disproves, disproves the idea that we know all, shows that things people consider to be facts aren&#039;t facts at all. But so what? What now? What is the point of our psionic practice.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is still reading, I would like your thoughts. Why do you do it? What do you hope to achieve by doing it? And for those of you who have had success, how do you feel now?</div>

A similar attitude is taken by the best Buddhist teachers, and in one of the Pali scriptures there is an ancedote recording the Buddha&#039;s own characteristically dry comment on a prodigious  feat of levitation performed by one of his disciples. &quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;will not conduce to the conversion of the unconverted, nor to the advantage of the converted.&quot; Then he went back to talking about deliverance.&quot;<br />

If we can bring this out of the level of psudoscience and into the realm of an aplicateable science then maybe we can help alot of people reach that dream. Imagine this, we all work together and bring about an &quot;awakening&quot; of sorts and all people every where could then use psychic powers. people continue to use them and use them and give praise to the people who helped start it all.<br />
