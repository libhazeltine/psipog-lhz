Perhaps one day, when I stop procrastinating about everything, I will begin practicing some tai chi myself and observe how it affects my own abilities.<br />

Chi seems to me like a much less subtle form of psi because of how destructive it can be when used correctly. Bruce Lee supposedly used chi to power his punching-bag-breaking punches and kicks.<br />

Can you manipulate chi efficiently, Zectra? If so, how do you use it and how does it affect your energy manipulation in general?</div>

		<div id="post_8057" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Well,  I started kung fu and Qi gong/Tai Chi classes a while ago, and I&#039;ve learned how to manipulate energy from a chi perspective probably a lot more than I did from a psi perspective (and I studied psi for..almost eight years).<br />
<br />
I use chi mostly in my kung fu classes plus my daily training a lot like what you would see in the videos above or with Bruce Lee, like you mentioned..  though I find it&#039;s also pretty useful externally..  occasionally when I find out one of my friends is having a bad time, I take a few minutes to &#039;pour&#039; my own energy into them to comfort them and help them think more clearly..  and lately I&#039;ve been looking into it a lot for physical healing purposes.<br />
<br />
As for as chi goes with affecting my energy manipulation in general, I have to say it&#039;s helped multiply my own skills much more than what they were before, especially local sense and empathy.<br />
For comparison..  before I started Tai Chi,  I could &quot;feel&quot; a slight tingle of other peoples energy when I walked by them,  but after a year or so of dedicated practice, I started physically feeling like I was walking through a.. &quot;Thick Soup&quot; of energy, thoughts, and emotions everywhere I went o_o  <br />
(That got pretty annoying though, so I had to start shielding from it a lot xD)<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end..It&#039;s helped so much and emphasized the connection between energy manip and other abilities(Like TK), that whenever someone comes to me to learn and asks where they should start to learn this ability.. or that ability..(anything from pyrokinesis, to phasing and AP),  I always tell them to meditate and develop their ability to manipulate and control their energy as much as they possibly can, not just as a jumping off point, but as a fundamental practice that they should continue to practice through their entire path in psi or chi.<br />
<br />
It really does seem to have a base connection to everything, and like it shows in the videos above,  your own abilities can become increasingly powerful the more dedicated you are to it.</div>

<br />
I once read that it is wiser to increase your energy sensitivity before using a desensitizing energy technique, such as the iron shirt/vest technique so that you will be able to tell if you are getting seriously injured.<br />
<br />
And I do agree with you that it should be used as a lifelong practice and not a springboard for &quot;bigger and better things&quot;.<br />

Well, that is all I have to say for now. I that hope others begin to reply to your thread.</div>

Yeah I know =P.  It&#039;s very helpful.  I&#039;ve loved every moment in TaiChi.<br />

Oh yes, there are a TON of TaiChi schools in the USA, and I do live here.<br />
You should google TaiChi and your home state.. probably KungFu and your state as well, because most KungFu schools do one form of TaiChi or QiGung or another..  They&#039;re just don&#039;t advertise as much as taekwondo, karate, or Aikido does.</div>

		<div id="post_10209" style="width: 100%; overflow: auto; min-height: 125px;">Hey guys, a great martial art to check out would be Aikido.  Like other martial arts, it focuses on drawing from one&#039;s personal power, but rather than psi or chi, they call it &quot;ki&quot; (hence, aiKIdo).<br />
<br />
In Aikido, they say to draw your ki from your &quot;hara&quot;, or your center of gravity, through deep breathing, balance and concentration.  Your hara, for most people, is just above your naval.  <br />
<br />
This concept largely interested me because it makes sense that your energy would settle at your center of gravity, whether this be our potential energy as a result of gravity&#039;s effect on you, or a mystical &quot;ki&quot; or psi energy.  Also, I find it interesting that we commonly relate our psionic control to our nerves and our center of gravity is supposed to be just above our naval, which contains the most cluster of nerves you can find in the human body (e.g. it is the most painful place to receive an injury).<br />
<br />
Any input on this?</div>

<br />
It also depends on what you&#039;re looking for in your training though.<br />
Aikido is a soft form Martial Art(Don&#039;t mix that up with &quot;internal&quot;) with the intent on manipulating your opponent and their weight in order to throw them off balance with the littlest of energy. They also throw some Kendo into the study to help you become better attuned with handling weapons; receiving or dealing.<br />
<br />
Oh-Sensei developed the system a long time ago by studying different martial art&#039;s an their joint manipulation techniques and such, as well as through his own study, then adding to them and expanding on certain qualities.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of Martial Arts though, the key points to it&#039;s system can be strung back to origins in China and Kung Fu.<br />
I&#039;ve seen at least half of the techniques and ideas expressed in Kung Fu and it&#039;s Chi Na(Qinna) areas. <br />
<br />
It&#039;d be a good idea to look into both Aikido and Kung fu;<br />
Kung fu giving a large variety of insight on both hard and soft form, while Aikido specializes in soft form and weapon disarming.<br />
<br />
Coupled with Tai Chi, the three make a great combination.<br />

Yes, both Aikido and Kung fu use this area as.. &#039;energy sources&#039; you could say; Which also happens to be one of the chakras.<br />
<br />
In kung fu though, they store their energy slightly lower than that in their dan tien, then when practicing or fighting, allow it to rise up to &quot;hara&quot; as you called it, or slightly higher, then press it back down again once they&#039;ve finished their fight/form to compress and stabilize the energy in their dan tien again.<br />
<br />
You can see the difference in their actions in between the changes if you watch their forms.<br />
<br />
(Also, Ki is the Japanese interpretation of Chi/Qi, and most people believe those are the same as psi, but it&#039;s controversial.)</div>
