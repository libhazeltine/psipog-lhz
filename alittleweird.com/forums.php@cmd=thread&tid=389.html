I think I found out why I forget the vast majority of my dreams. They are all horrific nightmares.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always been intrigued by the idea of lucid dreaming (I have had only two, both by accident). I know that the first step is to remember your dreams, but this has always been super hard for me. I can only do it probably once every two weeks, and everytime it is a nightmare.<br />
<br />
These aren&#039;t normal nightmares, they&#039;re ones that everyone knows you&#039;ve had. They&#039;re the kind that you wake up in tears, and can barely function throughout the rest of the day. They are the nightmares that don&#039;t scare you with the boogey-man, but scare you with people you love dying or, like tonight, alienating you.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give you tonights as an example, and I have another that I can tell you if you want that has always haunted me. I don&#039;t remember how it started, but I do remember my girlfriend being terrified of ghosts or something evil that only she could see, and I took her to the radio tower to keep her safe. She is going almost insane, and I&#039;m really worried. Then she goes up this ladder (DO NOT READ IF YOU&#039;RE GOING TO FREUD ME, PLEASE) and I hear sex noises. I go up, and she is having sex, I know this in the dream, but I cannot see or &#039;sense&#039; what. After which, she is cold and emotionless to me. She demands in a flat voice that &quot;you should hold me because I&#039;m cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess it might not sound bad but I&#039;m almost sick to my stomach. This kind of thing happens every time. Do you think it&#039;s because I&#039;m forcing it, or do I really dream like that all the time? Maybe it&#039;s just that I only remember these, but it seems to me like they only happen when I try. Should I stop, because my subconscious doesn&#039;t want me to try it anymore? Any advice or ideas would be appreciated.</div>

Some of the places recur, and some of the people. But yeah, the main theme in all of these dreams is losing (physically or emotionally) someone I love. I know that my current girlfriend has a history of abuse, and part of me (the irrational part) might be afraid that she&#039;s just using me because I&#039;m a nice guy? I&#039;m not sure. I do know you&#039;re right, and there is some important symbolism there. Hell, it might be related to another nightmare that a book gave me. Ever read American Gods? Well, the thing that bothered me about the book is that the guy&#039;s wife cheated on him, but still loved him. Idk I&#039;m sure it&#039;s all my insecurities blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I don&#039;t want to be remembering these dreams. I want to lucid dream, or no nightmares, but it seems like I can&#039;t have either. I can deal with a good cry in the morning every now and then, you know, but it&#039;s putting kind of a damper on my enthusiasm.</div>

<br />
Perhaps being able to confront these dreams would be a valuable skill; after all they are just dreams. If it is that you are just worried about losing your girlfriend maybe you should talk to her about it? If things are all peachy and she likes you and what not then it should help you with your dreams. However, if you are getting the feeling that she is just using you, perhaps you should attempt to come to terms with things and truly view them as they are. <br />
<br />
Constant nightmares could be a sign of stress; Maybe if you tackle the source of that stress your dreams will ease up.<br />

<br />
Other than outside forces, like job stress and stuff like that (although I have a relatively stress-free life right now, aside from school), everything between me and my girlfriend is fine. I&#039;m not concerned about her being unfaithful/using me or any of that in REAL life.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure the reason that I have these dreams is because the easiest way to get to me is to hurt the people I love/like/whatever. I&#039;m the kind of person that gets walked over but will kill for their friends, and that&#039;s why these dreams are so bad, is because I can&#039;t do anything to stop the dream from hurting them. That&#039;s what I think happened to her, btw, in the dream. Something hurt her and she just closed up, away from the world and me particularly.<br />
<br />
The thing that gets me though is I pretty much only have these when I want to remember my dreams. Coincidence? It almost feels like I&#039;m being distracted from what I&#039;m trying to do intentionally.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I think I should mention, it&#039;s not always about her. I&#039;ve had them for maybe 2 or 3 years now, and it&#039;s been past girlfriends, friends, relatives, anyone I&#039;m close to.</div>

I was told that, when i could actually remember a dream, to write it down and date it. Keep a journal of sorts. Then read your last few entries before bed. It helped me for a while but like i said, I have stopped dreaming now so i haven&#039;t done that in a long time.<br />

Yeah, the journal thing is what I&#039;m trying to do now, but it doesn&#039;t seem to help much. I&#039;m giving it a bit longer to work though, just in case.<br />

Well, turns out that I&#039;m not allowed to sleep anymore. Every time I got close to sleep last night &#039;something&#039; smashed into my sleep like a hammer, that&#039;s the only way I can described it. I would be asleep, but not in that deep sleep, almost dreaming, when I was forced out of it. It was a weird experience, although I doubt it was anything &quot;weird&quot;, if you know what I mean. So I&#039;m running on no sleep.<br />

<br />
Recalling dreams is merely a part of the process. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read many things on the topic. Dream journals, etc. I would highly recommend this. But I&#039;d also recommend something else. <br />
<br />
Reality checks. But kindof... modified for your situation. The best way to overcome this in your dreams through lucidity is possibly this way. Because these fears are, as seemingly stated by you, unjustified, unlikely, and unlike the real life you live in, you need to embrace the dreams you&#039;ve had. I would say that by thinking about them, even aloud, about all the bad things that happened would be enough to get gears turning. Upon thinking of these things, you must rationalise that they are not reality and not things that are likely to happen. You must further state to yourself (again, in your thoughts or aloud would also help) that you must be dreaming when things like that happen.<br />
<br />
That should be more than enough to help you become a littlem ore rational in your dreaming and realize it&#039;s all just a, well, dream. :D</div>

I&#039;m not sure if this is much help but this is what i did to develop my lucid dreaming. to be honest i never wrote my dreams down or anything all i realy did was practise my &#039;strength of will&#039; what i mean is basicly if something bad was to happen i pratised my ability to refuse whats happening, which allowed me to alter my dreams from that i got to lucid dreaming (like the time i dreamed i was in house that was hit by a nuke and everyone died including me, however after fading out of my body i decided it simply wasnt my time to die, well in the dream anyway, and so i re-materialised etc etc.) anyway getting back to the topic if you pratice the willpower thing then it also might help you with your nightmares. Good Luck.</div>
